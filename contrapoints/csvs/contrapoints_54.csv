"Hello girls, let's talk about bone structure 💀"
"So, I don't know if anyone has mentioned this, but I think you are *far far* more attractive than Gigi Gorgeous, but then I find conventional beauty standards flat, conventional and uninspiring. Like, most 'makeovers', I think the people looked way better *before* the makeover then after, when they look like Beauty School Drones.  Er, my point is not to insult or minimize Gigi, just that standards of beauty can be different for different people. I think you are beautiful, and (for me a much more important standard), you look interesting. Not 'interesting' in that left handed compliment way, but interesting in the sense that you look like someone it would be interesting to know and be around.  Um, I hope that's not unintentionally hurtful.or insulting? That certainly is not my intent. But I struggled over my looks for a long time, myself. I thought I was hideous, and no amount of external validation made a dent. So I understand a little? I hope you get, or are getting, to be comfortable in your skin, because to not be is just *awful*.  Um, I hope I'm not being...weird? Too weird? It's been brought to my attention that my communication style.can be off-putting. I just want to let you know I find you and your aesthetic style (and appearance) enjoyable to look at. I look forward to your putting out another video."
"I know you aren’t asking for feedback, but you are really beautiful and intelligent! I’m very much attracted to you!"
"They should have said 'at least you don't look like Baltimore Maryland' 😂 You look cute to me and you are plased yeah? So you do you boo boo💕"
"You’re right. If all men died tomorrow, wearing makeup would become a common thing for me."
"OMG the pikachu!😂😂"
"The lesbians aren't immune :( especially us millenials. Dreaded, terrible, soul-sucking millenials. I've encountered a significant amount of gay women my age who want plastic surgery as well. I want makeup. I want beautiful dresses. I want glittery accessories. I want a rhinoplasty and a blepharoplasty and that surgery where they break your legs and split them so you end up with longer ones in the end."
"A FEW MILLIMETRES OF BONE contrapoints is a female incel confirmed"
"Wizardry"
"How did I miss this channel?"
"This was a really interesting insight."
"god damn do i hate sequins. but for you, contrapoints, ill learn to love anything"
"I find you attractive for no particular reason.  Maybe it's just you."
"f"
"you inspire me to be the first beauty icon of my generation to have thick, voluminously robust armpit hair."
"Why is a lack of body hair considered feminine? I seriously am disappointed in her with this video. Why does she keep calling 'typical stereotypical female' BEAUTIFUL? I dont like makeup and I dont shave my legs because the only reason I did it was for men and to fit in. And I'm not that beautiful now according to Contra?"
"I like her a lot but im confused, so trans people get surgery and get laser epilation but how about  all that feminism? 'beautiful':feminine and legs shaved? is she just gettingn surgery to make people quiet annd not pay her any attention?"
"Every word is witty. How is this possible. Its also asmr lol  Edit: Then she starts doing sequin asmr 🤣"
"i love you"
"Smart people club. I've always been 'oh youre smart' gee thanks but what else..."
"You look more like a girl than I do, and I was born female. Literally once  upon a time I had a pixie cut and so many people assumed I was a boy.  Your are absolutely beautiful, I wish I had the motivation to be more feminine and beautiful, but I’m a lazy procrastinator so that’s not happening anytime soon....."
"I just love your videos!  Outside of some purely comic channels, there are few that leave me smiling like yours do.  Even discussing the most serious subjects, you make me laugh.  Especially these days, that's a wonderful gift. I love your sense of humor. Just want to say thank you for informing and entertaining."
"20:09 'OMG, you're so cute! What a sweet face!' That was my genuine response. :) Thought I better share it."
"i gagged when u said BULGARIAN ROSE WATER wooohoo hi from 🇧🇬"
"I do love Contrapoints, but I also love trolling online. Vote Trump for 2020!"
"I want FFS so much, but it's too expensive and I'm afraid it's out of the cards for me.  I'm very happy for you Natalie, and also very jealous."
"Binged your videos for hours. You're such an amazing person and such a beautiful woman! Lots of love xx"
"I’ve never related to a video so much lol love you. ❤️ You’re beautiful and you can age gracefully. That’s what I tell myself. 🤗💞"
"wow, she looked great before imo, but I think she should be real happy about the subtle changes that she decided to get, the doctors did a great job."
"my flabby arms and I are highly offended lmao"
"anyone else see tina fey?"
"Very disturbing, you can't except yourself like many trans, sad times"
"Every time a watch I video of Nathalie's, I can't help but smile at the fact that it's content creators like her that are literally killing cable T.V. With a measly fraction of the budget that even shitty daytime talk shows have, she manages to generate content that is intellectually stimulating, irreverent, provoking, touching, relatable and funny. I wonder if that's how suburban soccer moms feel when they watch Oprah?"
"Discovered Contrapoints today and have been binging all afternoon!  i think i'm in love!  ;)"
"You're hot...like hawt."
"You are fabulous. As an aging lady (45- super gross), I'm VERY aware of every line and crease now. It's so aggravating. I'm at the gym, under those flourescent (EVIL) lights, and rather than feel good I'm caring for myself, I'm constantly distracted by my puppet lines. :\ boo"
"24:02 got me. 'I'm not a bimbo, I'M A POET.'"
"Not sure how I feel about 'Chad' being a derogatory term......   nah just kiddin I dont give a shit."
"ContraPoints - gorgeous inside and out (not that you need to be)"
"Is feminine sexuality ruled primarily by the desire to be desired?  Or is that just my idea?"
"Babe, you're lovely ❤ I found your channel recently and had watched the Transtrender video wondering who is this lady and how does she get away with playing Trans characters in her videos 😂❤ I never 'clocked' until mentioned at the end of the video or something. I've been binging on your videos anyway, and you yourself the eternal being are absolutely lovely in every last one of them ❤"
"Thanks for the informative and entertaining videos... also you look really great <3"
"without surgery you would look like the man you actually are"
"You’re a man and you can never change that."
"No no, it's *only* caring about beauty or outward appearance that can lead to narcissism and vanity."
"You're honestly so beautiful and I'm very lesbian for you lol"
"You looked amazing before surgery and amazing after, it's your smarts that make you a very attractive and complete package. I love your work and your channel."
"Natalie: “Fighting fascism was an idea I came up with while I was a male alcoholic.” LOL"
"I'm a girl and I want FFS 😔"
"You are so awesome I can barely stand it. Gave all the kudos on Twitter. Discovered you this AM on On The Media. Thank you. Signed, your newest fan."
"This is superb, and I feel so shallow saying this but good lord what a fun dress. I LOVE IT."
"Would a face-blind person saying you look fine be a compliment? The colorful lighting, varied wardrobe and overall editing are more distinctive overall than those before and after images."
"As someone who has had facial surgery (to correct severe underbite) do you ever find it strange that people who have knew you pre-surgery met you with a different face than everyone else you will ever meet after surgery?"
"The sheer bravery of that piece..."
"Betwixt"
"There is no shame in getting professional help and trying to be your best self Natalie. I found a conservative psychiatrist and good therapist and it has helped me."
"So you could just say: beauty = confidence"
"See one thing I'm wondering about is whether or not I'm watching your videos because you are *female looking enough* for me to accept you as an actual female. It's really interesting since - when talking about you - I use 'she', but for most transgender man I still use 'he'. And I don't even mean it offensive. I called someone female on accident because he had a higher pitched voice..."
"Dairy Queen is gonna be full of trans baggage.  Including mine holy fuck"
"holy shit, you changed my view on lots of stuff, especially about peterson's makeup argument."
"I like the synthesized gymnepodie at the end"
"You do need to wear sunscreen, lol. But I do understand that feeling you have, worrying about how you look, not liking how you look. I wish you could see yourself the way we all do. I think you're the cutest when you laugh at your own jokes ! Keep wearing your makeup but see a therapist if you don't already if you keep feeling sad, okay? We love you!"
"That skincare routine with her commentary is the most relatable thing I’ve watched. 😂"
"Beautiful queen! Seen all your videos, and it’s amazing how much you’ve changed even though you’re not done going through all the changes estrogen is gonna give you!"
"Yay for hating conventional beauty standards and the effects it has but also wanting to conform to those standards cause 'yay, pretty'"

"I appreciate any commentary that highlights the things trans and cis people have in common.  So many trans people go to great lengths to make it clear that they are nothing like cis people and have nothing in common, but most people hate their bodies and would like to change them."
"https://www.youtube.com/user/stylelikeu"
"I'm a cis woman and I have a lot of not so feminine features which I'm really insecure about.  So this video is great food for thought"
"I love how skull lady put it"
"PSA: always use sunscreen.. the best thing for your skin"
"if contrapoints made a whole asmr video with her fuckton of sequins i would not complain"
"You look really good now.  You look great when you do characters.  As a gay man, I thought you looked sexier as a man, but that't just me."
"Thanks for being Contrapoints and not a Gigi Gorgeous impersonator. We need less people getting veneers to replace their perfect teeth bc they thought it would look better in pictures."
"Yo I'm a cis woman, and I feel you on like all of this stuff."
"Ugh you spoke directly to my soul in this video"
"Liposuction isn't plastic surgery, it's transfat dysphoria treatment.     Love your channel. You're awesome."
"sometimes PontraCoints scares me"
"I think you’re crazy hot. And I’m a straight (?) cisfemale.  And you’re only 30! I’m in my late 20s and I plan on being super hot for decades!"
"Humans care about beauty because beauty equals healthy, and healthy equals better survival potential, and better survival potential equals evolutionary success. It's just science."
"High-key appreciate you and this vid! I hadn't heard of you and the almighty algorithm fixed that, but let me be clear: YOU ARE GORGEOUS and 100% passing in my opinion. More of an 8 than a 6. Straight up assumed you were a natural female with loud style (in a positive-confidence way and it WORKS)"
"“I’d fuck me too” I’m dying XD"
"Please make an actual ASMR with those sequin things?"
"Hold the phone, you don’t wanna be 5’2. You can’t reach anything and all pants are too long for you."
"I’m not going to say “you were prettier before”. You were pretty before and you’re pretty now, and I’m really glad that you’re explaining it all, so other non-cisgender individuals can see, that you don’t have to, in any way, feel even the least bit ashamed for becoming your true self. But also that it’s a slightly brutal journey, but that just shows how badass people who go through with it are. But also that it’s okay to not get surgery, if it’s what a person wants. Honestly, it’s just stupid that a part of society can’t handle plastic surgery, but at the same time have these insane standards that are hard to meet for any woman or man, but must feel extra restrictive if you’re not born with the  chromosomes you should have had."
"Don't worry! I could swear I thought you were a completely normal woman when I first saw a video on your channel. I was actually quite surprised to find out here that you are trans. Like I can see it only after you said so."
"isn't that quite normal to not exactly know if you're beautiful? at least I feel that way quite often haha"
"Get out of my room mom!"
"Starfish Night 😆"
"I love what is going through your head!"
"14:15 ... In the show 'House MD' they found the easiest way to make patients look sick was to forbid the actors from wearing makeup."
"ContraPoints is so unnerving and creepy."
"Isn't it safer to just secretly fall in love with them while quietly dying inside??? OMG welcome to my lady gay dating strategy. It works! Sort of."
"yeeeaaaah, when you need surgery where they chisel away some of your bone to feel like you're a woman, then I don't think men are the problem here, honey."
"wow, that beginning was f*cking scary as hell for some reason. And I watch horror movies on a daily basis."
"also remember to put on spf every day even if it’s cloudy to prevent rapid aging sis xoxo"
"I’ve noticed a trend of this notion that “beauty equals low intellect” like when people unironically say stuff like “marry a smart loyal girl” and just theoretically “fuck a pretty girl” because “she has eyelashes but does she have brains?” It’s dogma spread around by  men who are literally emasculated by a pretty girl. They see a pretty girl and get triggered bc they have this “no one will fuck me” complex that they believe stems from their looks, and obviously not the big red clown nose that is their shitty personality. So they talk over pretty girls because they believe pretty girls have nothing of substance to even add to a conversation. So they skip the conversation part and get right to “suck my dick” and then go on Facebook and joke about marrying a fat woman. Boy bye"
"In which Natalie gets distracted by sequins for twenty minutes  *and calls out us grad student girls"
"When you're non binary and Contra asks how dare you, it's a good feeling loflz thanks you tube mom! XD"
"Maybe thinking about other people around you might help with reducing the depression."
"you get a like just for SOPHIE"
"21:18 is that a Hunter S. Thompson reference?"
"i refuse to call myself a feminist because a feminist is what you become when you're no good at being a woman, and i'm exceedingly good at being a woman, and i became one the only way there is, the hard way, and so have you, so i'm begging you to stop wishing you were that girl, because you are that girl, already, in spades.   https://youtu.be/p5PBKOE0-AQ"
"14:45 You haven't considered that they might be dykes?"
"yr so smart"
"Does anyone have some sort of infinite loop of pikachu getting down to some synth? thank you all in advance"
"I know this isn't the point of the video at all, and I don't mean this as a critique of your choice in any way, but just so you know (in case you have an residual crappy feelings or worries about not passing before the surgery) looking at those two pictures of your profile with no context it just looks like two different women. I know many women who look like your 'before.' I have a pretty prominent brow and a square jaw line myself. Looking feminine doesn't necessarily mean having a smaller nose, brow, slimmer jawline etc. At the same time I totally get that being trans would make a woman extra sensitive about wanting to have traditionally 'feminine' facial features. It's like all of the physical insecurities cis women have to carry are foisted upon trans women tenfold, and that really sucks."
"FUCK YESS THE SOPHIE"
"Totally out of context but you’re so beautiful and smart and awesome and inspirational astdyfihovjxtd 😬🤠🥰🤟✌️"
"Not fair. We're talking about skulls, where is Foppington?"
"Probably the take with the most errors in it since 'pop-feminism', which should be saying a little bit. Anyway, still great with a lot of great points."
"I screamed when you put the sunscreen down. Brilliant"
"What size shoes do you wear?"
"You look great, Hun."
"Men don't care about being beautiful, because we are already obsessed about being strong."
"This is the first of your videos I've ever seen, WOW! I'm hooked. You're brilliant. Thank you. So fun, so smart. And OMG, those sequins! Yes!  Also, you're damn pretty. I think and I thought so before my fandom (of two seconds ago). I'm so glad that you talk about the fact that it's how we think, and see the world. I hope the world can shift it's view a bit. Let's make some taste and style!"
"I've always felt guilty for wanting to be beautiful but I think I'm slowly accepting that it's not morally wrong, wanting to be beautiful, wanting to be seen as beautiful. Thank you for this video."
"Girl, you're pretty most of the time. And usually when I see you and you aren't it's cause you've gone hard for a bit for the channel. But I know seeing it yourself is harder."
"25:50 we will send you in GULAG for this!"
"Natalie I think you need to ask yourself how there are cis women walking around unconcerned with beauty standards. I hear your struggle but don't assume everyone is experiencing that, many women both cis and trans have broken free of this thinking. Honestly it is partly to do with privilege, a lot of people simply have far bigger problems than worrying about meeting conventional beauty standards. I know radfems are scary because of TERFs but I really don't think you should throw the baby out with the bath water so to speak. Radical feminism has a lot to offer on this point. It's a bummer that when you mention women in academia going without makeup because of sexism (which is very true, I'm not disagreeing with you here), there doesn't seem to be any room in your worldview for women who actually don't feel a preoccupation with beauty, or don't conflate conventional beauty standards with actual beauty, or outright reject conceptions of beauty and it's trappings (like makeup), or all of the above. It's in the experience of the women who hold those views that you'll find self-worth beyond the conventional beauty standards designed to subjugate us."
"Hey gf.  I was watching and listening to a Lady Marmalade vid with Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Mya, and Pink.  I could have given them a run for their money in my day (even now, I still turn heads and look damn good with my awesome silver hair), but I also thought about you who could do so right now.  Just wanted you to know I was thinking about you. : )"
"Feminine gay girl into feminine girls here: TBH, the first video I watched of yours was the incel video, and I had no idea you were trans until you said so. Actually, I was thinking you looked the way I wish I looked, and that you were cute as hell (and that your voice was sultry like Emma Stone’s). My fiancee and I agreed that we’d both hit that. And I’m new to trans culture, so I’m not sure if it’s okay to say, but TBH, after watching your “Are traps gay” video where you described what a girl penis is like, we agreed that we’d both still be down for whatever as long as the penis is attached to a beautiful woman like you (or you specifically, you gorgeous genius. Call me).   And I don’t think there’s anything wrong with wanting to be beautiful, wanting to pass (I prefer to pass as straight, especially when I’m in public alone or with my fiancee, for safety reasons), or wanting to change your body/face to look the way you want. You only have one life, may as well live it looking the way you want.   As a cardholding member of the IBTC (34AA over here), and a girl who could definitely look more feminine, I would get a boobjob and throw in some FFS while I’m under in a heartbeat if breast implants didn’t give you cancer. And I would be doing that to look more like a normal woman and to fit into clothes better, not to attract my partner or other women more. It would all be just for me.   Long story short, if you want to be beautiful and look like a prettier woman than someone who was born as one, you’ve definitely achieved that. And there’s really nothing deeper into women’s culture than an obsession with beauty based on nothing more than achieving the beauty for the sake of it alone. Somehow you understand it better than most women as well, even though you weren’t raised as one.   Let me know if any of that was offensive. It’s not my intention."
"your teeth is cute"
"I feel all of this on a spiritual level and I'm not even trans. I just struggle with femininity so much that it's become a weird kinda complex. It's so weird to be a cisgender woman and be so jealous of how women like John Maclean and even you look. It's not even like I'm ugly. I just aspire to be as feminine as other women and then just get pissed off when it is used against me in conversation or in regard to my intelligence. 🙃🙃🙃🙃 blah the world is dark and full of terrors when you're your own worst critic  Just where are MY biological sequins, dammit"
"<3 love every point you made"
"Ignorant I may be but I had nooo idea they were editing photos to that degree even back then. That B&W shots you showed of that lady  kinda shocked me."
"I LOVE YOU"
"2:53 OMG, I had to stop the video, I was laughing so damn hard. That came out of the blue and smacked me in head (and funny bone). Brilliance!"
"4:36 that's a burn"
"This film making is next level"
"LOL, 24 minutes of rambling to say that the incels are right. Did dig the fear and loathing line though."
"Anyone know the name of the song used at 25:13? It's not any of the ones listed in the descritption. I know I've heard it before and it's driving me nuts..."
"It bothers me the way you characterize academic woman and their rejection of makeup. You bring it back to trying to conform to a male industry by presenting masculine or trying to be 'not like other girls'; as though the rejection of beauty standards could not possibly be driven by self worth and a disconent with culture or the makeup industry"
"Why is this video demonetized?"
"JOURNEY"
"Some super interesting thoughts here. I’m a cis woman and I do care about trying to be beautiful but I consider myself ugly and am also very lazy so I just don’t do anything to my face 99% of the time and usually  just bung my hair in a ponytail. I’ve not thought before about how trans people can tie in gender and beauty together so you may feel less feminine as well as ugly if you don’t put makeup on. I’d not thought about the privilege I have as a cis person of always feeling feminine enough regardless of what I choose to do makeup wise."
"I needed those laughs right now. Thank you so much. Also KINGDOM HEARTS!"
"My own evaluation: Now that you've had this surgery, you 'pass'. I would not be able to 'clock' you. Not sure how much you value the assessment of a 52-year-old gay guy who lives in a white-trash suburb of Milwaukee, but there it is. And I lean more towards the anti-SJW side than the pro-SJW side (though I do think Sargon is turning into a fucking wing-nut), so you need not write my opinion off as 'from a fan'. :-)"
"I do have to say - I found your channel last night when my husband brought your talk about race video to my attention. I had no idea that you were trans until your alter ego appeared in the doorway wanting to debate and talk about her transition. (I realize I have some terms wrong here and the names of the video wrong.) Anyway, here is a new fan dropping in to say 'I think you're gorgeous.' Does this count for anything?"
"I can't stop thinking about 'my face is the real shop front'"
"You can always do what I do. *breaks every mirror before I can look at it* I'm beautiful now! Lol."
"I'd still say FFS is a medically necessary surgery, like anything battling some form of deformation/disfigurement. You're restoring something that shouldn't be, so it's not regular selective plastic surgery, where you alter something that is how it 'should' be."
"I love you"
"you are absolutely brilliant - in all ways!"
"Other than: interesting and well made video, I have only one thing to say.  You kinda look like you're Eastern European to me. Which is probably a good thing considering the gorgeous women they produce."
"Wait you legit looked soooo pretty in the mirror during the bit about feeling pretty once a month, neutral colors look super nice on you"
"Geez -  the invention of the mirror and reflective surfaces altered psychological evolution ?  Just discovered the channel based on a mention by some too far lefty.  My first thought was 'that's a hot chick.'  Watched some early vids also - still think that."
"nat. youre not only gorgeous and beautiful. youre an inspiration"
"From the front you're absolutely still yourself. Very subtle work. I liked you before, and I like you now :) More importantly you sound and look so happy."
"Excellent!!!"
"Also thanks ALOT for introducing me to Sophie im IN YOUR DEBT"
"Wonderful, um, points you made at the end. I agree that using one’s looks as self expression is a great attitude to have. You’ll never lose your personality... (batting head injury or stroke.) I’m 53. So you bet I’ve thought about this. Does this mean I love every sag and wrinkle? No way. But I am always me and I am always kick a**."
"Nooo, the sunscreen actually helps you in comparison to your other products!"
"Aging? Try dealing with that in your fifties. It gets interesting.... to put it mildly."
"I think some of what we think of as attractive is biological. Body hair is determined in part by hormones  and hairy legs, although normal in many, CAN be a symptom of higher testosterone. Hair removal takes that question away. Of course there are some social conventions as well. Then there is marketing. So I applaud those who do what they want. But to be free of any influence is nearly impossible."
"You make so many interesting points! So glad I found your channel!"
"If you still feel the same way about beauty after saying that beauty is a racist, sexist, ableist, transphobic, fatphobic social construct is it not possible that it isn't racist, sexist, ableist, transphobic, fatphobic social construct at all?

Now it just might be the leftist mindset, where the whole world is a racist, sexist, ableist, transphobic, fatphobic social construct, so you become immune to caring about these things, but if I were to genuinely believe something was a racist, sexist, ableist, transphobic, fatphobic social construct then I would stop endorsing it, but you don't, you instead put a great deal of value upon it. Beauty is beyond these petty leftist things, and deep down you know it.   Is a sunset beautiful?"

"Youtube Really helped my body dysphoria, “it’s not nearly as bad as I thought it was”  But  I’m still a social recluse partially because I get distracted feeling ugly around people.  I find making videos hard when I’m depressed."
"It depresses me that I can’t edit out my pores in my YouTube videos.  I feels you"

"I CANNOT imagine having to go through girl puberty again holy mother... I started saving up when I was 12 to get my big middle eastern nose fixed, spent years hating my face, and eventually, at age 17, I decided that I was going to like my face no matter what. That is FIVE YEARS. I genuinely don’t think I could make it through another five years like that, especially if I was dealing with the other issues that transgender women face... y’all are frickin strong."
"Your one of the prettiest women don't forget it!"
"I love you and you’re hilarious and clever and yes, pretty :)"
"yes the sophie song. go off !!!!!!"
"I just wanna give you a hug everytime I finish watching a video of yours. You have so much to say, I am so glad i have found your channel."
"16:20 Me too, sis.  Me too."
"God, even though I’m cis woman who does not experience gender dysphoria, the pressure to fit society’s expectations for beauty and femininity is so stifling that sometimes it overwhelms me. I feel indescribably ashamed and disgusted by my facial hair, in particular. I have a lot of it, and it’s thick and dark, and I have to shave my chin on a daily basis. And I don’t even feel like I can talk to anyone about it because I’m a woman who isn’t supposed to have this problem, and it makes me feel ugly and unloveable. I want nothing more than to fork over the hundreds of dollars that I don’t have for laser hair removal or something, but then I feel guilty for wanting to change my natural body for the sole purpose of improving my appearance based on societal expectations. But hey, what I took from this video was that I’m allowed to want to be happy about my appearance. So maybe I will do it, for own sanity."
"Being transmasc didn't even save me from feminine beauty ideas. I feel so much pressure to try and be a beautiful woman and it feels terrible to have messed it up with a masc hair cut and men's clothes that don't fit me."
"when i first saw your vids, i didnt even know you were trans"
"Archaeologists 500,000 years from now will clock you by the width of your pelvic brim, fortunately by then modern standards of beauty will have faded into the annals of history."

"My style is intentionally wearing nice clothing as badly as possible."
"You're a beautiful old fart. Lol ;-)"
"Just finished this video while binge-watching your channel since yesterday (when I first heard about it), and damn, you are so good! While watching the Jordan Peterson one I thought to myself how you are beautiful, thought about commenting that, but soon realized that this willingness to comment about your beauty, given that I had never before commented on any other female internet influencer's, would be motivated by the possibility that, subconsciously, I may think that as a heterosexual cis male I might want to manifest the approval of your beauty and, by imagining you would take offense or not give a shit, gave up commenting. However, after this video, knowing about your struggles with self image and beauty, and realizing that the Jordan Peterson one was way before your surgeries, I want to say that you were and still are beautiful. Of course you look more feminine according to societal standards, but your true beauty was definitely kept the same."
"You're my hero and saved me from a dark place in my life. Never stop making content please."

"You are *for realsies* so beautiful in so many ways and you have nothing to worry about in that department. Also, toner corrects your skin’s ph after cleansing 💜💜"
"Be Happy. Smile, you have beautiful teeth and your mouth is perfect. Once you feel joy inside, your inner beauty will come to the surface. You may then look into your mirror and see it for yourself."
"Is it wrong to actually not care about how you look (mostly)? And not in a not-like-other-girls way? I just don’t want to look dirty, and to wear things I like. Jewelry and makeup make me itch. I don’t look at my face for long enough to care about my pores or whatever shit my skin is made of. I just like my hair neat and tidy.   This lesbian is chillin’. Mostly. Because my mother constantly gets on my ass about my flat short hair and giant, filled pores. My entire family tells me to grow out my hair if I hate hair product so much.   And yet I don’t even want to present masculine or androgynous. I have big boobs and hips (and fat), I already look like a girl in my cis girl body. I don’t feel the need to present extra femme.   But I always hear “you can’t get a job looking like that” and “why won’t you just try to wear jewelry/makeup/hair product.” “Your haircut looks like a boy’s.” “Would you care about what your future possible girlfriend looks like?” (Yes, hypocritically of me, but that’s a whole different topic.)  Even when I have had makeup put on me, it feels wrong. Not because it’s feminine or anything, just because it isn’t me. It’s my mom, or my friend, or whoever looking back at me when I’m in makeup. When I’m wearing jewelry, it’s for them to know I’m wearing their gift, not because I like jangly shiny things on my person.  I really appreciate your take on this as someone who doesn’t feel like I fit in a “correct” female presentation a lot of the time, with a cis female body, (especially as a lesbian, who always get put in boxes of butch or femme) because of some of the things you talk about.   I guess I need to work on finding MY style. Thanks."
"Oh man i fucking died at the “if all men died tomorrow (F)”"
"I was SO with this since the SOPHIE at the beginning"
"I feel like beauty is subjective to an extent, because everyone has different beauty standards. At the same time, the whole of society can determine whether someone is ugly or not. I think ugliness is sort of an objective measure while relative beauty is much more complicated."
"I am trying to be an artist and currently, I'm best at drawing the face. In my head, I put people into 2 boxes. one with traditional beauty and the other with small,  some times big imperfections that fit a certain aesthetic. for example, a painting of my grandma eating watermelon in her garden is aesthetic but you won't see her running a runway anytime soon. There will always be someone who finds you attractive, sexual or not."

"You are so pretty"
"Here’s the thing, I have never seen a video of yours and I just barely watched your videos today. I am a hardcore supporter of Blaire and I first saw you on the debate you had with her. Still love her but I can genuinely say that you are a very beautiful person even if I disagree with you on a lot of things. You have a really pretty face. And you are hilarious. New sub. Maybe I just gravitated to you cause I’m a Gemini. Idk bye."
"I don't know how many people caught your 'Fear and Loathing' reference ('when you get hooked into a serious....') but I did and I am loving your channel so much."
"Her videos were just algorithm'd to me, & I have to say that the when I saw her, I thought she was born female until she told me otherwise. So pretty."
"16:59 never related so hard (im cis)"

"This is the first video I've watched of counterpoints. Already subscribed. Thanks for existing!"
"You're fine. Even cis women like myself can feel unattractive/masculine, especially when I have some hormone imbalances. But over time, I realized I'm perfect where I am. Just shine your light of inner love for how amazing you are - that's when other people will see your beauty. Sometimes we see makeup as a way towards having those feelings. I used to wear makeup, but I found that cleaning my face and applying simple natural lotions or aloe was more my vibe.  Shine your inner light."
"This is my new favorite youtuber holy fuck I'm so entertained and educated"

"So... I am on the (minority?) group that truly, honestly doesn't care about appearance enough to wear make-up. (Does that make me a lesbian?) OK...So. I wanted to tell you this. I am a 34 year old and I never used makeup - except for a wedding or two and when a few parties in my adolescence when my mother wouldn't let me get out if I didn't wear the few layers of whatever... True story. I think I can count the times I wore lipstick with one hand. Again, 34 years of my life (minus 10 when I was too young to?). And I just wanted to say, the reason I don't wear it... is because not wearing makeup makes me feel free.  Oh how I hungered for freedom from pointless worries too... I literally felt harrassed, watched, judged, stared at, unable to see myself in the mirror and not see the flaws, for all my childhood and part of my damn adolescence. I was under a lot of stress caring about those things WHILE trying to care about other (honestly more important, like trying to make the world a bit less shitty) things at the same time. I was miserable and, again, oh so stressed. The social imposition of 'caring' about how I look was unbearable.  Then I realized... if I stopped trying to hide my 'defects', I simply didn't care, a weight was lifted from me. That's not to say I don't care about physical appearance, far from it. Physically speaking, I need to like me... but I honest to god feel like I have an easier time doing that if I stop trying to look for flaws to correct/hide. Because if I had to hide one flaw, I had to hide all. And we all know we are going to find another and another thing, obsessively and fuelled by all the insecurity that will always fixiate on something and is never going to go away. Honestly, less time-consuming and productive - and healthy! - to just stop. Oh how I hungered for freedom from pointless worries too...Hey, btw. It did help the whole idea that 'people liking me just for my appearance would lead to a lot of heartache, so I might as well be natural and appreaciate the people who stick around despite it'. The 'appearance doesn't matter' stitch(?), mock all you want but, it is kind of the utter, ultimate TRUTH and savior to me. And something else. At some point, I started to really love my physical appearance. I honestly love how I look, even though my face and body has all the same flaws as before and more. I have affection for this appearance. (I'd hit that... I think I'm kind of a bonafide narcisist.) I see that's not your experience but, I recommend it if all possible. To me, it was breaking the chains of social imposition and self-harrassment. And I could use that mind-burnout for other, better things.   As for validations from others? I got a secret. It's not them being liars: they literally don't care. Everybody cares more about their own personal appearance than how others look to them. Knowing that was liberating too for me, because it looked I could finally stop caring about how I looked to them. (I stopped waxing my legs and walked around trying to see how many people would even notice... even to this day it makes me smile like crazy.)  And I don't want to be cruel, but I associated your old face with your ideas, the experience of watching you all these years, and I kind of miss that face now. Sure, you look prettier now, but affectionately speaking, I grew fond of the other version of you a lot. And that's how beauty is perceived too. Sometimes, it's association and getting used to seeing a face. I'm sure I'll grow to associate those ideas with the new face too but... yeah, I never thought you looked anything but 'I'd hit that' attractive."
"how to fall in love over and over again forever for the same woman. and still not feel hurt."
"Well, this is the first video of yours I've watched (I've seen some reccomended but this is the one I opted to try out for some reason) Honestly I was a bit confused at first about the surgical procedures you listed because I assumed you were a cisgender woman so I was surprised you were trans. So yeah, I  think you're beautiful. I'm not a makeup wearing girlie girl, and that skin care regimen is frankly terrifying but your entire personality is fascinating so I'm going to go binge watch all your other videos now."

"Is it Strange hearing Natalie doubts herself, makes me feel better about myself 🤔? I'm a cis woman who is occasionally misgendered (which is annoying) and I really don't Try often. I'll go out in sweats and a graphic t most days if I can, I'm also Black so beauty standards 😁. But like, Natalie is Conventional, U.S. Hawt and 'beat' (?). So to hear her Doubt makes me Happy? Thanks for attending my Ted talk."
"Even Before the surgery, you could Def pass"
"All this surgery sounds Scary af 😭"
"Thought you looked a bit different"
"Hey so, not looking for hate> not spouting it either. Just, there are other people with areas in their life that match the feelings of body dysphoria just it has nothing to do with gender. For me my area is the way I was raised. It does not matter how I am now, how I was raised shaped my body. There's nothing I can do about it short of living my life in a small box shaped by other people.  This, to me, is what makes this transition acceptance a love hate relationship. I LOVE that people are being recognized for who they are and can live their best selves.. I dislike that it is something treated like a coveted item [yes there are life quality requirements needing to be lacking> but that is it]> Can we move on and forget those who refuse to pull their heads from their asses> Time's up across the board."

"I don’t wear makeup, but it isn’t some “smart grad student thing.” Personally, it’s just because I’m too lazy to wake up 20 minutes early to TRY to fix my face, (with no natural talent at it.) Although, honestly, it doesn’t hurt that as a bi girl I’m trying to appeal to the lesbian demographic anyways."

"Asians literally bleach they skin to look acceptable and have plastic surgery to get anywhere. And its not even just woman. Its literally EVERYONE. Its very different from US where you have actually few number of people turning to surgery. Honestly, I do not care who wants to be what gender and who does what surgery. The only thing I personally care about is, how Asians can afford it???? While I need to save up for months... :I btw my bro works for Hankook tire - Korean company - and 100% confirmed that double eyelid is not even considered as plastic surgery for them anymore... its actually a statement of classiness."
"I'm sorry. You can shove me into whatever gender box you want for your stereotyping. You can shove me into any box. Anything you need.  Okay, so edit: you talked about people lying especially fans and stepping on throats right as I posted this. But really though. Choke me please."

"I am a cis woman who has body dysmorphia, and sometimes I feel like my face has this weird 'manliness' to it in bad angles and lighting.  Sometimes I look like 👱🏻‍♀️ and sometimes I look like 🗿.  It's like I'm a shapeshifter.  I think this feeling definitely comes from me trying to follow beauty standards, I wanna look 'soft and dainty' instead of 'harsh and rough'."

"As someone whose never felt attractive their entire life, I’m subbing to you cos of this video alone."
"Natalie, i just wanna say that i love your video and I also use your videos for therapeutic background music, i love the way you talk"
"Your statement on why surgery doesn't fix body dysmorphia (essentially) reminds me of the conversation around romantic relationships. You can't get into a relationship expecting the other person to make you feel better about yourself, just like you can't rely on the validation of others to feel beautiful. You have to change your own mentality, learn to love yourself, etc. Even if a thousand people a day tell you how amazing you are, your mind will start to rationalize that those people are lying. It's amazing how many things in life come back to positive self-worth.   ALSO, I desperately want the confidence (and patience) to wear your eyeshadow, because damn, girl, you are gorgeous. I hope you take a moment today to internalize that."
"You touched on the concept of desire a little bit in this post. I would love to see you dive deeper into that! By the way, you look v babely and I hope you're not too hard on yourself! IMO you don't need any more work, not that my opinion matters but your femininity speaks for itself at this point. Either way, society needs critical thinking like yours regardless of how great you look (which is great) ;)"
"And cancel culture needs to die unless someone is truly a horrible person. Someone saying mean things isn't a 'phobe' it's just people saying words. I can say you have a man vain in your neck but that don't make me a homophobe it just means I'm saying ridiculous things. Bottom line is you have to except yourself and fuck the haters because they'll always be there."
"What is your background? Do you have a psychology degree? I saw your latest video and it was very well done and if these younger sjw types would take a page from your book we'd all get along. It's just the constant whining and complaining, not to mention the 'inclusive' sjw's beating a gay asian man takes points away from that side. If we all just talked like regular people and had a sense of humor most of us would get along. There will always be hateful shitty people and that's just reality but these assholes are acting like they are changing the world when you can't change the people set in their ways. Tell all to chill the fuck out, and let the 60-70% of us normal people get along and the other 30-40% of the world will live in misery hating things they don't understand. You can't change everyone so instead of fighting everything just get along with everyone that will except you. I don't know, I'm rambling but I hate this new generation of cry babies. I hung out with many gay dudes/girls and I called them fags and queens and they loved it and they would call me a straight ape and we'd all have a laugh. I hope you can get through to this new generation because they need help."
"is that kingdom hearts"
"I was watching this on my TV and I had to pull out my phone specifically to write this comment. 1) You, without your makeup, are 100% organic beauty, and I don't mean that in the empty, mushy platitude way, I mean it literally. Your face shape reminds me of three influential women in my life, My Mother, My Older Sister, and my Elementary school Montessori Teacher. I could totally see you, without your makeup or with light makeup, carting your kids to school in your minivan, dressed in a T-shirt, sports bra, and an ankle length hippie skirt, full length leg-hairs, and unquestionable, rock-solid feminity. I could see you strolling through Wal-Mart, chatting with your sister on the phone as you shop for breakfast cereals, completely unclockable by the average Wal-Mart goer. I don't know if it's just because I'm from the Deep South and we just don't have the same high-level/movie-star beauty standards of  big-city folk, but I totally can't see a trace of overt masculinity in you that isn't present in at least 30% of Cis women. If anybody were to stare at you down here, it would probably be due to your beauty (You're like a Deep South 8.5/9 without makeup, 10 with the makeup you have on in this video), or due to your Cardi-B nails (which are uncommon on the average southern white woman, and would turn a few heads).   2) We all go through a stage in our womanhood (for Cis women it's sometime between Middle school and that first bout of early/mid-twenties weight gain or first time motherhood) where we basically hit rock bottom with our self image, and have to build up a new and better image of feminine beauty that includes all of those gigantic pores, and the stretch marks, and the raccoon makeup of infant-influenced sleep deprivation. It's the stage where we learn to accept ourselves as who we are, not as who society tells us to be. It's that stage where we stop playing dressup with mommy's makeup and heels, and we emerge from our girlish past preconceptions of feminine beauty as beautiful grownass butterfly women who decide for themselves what beauty looks like. I guess for Trans Women, that stage can be way more elusive, so I want to give you some pearls of wisdom. A) most women, especially Cis women, pretty much have that one day out of any given month where they feel totally beautiful, and then it's abruptly followed by PMS and a cycle that makes us feel like dirty trash hobos, so if anything, that feeling just confirms your womanhood.  B) You've done it. You've become a woman. But right now, you're just a low level baby Woman, you have to build up the powerlevel of a high-tier sagemistress. Quick leveling tips: Read a lot of Mommy Blogs. Consider  Motherhood (actual motherhood isn't required, but as a woman you should almost always feel pressured to become one. Idk if you have an elder woman in your life pressuring you to have children like most Cis women do, so I'll stand in). Question your ability to mother (we all do). Come to the conclusion that no matter what kind of a mom you might turn out to be, your womanhood is valid.  Watch the Netflix show Tuca and Bertie. Contemplate sisterhood. Basically consume media made by women for women. The idea is to build a picture of womanhood from the average Woman's perspective, not the image of womanhood that corporations want to sell you. This ultimately will make you feel more 'part of the club' 3) This has been pretty wild and rambley, but I hope you get that the gist of what I'm trying to say is that to feel more like a woman, I suggest that you try to stop thinking and consuming media like a man who is trying to become a woman, and more like a woman who simply trying to be the best woman she can be. Either way, you're already Mom/Sister/Lady material in my book."
"This might get swallowed in the proverbial torrent of comments... But I find you beautiful. Your mind moreso."
"I know insecurity can be a bi*ch, but just wanted to say for what it's worth, you are an absolutely gorgeous woman, and deserve to feel pretty all the time. ❤️"
"I agree with the comment about style!"
"I've always held the idea that most women wear make-up because they feel insecure about their looks. Not necessarily to men, but to other women. Girls are fucking vicious to one another. You look off for one day and you are called a garbage dump and disgusting. I think make-up's kind of like a drug? Like a psychological drug. Like shoes, or clothes, some girls go all for it and dress stupid pretty and throw on camp make-up and the whole shebang; because it makes them *feel* pretty? Maybe cause it's feminine, maybe because of society? In the end, I've never met a man that actually wanted a girl to wear make-up. It's like a:' Eh, whatever.' kind of thing (in my experience, of course) Too much make-up though, to most, looks really bad. 'fake.' And girls call it that because we know how shallow and insecure we all are we just don't admit it, not to ourselves, nor to others.  I like to think about it like Nutmeg on a desert. The Nutmeg is meant to be a little treat, a little extra special something. It's supposed to take you five minutes. But instead, you throw on 3kg and move it around and paint the poor desert with it to make it look like a queen and then it looks like 90% powder. AKA; bad, fake, powdery, too much blah blah blah whatever you want to call it. Obviously some people like that, and that's fine (however bad it is for your skin) If you like wearing a lot of make-up for a lot of the time then go right ahead.  I just think, instead of wearing it for fun, for a little extra zest, women are wearing make-up because they feel ugly without it. Both because of marketing, other women, and the belief that it will make men think you're prettier. (Which is debatable, but I'm not a man, so I wouldn't know.)    Though I think we can all agree, marketing went ape shit on make-up. Holy damn."
"BURGEONING😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
"Just look at contrapoints😂"
"The pain was MEMORABLE😂"
"Also, when you talk about the whole 'What do we next?' question. I think for me what has been most helpful in building up new conceptions of beauty is just being around other trans women and pushing past the urge to criticize them. I'm a lesbian and I probably fit in more with your description of grad students even though I'm a drop out.  I think makeup's awesome for some people, it just isn't a thing I've done.   But yeah idk I think if you have an open mind and heart around other trans women you can see the myriad ways people can be beautiful outside of beauty standards. Also, before tumblr canceled the nipple, I would see all kinds of drawings and selfies that just made myself more comfortable with seeing the different ways for women to be beautiful."
"This is my first video of you and I'm completally head over heals in love"
"I've always believed that most of my dysphoria comes directly from the violence I've faced and times that people have made me hate my body. Like when I'm thinking transmisogynist stuff about myself, that doesn't come from nowhere. I believe it often comes from times when I didn't pass and something bad happened. And to make matters worse, after all of these bad experiences, I would typically take home the lesson (with some encouragement from the outside world) that it was all the fault of some part of my body."
"SOPHIE at the beginning though"
"Omg riley denis u cleaned up"
"Jesus, it really was just a few millimeters os bone and tissue here and there. And it was still incredibly effective. If more people could access that kind of procedure... I can't promise an utopia but it might help a lot."

"SOPHIEEEEEEEEE"
"Also, I think a lot of people should look towards VR for body images cause honestly being in a humanoid form in general is pretty boring."

"She ALMOST pronounced Van Gogh correctly! I am very impressed"
"Natalie is so beautiful and inspiring. I’m staying in on the fourth to binge watch her videos because I can’t stand human interaction today"
"I'm a trans guy with a raging dad instinct over a bby trans girl starting to really figure herself out but I've always felt like I can only really give her half the picture when it comes to this whole 'what are gender' thing. The other self appointed 'parent' is genderqueer and we dont really know any trans women, I might direct her to your videos. I like how deep you go on these really hard subjects that I think have kept us all up at night some time or another but you dont always have a fully fleshed out answer at the end, because I think the answer to a lot of these questions is often really individual, but at least now we have more information to help us find it."
"God the intro to this video will always be the coolest shit"
"can confirm as a lesbian who is just straight chillin' 😎"
"wow"
"you look almost exsctly like an old family friend named mandy...which is...now that i type...not a pun i promise, you resemble her so much i havent thought about her in years until now"
"The results look lovely. You look Like yourself yet still new and more feminine than ever. It’s really amazing what a few millimeters of bone make 🧐"
"CIS woman. What i take from this is that use make up to suit me. I'm not able to do that flicky thing at the corner of mu eyes. Fuck it. Embrace it.  I need to find make up that doesn't make me look like I've pancaked it on.    Om a 48 educated woman. I feel like I should really know this by now."
"You get facial surgery for yourself to look more feminine? Yet u shame Incels?"
"I have never not related to something more in my life haha"
"You’re gorgeous. I am a tad intimidated by how smart and pretty you are lol."
"I'm a gay man and I agree. I feel pressured to be smart and above such things. However, I do face exercises for wrinkles every other day or so (called face yoga)"
"not trying to be mean but trying to understand. I never understood the idea of 'Gender is a social construct but let me get surgery to look like the other sex to use makeup and wear womens clothing'  what  is 'feeling like a woman trapped in a mans body' even feel like. if gender is a construct based on roles and societal rules, why alter your sex and physical attributes to look like the other sex. How would you know what it is like to feel like the other sex? unless feeling like a woman means that you feel like you should be playing female gender roles. But then, Just because you feel like you prefer the other gender role in the construct,(ie feminine demenor, clothing, makeup and hair) doesn't mean you are naturally a female and should therefore get life changing and permanent surgery.   Im really trying to understand transgender side of story if anybody would like to help me out.  It is extremely confusing on how somebody who prefers the opposite gender construct would conclude that they feel like a biological woman and therefore surgery is necessary. i get going up to cross dressing and demenor but jumping from there to surgery is bizzare.  Im a pretty liberal guy but this line of thinking is hard to rationalize."
"I watched your old videos and I can honestly say that u turned me on post op"

"*do you want your face to be UNTONED?* 🤣🤣😭"
"Contra, I struggle a fuck ton with my body image. I developed an eating disorder over five years ago and I still continue to struggle with it a lot more than I care to admit sometimes. This and your previous video really resonated with the experiences that having an ED has brought. It's painful, lonely, scary, and downright disgusting at times, but there's still something about it that I can laugh at. It's funny that I've gone into a public restroom to purge only to be mistaken for a teenage boy because of my lack of tits. I've met a lot of great people from my times in	 mental --- erm, behavioral hospitals. I've gone through shit and yet I continue to grow as a person. When dumbass dipshit insults me or insists I'm some kind of snowflake, I can stand with my head held high because I know I have fucking style.  You'll help to lead the unique band of weirdos to knowing that they, in spite of the shit situations they've been dealt, can develop style in this dying world too. Thank you."

"Regarding makeup: I think the assumption that people, or animals, will stop doing something that they are biologically programmed to do just because a specific stimulus is not present, is flawed. The whole point of something being driven by evolution is that it's innate and instinctual, which means that it will come out on it's own, even if there isn't an appropriate stimulus that needs responding to."
"I want plastic surgery now"
"Is it possible to make ones voice seem more authentically feminine?"

"'I don't want to be Contrapoints anymore, I want to be Gigi Gorgeous.'  Well, for what it's worth, if this channel wasn't... this, then I probably wouldn't be watching. Maybe that's just another symptom of our society being in need of a Contrapoints, but regardless, I'm very thankful that you do what you do and you are whomst you are.  As a sidenote, that was some pretty interesting Erik Satie at the end. Props to Zoë."
"Your outfit is amazing!! Where do you find something like that?"
"I'd say your current pre makeup look is very academic lady avoiding makeup on purpose Like a messy ponytail would seriously finish the look"
"following you for some years now, always been interested in how you dealt with your transition. it's obvious that you see yourself as a person first (i get that perspective, for example the gender neutral attachment theory helped me with my BPD a lot) and your effective  and successful transitioning as a byproduct of your general development, with an integrated self being the ultimate indicator of success. now having said that. I honestly think you've become quite hot, both in a sexy but also interpersonal kinda way. and this is coming from just a dude who is just okay with his dick (but maybe not with his manboobs, definitely will get surgery at some point). I put this comment about me thinking you are hot to a somewhat open dude on purpose here on this video, with the hope you can feel like 'hey, my personality is well rounded, the body thing seems to pay off, the pieces are starting to fit AND I am getting outward validation'. I will apologize though, if I'm being unawarely self-important here"
"Fun story, I cosplay as Jessica Rabbit, and I'm also in university to become a biology teacher, in hopes to extend that to becoming a Professor. While in cosplay I got in a discussion about philosophy and this man just couldnt seem to believe that a physically attractive woman was also educated. At some point in the conversation it was all he would talk about, and very much turned me off of the conversation in general.  There's such a stupid idea that beauty and brains cant exist in the same person, very possibly connecting to the concept of looking more androgynous or masculine to be taken seriously."
"why am i here? how did i get here? what is life? what is reality, it doesnt exist it never has.......I....."
"im sorry but did you mention the name of my favorite scotsman? John Maclean? the immortal? have my two worlds collided in perfect harmony?"
"Personally, I believe women wear makeup to impress other women and to compete for attention. It makes sense to think that the women in the prison are so insecure about how they look, they would go at such lengths to gain access to makeup. To wear it for other women, for other people. It's pretty undeniable that with makeup you make yourself more conventionally attractive, you draw in more symmetrical browns, you make your eyes appear bigger, make your lips look pouty, give your cheeks a rosy healthy glow. That's to be perceived beautiful by other people AND yourself. When you're wearing the makeup, you feel more confident, happier in your self and your outward appearance. It's still technically you, but its a slightly better version (depending on the amount of makeup) of you so It doesn't feel disingenuous to many girls."

"I love the electro Satie cover"
"You know, I've watched several of your videos and as a straight man, a CIS as you like to call us, I have to say I have never, ever met ANYONE who spoke so eloquently, so honestly, so confidently even in your insecurities and so funny with how you deliver your content. You are wrong about things, especially straight guys like me. Yeah, there are plenty of assholes out there that are scared of people like you...mostly because the more you look female, the easier it is for you to 'trick' them into 'doing gay things.' Of course I'm know you understand that idiot belief. But away from those spineless douchebags, there are plenty of straight guys like me who love what you're doing. Also, trans and cross-dressers aren't the only ones that like women's clothing. Personally speaking, I did some acting where I played a split-personality guy who's other half manifested as his sister. While I looked HORRIBLE in drag, I enjoyed it. Nylons are fucking wonderful against the skin. Wearing the skirt aired out my nuts which are almost always a little sweaty. It's not how I would want to dress normally, or even on weekends, but I can definitely see the appeal.   I do have to say that you are a very beautiful girl and you have an amazing personality.  I would feel awkward and uncomfortable because of my social brainwashing to be in a relationship with a trans person, (Yeah, that 'you're turning me gay' shit still has an echo in my white-privileged brain), but I would highly value a friendship with you, and I'm far from alone on this side of the gender fence. I pride myself on being scientifically well-versed, and I know we ALL start out female in the womb, and that a series of genetic triggers must be fired in perfect order to make a male. I get that in trans people, some of those triggers went off, others didn't. There's nothing wrong with you feeling like a girl inside. You ARE a girl inside. Looking at you as a female, you're prettier than most girls born female. I don't see any of the 'aging trans' you talk about. You're gorgeous, don't sell yourself short.  As much as you talk about how CIS guys are assholes, and rightly so, know that you have at least one straight guy on your side who, regardless of your sexual alignment, takes your side on the issue, understands the hell you face every day in a society that says 'you can be whatever you want to be' and then demonizes you for doing it and is doing what little they can to help end the torment LGBTQ people go through. Keep up with the videos,  you're so right on point and intelligent and pretty I'd feel terrible if you left. :)"

"Natalie, i have to know where i can get that sequin top. Ive been thinking about it for weeks."
"Sorry it took me so long to watch the video, and I know there is no chance this comment is seen, but I want to thank you for the great video. I also hope you feel better about yourself, and apologise if you are feeling pressured by meeting some sort of external expectations to be 'the internet's Contrapoints'. I know that people are complicated creatures, but I hope that you feel confident to present yourself to us, the fans, any way that makes you happy.  Not that I communicated any of that overzealous treating you like a dominating queen, but I admit searching for memes along the lines. And being the person to think of makeup as not needed, kind of dismissive perhaps, while being in the not make someone feel bad but trying to be honest too, it feels like I have been given something to think about. Regardless, I think you look cute either way, but you also rock the beauty stuff. Your effort shows.  Sorry if I said anything offensive."
"I never even noticed you were trans until you said so"
"Incel: has a septic tank for a personality, convinced that  browridge is the problem"
"You know, aS a TrAnS pErSoN (couldn't pass up the opportunity), I find that I often have a hard time clocking people. I mean, fuck, I live under a rock and so the first time I stumbled upon a Nikita Dragun video, I didn't even consider that she might be trans... until I found a video in which she talked abo it being clocked, and at that point I was like I'M SORRY WHAT HOW?? I HADN'T THE SLIGHTEST INCLINATION I RLLY THOUGHT U WERE CIS?? Ah if only it were that easy for nb folks such as myself :v"
"I agree with a lot of the points made, but I disagree that women in male dominated fields that don't wear makeup are doing it because of pressure to be masculine (or that it's a weird flex). As someone in that situation, in a day to day basis I'm trying to keep up with my peers, and beauty to the extent of wearing a face full of makeup everyday is just not in my priorities because of that. Most of the women I know that wear makeup even admit that they do it more for themselves and other women than for men, so working around all men doesn't create the same desire for makeup for a lot of women."
"Thank you for the ASMR, goddess ContraPoints"
"I just got to the part where you mention that reddit comment that really hurt you. Well, for what it's worth, Beauty is only my 2nd video of yours, the first was Darkness, and when watching it it hadn't even occurred to me that you are trans until you brought it up in the video. That's all I really have to say about it, just please keep being awesome."
"amen"
"I think you are beautiful inside and out, and I am so happy I found your channel. I'm not trans, but learning from you is a pleasure, and your elegant approach to addressing complex issues fills me with admiration for your many skills. You are clearly a unique, wonderful person, and I'm glad you threw your voice into the fray of YouTube <3"
"You should make an ASMR video.  PS: That skull-tapping is always very ASMRish as well. <3"

"I don't think I've seen you without makeup since the old videos that I don't watch anymore (secondhand dysphoria lol) but... you look like Lady Gaga? her without makeup as well obvs"
"I just wanna talk about the part where you address women who don't wear makeup. As someone who falls, intentionally, into this group, you didn't address another possibility. Personally, I do not subscribe to the belief that I have to wear makeup to be beautiful. I feel that makeup is a side effect of  society that does not accept women for who they are without tweaking, changing, or enhancing them. I absolutely am not in the Becky category, and do not think makeup is frivolous or unacceptable. Wanting to be more beautiful is a biological need related to the desire to reproduce (ignoring all the social reasons we might want to makeup), and I would never shame another person for wanting to use it. But it's just not for me. I don't think I need to augment my body to be beautiful, and I believe that MY truest beauty is a completely natural one. But I don't shame other women for wearing makeup, and I think it's a great tool for fun, for comfort, for getting that good ole sexytime. I understand this wasn't the point of this video, I just had to share my experience because I like to hear myself talk"
"Revealing my cultural ignorance: What’s the track playing at 14:20?"
"‘My nose was busted THE HOUSE’ 😂😂😂"
"You Are Pretty. I wish I could do makeup like you, but I was scared by high school bitches telling me all colors make me look like a whore, and I should only rock a shades of brown smokey eye.  Also apparently my state is the secret anti-females at work capital of the former US and my inability to get a job might be that I can't afford makeup or a gym membership....or healthy food but thats beside the point, at least for work.  I do face painting though. Like Cheek and Body Art. Made like $70.00 at Pride this year. (Non-binary, Universally/ Demi sexual, Aspiring King.)   Oh and I heroically saved a drunk dude from possible alcohol related death, by putting him in my wagon, and with the help of his friend ( she kept him from drowning in his barf,) biked him to a main street so that the Uber could pick them up and get him help.  But if you were around here I'd ask you out for a Bubble Tea. *Sweeps Heroic Cape and offers you a Princely Bow and a Sunset Rose*"

"Hey Natalie, I'm a trans gal planning on having ffs soon. If I may ask, I was wondering how you went about choosing a surgeon. I have one in mind, but I'm still nervous about whether or not I'm making the right choice. I know I want the surgery, but I'm just so anxious about buying something I'll be stuck with for life without seeing what I'm getting first. I'd really appreciate any advice on the matter."
"20:36 I ACTUALLY DIED This was me a year ago at 24 trying a face mask like who has time for self care???"
"Being a fat  teen trans guy I've had a complicated relationship with beauty and I love this video for putting it into a way that makes me understand it better. Thank u!"
"You just came up on my home page, but I'm here a few minutes into your video and I appreciate you and am glad to be here. Have a great day :)"
"honestly you've inspired me to think about therapy again   I thought getting into a fulfilling, sexual relationship would finally make me feel good about my body. I got the relationship: the body acceptance is less than forthcoming. I hate the way I look - I always have - and it's time I confront it. Or, at least, acknowledge that I have a problem with the way that I think about myself.   Much love to you, Contra.   (p.s. love the make-up today, purple and blue is gorgeous hennny)"

"I'm worried that me being so interested (the process, what people go through mentally) in this makes me a bad person. Like if I asked my uber driver some of these questions would violate their privacy. But you share it with me. I don't know"
"My boyfriend has been trying to get me to watch your vids for like 6+ months. This is the first video I've watched. I'm not (yet) a fan so you can believe me when I say you're HOT.   I'm a transracial adoptee (brown, adopted and raised by middle-class white racially un-woke Aussie parents).  For me beauty helps me reduce the label of 'other'.  Adopting western norms and beauty standards to avoid othering is (sadly) the safest, most comfortable and authentic way for me to live. If I don't wear make-up I get treated differently. I got chased out of sephora by security once to have my bag checked on a no-makeup day. Mate I wouldn't fucking be in here if this exact shit didn't happen when I don't wear makeup! Good sales tactic, scare the ugly brown people.   Internally, I'm not Sri Lankan. I don't identify with the country, people or culture in any way... but according to society I'm not entirely Australian so I need to look the part as much as possible."

Your videos are fun as hell to watch and i cant wait to watch more of em :)"

"20:07 Do you remember Patrick Batemans routine? That clip of her beauty routine certainly brought back the image for me. It seems to me that transpeople are obsessed with their appearance, trying to 'pass' as whatever gender they chose, must be difficult and in a lot of cases also expensive to get all these beauty products and  plastic surgery.      Patrick Bateman was also obsessed with his appearance and he also wanted to 'pass' as someone, a identity based on superficial features, a constructed persona....   Whatever, thats not my problem to think about. Its so easy being a dude :D damn its nice to be in tune with who and what you are."
"That's quite a skin care routine. I just own a bottle of face wash. I don't use it, just own it."

"I really thought the intro music voice was Lindsay Ellis"
"Beauty is something i've always struggled with. Even before I came out to myself as nB, my parents verbally and physically abused me and justified it by saying that I wasn't worth anything because I was/am ugly. I'm dark skinned, masculine (I'm AFAB), and fat. My parents would promise me money if I didn't eat. There are still plenty of days where I lie in bed hating the way i look, like today. I wish I could just pretend I didn't have a body and that I didn't look a certain way, but it always comes back to hurt me with the inner voice in my head. Urgh. This video hits so close to home."

"I've never had a video introduction get stuck in my head so much. Loved this video, and thanks for ~sHaRiNg YoUr jOuRneY~"
"Natalie's imagery before is just as beautiful as her after.  Personally, I prefer her nose before, because I love sharp features on a lady rather than soft.  Glorious either way.  The work is well done in that Natalie still looks like Natalie.  And holy smokes, all that soul!  Brilliant woman, glowing from the inside out."
"I dunno man, I kind of see it as 'I can spend 2 hours of my day making myself look 'perfect' and 'pleasurable to myself' or like an artsy moving statue... or I can go learn a skill that actually bears weight in ways other than how I add aesthetic to the room I'm in while to the point I can't touch my face.' Personally, the worlds where etiquette and aesthetic matter are so very, very small, they bear no weight, and everything's been done so many times it's like a pouring a drop in the ocean on collective consciousness and interpreting it as a tidal wave. Look behind the eyes, not at the facade.   I mean this in absolute support: you'll never surgery away the broad shoulders and manly hands, the collar bone or the hips, or the feet. The skull overlapping your face in the beginning kind of resonates with how an obsession with one's image often stems from an obsession with death and the concept of there being a statuesque perfect 'form' of ourselves we must strive to achieve (however conditioned that is by the age we live in - especially for women and other marginalized groups whose sense of identity are rarely allowed to be fully cultivated from within due to outside forces attempting to control that, as we are products of our environment to the degree that environment has power and presence over us - but also subconsciously and in the way we plan things given enough over-exposure).    Almost the whole beauty industry relies on cultivating the inner drives glorified in this video and just about all media, and that's not to take away from the side of it that genuinely restores people to who they should have the opportunity to be - like surgeons who save a kid's life from cleft lips or brings a burn victim's skin back to life, or take care of other severe deformations. I'm still on the fence about gender 'confirmation' surgery (mainly for minors, as there are more obvious issues there) but none of that will ever be my decision to make nor would I ever interfere with personal choices like that for people. However, I still caution that we must listen to and cultivate our spirits away from any and all influences or 'influencers' for as much time as we can, as the universe is a lot, LOT bigger than we can ever see from any one or handful of times and places (e.g. like those cultivated in these series of sounds and images), and so may be our callings. Our consciousness in one moment may be from a completely different place than in another moment, and we have to listen to all of it to know ourselves enough to make meaningful developmental changes to what's really going on behind our eyes in a way that makes our outward affects a lot more, well, meaningful and far-reaching. Pleasure principles are overrated, also, not that I'm some self-suffering edgelord, but I know a lifetime of pain would be worth it if it meant having the time to complete certain missions. Okay that's enough abstract emotion gibberish for one day."

"Natalie your so beautiful you have fan art. If I were a good painter I would paint but I'd have to be talented to show your beauty for what it is! Very honest video takes courage to lay your cards on the table like that so be proud of the sheer audacity and authentic beauty you posses. Have some dopamine youtube goddess... And hurry up I want to see another video!! Impatient mother fucker over here!!"
"Honestly when I first saw you in thumbnails I thought you were a biological woman, and even hearing about this video's topic from friends' discussions I never clocked that you were trans"
"I loved that you used Tchaikovsky's Arabian Dance (nown as the music of 'The Sexy Fishs' of Fantasia) in the soundtrack, i imagined you making the seven veils dance when it touches. You could interseccionate beauty padrons with the race relations, talking about stereotipes like 'white people as the pick of beauty, brown women sexualized for the eyes of white man, etc'."
"You are pretty <3"
"TBH I liked your face before, but then again I'm a straight female. I thought something looked off from the thumbnail, I'm surprised that it was a result of surgery. Your nose is more feminine than mine now, I'm both happy for you and jealous."
"Man you remind me of my sister when you aren't wearing makeup. Trippy"
"I'm sorry. When you said 'Maybe it's for the best' I immediately said 'Maybe it's Maybelline'"
"I'm a lesbian but I'm also asexual. I'm not sure if asexuals can relate, but I have no desire to become beautiful. It's not really out of a wokeness, I just don't really understand what attractive is supposed to look like. I think without a desire to procreate or engage in sex, the standards of beauty become more mixed. that being said, I do love style and fashion and I like being a goth and wearing pink a lot.  I can empathize with the struggle of feeling worthless, it's insecurity rooted in beauty. I also feel like that insecurity is probably tenfold when you're living in a society where most people are transphobic and the rest are cis-people who only value trans people when they pass. And then the outliers who are woke or whatever. I feel like that experience is extremely gripping and almost feels hopeless. Insecurity is a tunnel you keep digging no matter how much you improve, you can only go deeper. That being said, i'm very bewildered by your claim that you have no style. wtf girl, you literally wear cool costumes and have unique over the top makeup. Of course you have style. I'm not just saying that for parasocial reasons. Objectively, you are stylish."
"CP, you're extremely Beautiful but please be sure to maintain your cellular regeneration my love. :-)  https://www.amazon.com/TRU-Nicotinamide-Riboside-Next-Level-Vegetarian/dp/B07LCFNBYT/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=tru%2Bniagen&qid=1561651489&s=gateway&sr=8-1-spons&smid=A1W0QC6JE0QLDF&th=1"
"I really like your point about style. I've been pretty active in the goth community for about four years now and I think this is something goths have known for a long time. There is a particular type of goth girl that the internet loves, but most actual goth women are not thin white tattooed women with long dark hair and big boobs. Most goth women are of average weight or bigger, some are curvy, some are not. Fat goth women are not uncommon, and you also get goth women who are very skinny. But none of that matters. Fatshaming within the community isn't so widespread because there is a greater emphasis on personal style, on the development of individual aesthetics, turning your makeup and outfit into art. The focus is on your expression, not your beauty."
"23 minutes in, are we allowed to say 'you are pretty!'.  I'm sure I've missed a tonne of points here. Perhaps I'm only allowed to _think_ someone is pretty. Pretty sure I'm not allowed to say anything to anyone, ever, because white male privilege et al. Also old and fat, so it would be like, 'what you look'n at me for!'  Would 'love the colours!' be too confrontational if we were both in a queue for a coffee?"
"For the record, you were beautiful before and you're beautiful now. Maybe it's hollow sounding coming from an internet rando, but you've never had anything to worry about. The changes are so subtle it's still easy to tell it's you, ya know? Your surgeon truly is an artist. 💖💖💖"
"10:43 why was that laugh the cutest thing ever"
"An aware poet, I would say. Subscribed. Loved the darkness video too. Looking forward to watching more soon."
"Buahahaha, the most powerful man in the world has declared war on your mentally ill fascism. We will no longer be silenced because you are sick and weak and your poor pathetic fee fees are hurt. No more safe spaces for you. This is only the BEGINNING!"
"I am not worthy. You are an amazing person, and I thank you, deeply, from my heart. I want you to know, that you are beautiful to me, before, after, any time. I hope that you can continue to inspire and provide this tangible inspiration to other trans folks, who need it. I know you helped me. Therefore, I want to help anyone I can. If anyone within the sound of my comment needs validation, I am here to give it. Thank you for your time."
"The only other video I have seen of you was the one where you were having a debate with Blair White. You seem so much more confident now. Also, you are absolutely drop-dead gorgeous. Thank you for being you and for eloquence and grace. Intelligent discourse is what brings about acceptance. Keep up the positivity and great work. 💘"
"Have you been taken in by the illuminati?"
"Somebody else pointed it out already but could you please put warnings up for people with epilepsy and photosensitivity"
"I know my opinion as a cis straight male don't matter much on this but you are beautiful Natty."
"@Contrapoints I'm a trans boy and when I transition I'm also getting my all my body hair lasered off. my beauty standard and desires come from supermodels and most don't have body hair. when I tell people most think it's weird cause somehow men=body hair but isn't that just a slippery slope to saying men are a collection of attributes you must obtain. hope your RNG is good."
"that opening cut was so cool!!"
"I'm so glad that I found your channel 💕"
"I always thought makeup is a woman's weapon against other women in the incessant bitch-war that's going on since the Cambrian (or earlier if you believe the paleontologists). But I also always thought cellulitis is some obscure Roman goddess, so I guess I'm ignorant. -_-'"
"what is happening"
"I am just a dumb cis. I am understanding more everyday how words can effect people."
""
"... I am sorry trans people.    I grew up brainwashed learning that crying and emotions were for women and f@gs..  You know, maybe if there was a way men could find the words or ways to express emotion, instead of....  this shit fucks you up... feelings are universal and.... Sigh... It's never going to happen."
"So when I see a trans women,, the truth is that when I see a trans women I think inside, wow! amazing! It is almost like a beautiful thing. Men have certain stigmas (I'm not even talking about racism), and seeing someone transcend these notions of masculinity, seeing them become actualized, It's a beautiful thing. I am genuinely happy for them. I feel jealous of how much courage and strength they have to show the world how they feel inside and who they are. I cant even watch a movie that is even remotely emotional because I am afraid I might get an urge to cry an shit during the beautiful moments. (I mean I'm learning, but it a process. I don't know what to say when someone is sad. I'll just try to distract you by describing to you a death ritual ceremony, a story about death and dying, or how different cultures have different philosophies when it comes to death... idk... I digress)"

"@ContraPoints  you can 'brush off the haters' but u will never  *brush off* never being a REAL WOMAN you sir will always be a man  even if u got a  man pussy now because our dna changes daily but not the kinda DNA  that would change a gender go look it up.  also go look up the suicide rates from trans people because  they got so FUCKING BRAINWASHED and they tried to convert back to normal and it was a harder life and welll they just  kill'ed themselves.  so fuck you"

"For those who *continue* to walk these wrong paths:  *Get to know Jesus. Now, while you are alive and perhaps have an opportunity. Truly get to know Him. For it is a certainty you will meet Him after this life is over.*  It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.  Hebrews 10:31 KJV  Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,  Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.  *And such were some of you:* but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.  All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.  1 Corinthians 6:9‭-‬12 KJV   It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God.  Hebrews 10:31 NLT  Don’t you realize that those who do wrong will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don’t fool yourselves. Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people—none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God. *Some of you were once like that.* But you were cleansed; you were made holy; you were made right with God by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. You say, “I am allowed to do anything”—but not everything is good for you. And even though “I am allowed to do anything,” I must not become a slave to anything.  1 Corinthians 6:9‭-‬12 NLT  It is a fearful and terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God [incurring His judgment and wrath].  Hebrews 10:31 AMP  Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate [by perversion], nor those who participate in homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers [whose words are used as weapons to abuse, insult, humiliate, intimidate, or slander], nor swindlers will inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God. *And such were some of you [before you believed].* But you were washed [by the atoning sacrifice of Christ], you were sanctified [set apart for God, and made holy], you were justified [declared free of guilt] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the [Holy] Spirit of our God [the source of the believer’s new life and changed behavior].  Everything is permissible for me, but not all things are beneficial. Everything is permissible for me, but I will not be enslaved by anything [and brought under its power, allowing it to control me].  1 CORINTHIANS 6:9‭-‬12 AMP"
"Because of youtube algorithm, I was trapped only in one point of view. It is nice to see well constructed different angle. I like the way you think, It brakes the stereotype of SJW etc. Anyway, it would be more than interesting if you could somehow make an interview with Jordan Peterson."
"Just read an article about you. I laughed so hard when I read the alt-right called you a pseudo-intellectual because before I had even gotten to that point in the article, I said the exact same thing to my friend when I read:  “She has criticized the euphemisms and coded hate speech of the alt-right and the moral failings of capitalism, describing the latter as a “repulsive juxtaposition of scarcity and abundance.’” That means nothing 😂😂 I don’t respect the alt-right but boy I do not respect you either.

Transspecies phobia..Do you have it ?"

"ContraPoints I’d love to support you on Patreon but I genuinely ask  At this point do you really need or want my Financial support?"
"I really don't think about my appearance much. My girlfriend doesn't wear make-up (I mean, really doesn't) and doesn't shave her legs, and that's fine with me. It definitely all used to matter a lot more to me when I was younger, though I was lucky to be brought up by parents who did challenge stereotypical thinking about beauty and very much prioritised personality. I also think my politics that have helped me relax about this sort of thing - I don't think we should be beauty obsessed, and so my feelings start to align with my thoughts. So... yeah, I found this video a bit hard to relate to, cos I personally just don't think about how beautiful I am very much. And I felt that wasn't really acknowledged as a valuable or even a genuine position. Should also say I am a cis white guy so have a lot of privilege around my appearance conforming to norms of beauty, which I recognise must inform my unfussed attitude."

"Hi Natalie! Sorry to bug you, but I'm a new fan and I just started binge watching all of your videos in order to stave off the darkness of adulthood now that I'm out of college (and because you're my favorite person on youtube). I just saw your old video on Psychiatry and I thought it was fascinating!! Would you be interested in revisiting the topic? I'd love to hear if you have the same opinion or if there are any additional nuances or perspectives you would want to consider 2 years on. :]"

"♥️🧨✨"
"Is contra thinking about how sexy she is or maybe she is constantly thinking about pikachu dancing?"
"I’m subscribed to you and YouTube is not ‘ringing the bell’ when your videos come out. It’s really starting to piss me off. Have you mirrored your videos on LBRY? It looks like it’s going to be the go to for everyone tiring from the YouTube algorithm/bias that’s crushing original content providers."

"New subscriber here. Just wanted to say your channel is so entertaining and informative, I'm impressed. And so professional. I also have those days when I look in the mirror and think it's all wrong, aging and bad. Then I remember that we see all the flaws, all of them, most people don't. And I remember that I'm loved and considered valuable, that I'm kind and intelligent... (Eww, gross!) And that this society, our media and culture is built on creating insecurity. Inadequacy. And desire to emulate celebrities. The world is just... Backwards.  And also I do what I can with makeup and accessories, it makes me feel good. It helps the outside align with my inside. I also loved the conclusion about style!  Yes, you're very pretty, I hope you realize this."
"I love Sophie.      Wait. I love you too. That was just a visceral reaction to hearing sophie at the beginning. I forgot to include my love for you."
"I guess this is a sort of problem (mainly psychological problems) that we develop living in this current socioe-conomic system.   It is as we mirror the fucked upness of the world around us with fucked upness inside us.  'Let me adjust myself to the world outside me, let me become mentally struggling human being...'"
"Make up is one of those things that humans do, even though it makes them uglier (I'm talking about cases in which an woman has beautiful face/skin, applies make up, and looks so much worse (I guess while thinking they look better?  Ehm, I'm confused, to be frank...))."

"Looking forward to your next video! Love your take on life/politics/bullshit and appreciate it so much and recognize, at the same time, the difficulty and the sheer will one must wrangle to call out such stuff. Not trying to rush you, but emphasizing how much your voice makes a real impact that mine cannot. I thirst for your content. -not going for creepy, probably coming off that way anyway. ... Hope you're well, Natalie. Please take care of yourself. You are a real gem and I greatly appreciate that you exist!"
"Commenting for the robots. This should reach 1 million views!"

"I love the references to her other videos 😄"
"Natalie, I have watched all of your videos several times.  Many, many times.  Like at least five times each, even the long ones about feminine wangs.  Why?  I think it's because you're just great at explaining difficult problems in a simple manner, all the while mixing the profound and the profane, keeping it funny.  You're like Neil DeGrasse Tyson, except your topics are the Alt-Wrong and trans rights instead of astrophysics and cosmology.  Keep being awesome :-)"

"I'm a cis woman and watching this suddenly reminded me that when I was a kid, I thought I would grow up and automatically turn beautiful.  like, that was part of becoming a woman.  it's demanded of you, so surely it would somehow be given to you.  nope, turns out it has to be painstakingly - not even created, but approximated.  and even the people who have it mostly don't feel like they have it."

"I think your personality is 100 on the out-of-10 scale. Would watch erry time"
"Style is just another standard to judge by. If you're bad at style in a post-beauty world, you may experience similar discrimination to what you experience for being ugly today. In contrast, if all styles are equally valid, then there is no value to style. Every paradigm we deconstruct is just another babushka doll in the paradox of existence."
"is that a man?"
"Masny kanał polecam."
"i wish i could get my points across concisely, but alas i am a wordy duck so here i go. Natalie, a trans friend of mine directed me to your videos after i posted a quote from Jordan 'Daddy' Peterson and it has been a boon upon my life. im a cis white male (i hate labels but i feel like saying that is relevant here) and your videos have been incredibly enlightening to me. i have struggled understanding trans people for awhile now. ive watched some friends transition and have had conversation with a few trans people to try and really understand what it is you guys go through. your page has really helped me do that. i had a funny thought the other day. so many rightists hate the gay and trans folks, but uphold the values of the west. it seems to me the foundations of western thought started in ancient greece with Plato. but any right leaning, trans hating types would fall into hysteria if they witnessed the hedonism and decadence of the ancient greeks haha. anyway, i just wanted to say thank you for laying out all your insecurities, i know thats a hard thing to do. and before you started talking about how all your fans flatter you and you arent sure if its true or not i was actually thinking to myself while looking at you, 'wow. I think i would fuck a trans chick.' XD so, in the off chance you read this i just want to say thank you for all that you do, and that you are beautiful and even though you have a lot of cynicism you are beautiful inside. fuck outer beauty. no, like literally, fuck outer beauty ;) i look forward to your next video.    Sincerely, Puk of the Wilds"

"Hello contrapoints. What is your opinion on antinatalism? /enviormental antinatalism. I want to have a a large family more than anyting. Is that wrong? Btw your brown area looked alot   alot like me(cisfemale never mistaken for a man) I did not know that part of me looked masculine. If I was so ritch I could have all the things I want  I would probably do the surgery now that I know it is a problem area. I know I am a bit worse than  avrage in looks but I did not know why."
"Cisgendered woman. Conservative. Catholic. Deeply agree."
"Oh my gosh. You will probably never see this, but you just put into words the exact conflict going on in my head every time I get ready to go somewhere, and it is SO nice to hear someone voice it in a way that doesn't just end with 'love yourself!' Wait, you mean it was that easy all along? Where are my ruby slippers?"
"You had me at 'Feral cat wandering through a liquor store'. Literally, like I felt you snatch my soul from the screen. I'm a cis woman living mostly inside of a pink bedroom with no photographs or paintings on my walls aside from a car-freshener hanging off my light. You would know nothing about me aside from 'likes cinnamon' if I took you home but I would add this video to the air freshener if nothing else."

"Hey, I just stumbled on to this video and I related to do much of what you were saying. I'm sure lots of people feel this way, but I never really hear them talk about it, especially as bluntly and openly as you did. Thank you so much for making me not feel so alone. You have a new sub."
"Just discovered you, love your videos and insights! :D  One quip with this one, though. As a woman who doesn't wear makeup, it's definitely not for the hipster meta reasons presented here about 'smart grad folks.'  As a kid first experiencing acne through puberty, putting on makeup simply made me feel worse about myself. It made me feel fake and like I couldn't be happy without depending on a thing I didn't even need before. So I stopped like the third day in. I liked makeup as a fun activity for dress-up or Halloween (as mentioned in the vid lol), but suddenly _needing_ it to go outside? Not a good feeling, not fun anymore.  Not saying experiencing middle school, high school, and college with acne scars and no makeup didn't feel absolutely awful either. But I don't know. In a way I feel like I learned to appreciate what I have more. I still have acne, scars, discoloration, and hirsutism now.. but I've found in a way experiencing what I did strengthened me. Probably not any more than the power and confidence makeup can give to others. But just a different perspective is my point, I guess. ^^  Also, vanity isn't inherently a bad thing! I can be real vain about my hair and clothes, lol Many days I spent 6 to 9 hours on my hair, yet I still have a perfect GPA and what not, as though being smart and pretty are mutually exclusive.  Welp, there's another tl;dr to add to my 'should be sleep' list."
"Your eyeshadow is amazing!"
"When SOPHIE started playing I almost screamed"
"25:13 Natalie, I see the homestuck track you slipped in there!"
"Coming back to comment on this again. I can totally agree with idea of cultivating a personal style. While I can never look like those pretty white teens on instagram, it might actually be better for me to cultivate my own fashion, hair, and makeup aesthetic that expresses the type of woman that I want to be. It's a lot more exciting than trying to force myself to look like something I physically cannot look like."

"Natalie, you're extremely intelligent and well read and share my distaste for  capitalism... So I trust you.   I don't know how else to request this, but I desperately want you to do a video on the potato famine/ Irish history of indentured servitude by the colonial English versus slavery.   I don't know how much you know about it, but the English are the ones that indentured them (and to their own land) prior to the potato famine. The English caused the potato famine because they were taking all of the food from the island. Then many had flee, so they came here and were treated like crap as immigrants but not slaves ever in this country. (Hint- anybody who talks about this on Republican Twitter should be pro asylum)  I want somebody with the ability to research this and get it right to do a video about it... I'm exhausted.  I can't keep having to individually tell my fellow white people that they are morons.  HALP!   -love an american irish girl who's gram came here from Ireland during the famine."

I thought you thought it was bad to be obsessed with skull shape, not to mention white beauty standards? And yet you've spent what must be tens of thousands of dollars turning your body into a Golden Pizza while pretending to be an anti-capitalist. You're not even pretending you're going to try and stop, you're rolling around in a pool of expensive cosmetics and fashion pieces like the dirtiest of the dirty Bourgeois you pretend to hate.   Maybe the worst part: even with all your success and education and successful cosmetic surgery, you still aren't satisfied with yourself, and that hurts."

So anywho, after my workouts I get ready for work and take what I call vanity pics and post them to Instagram.  I always feel self conscious but ... I feel beautiful too. Which helps keep me motivated to work out.  Which has been beneficial to my overall health.  So ... there are lots of reasons to pursue beauty I guess is what I'm saying."
"I'd just like to recommend a youtuber who deserves more views. Please check out Thought Slime."
"The reason that women also wear make-up when they are not in or do not expect male company, in evolutionary terms anyway, is that they are also in competition with one another. Those females who, through their potential ability to attract the opposite sex, can afford to be most selective and still attain reproductive success are at the top of the social hierarchy. You don't need male company to prepare your group dynamic for the next encounter of a potential suitor This is what puts pressure on women to look good for men even when they're among women. The same is the case for men bragging about their workplace accomplishments, how much they can drink or how much they're making when their among one another - because their dominance is determined, by and large, by power and influence over others, competence and the measurer of it all: money. A person who is home alone and not expecting anybody nor intending to go out will never wear make up. We do it for other people. What else would be the point in looking good?"
"don't worry about climate it doesn't worry bout us either, abyss got us all covered."
"I want to say something irrelevant with the video. But something I've been thinking for a long time and I am kind of confused. I was thinking that when it comes to art, as time passes more LGBT people get to be represented, and make art and be recognised etc etc. And that is a good thing. But it makes me kind of scared because it seems that the things that are 'cool' and in nowdays (and I am not talking about mainstream art) are those that revolve around LGBT experiences. I mean it's one thing to be an LGBT person and an artist and create art based on those experiences. But it makes me kind of sad when straight people write books about lesbians, make movies about gays, sing songs abouts LGBT experiences in general and so often. It's like my identity as an LGBT person is a means of them making their art hip and cool and woke and serious. And I as an LGBT person and artist I am one that my art doesn't revolve (I can't think of a better word because I don't speak English that well) around my gender or sexual orientation. And I feel less 'cool' about that. That people are going to be less interested in me because I and my art don't fit their stereotype about queers making art."

"I loathe the idea of beauty ideals, I was a caricature artist for 10 years and many women were uncomfortable with the way they looked, and most men didn’t seem to care at all. It’s pretty obvious that our society and corporations put immense pressure on people to define what is a “ good enough woman” that even in prison with no men around, women are still uncomfortable with the way they look.  Everyone I drew was a composite of feminine and masculine features, often the prettiest people had an interesting mixture of both. Trying to purify yourself of all feminine or masculine traits will only turn you into a caricature of what you think those genders should look like.  I watched most of this video without one mention of ‘subjectivity’ as we all agree on what constitutes beauty and we don’t all agree it’s vast;y different. I grew up convinced I was ugly because I looked kinda like a snaggle toothed orc and it took my experience of a caricature artist watching all these beautiful people hating themselves to figure out that I couldn’t get a date because, I wasn’t putting effort into getting a date, I was ignoring people who did want to date me, and I didn’t conform to anything and enjoyed my status as a goofy weird kid.  What I found out is beauty is the search for a ideal that will never exist, you will never be happy chasing beauty because true objective beauty does not exist. What I found out is there was a flavor an aura I wanted to promote as my look and I’ve been satisfied deeply just going for that aura, I grew up thinking I had to dress manly and now I wear whatever I want to defy anyone who tells me to fit into any kind of mold, still resting within that look I’m going for.   if you have a look or an aura you want to portray I think that is an achievable goal, but to be “beautiful”? That’s like saying I want to be “ the most manly man to ever man’ I DONT NEED TO BE THAT,  what I need to do is be the best version of me that I can be, embrace my flaws and make them work, show people what I’m about and stand my ground.  Natalie you were beautiful  ( to me ) before and you are beautiful now, and if the surgery made you feel more like you that’s great. But I advise you to let go of “beauty’ ideals and focus on what’s the most “Natalie” way you can present yourself, if you’re doing that you will be always beautiful to people who you were meant to be beautiful to."

"Bulgarian here. Part of me was like ''Wooo, shout out to us!'' , but the rest of me was like ''Honey, you can find better smelling things out there, rose water smells weird af''. Other than that - I too spray myself with a bunch of expensive mists and I dunno if they do anything at all, but I end up smelling great! Love your videos, btw."
"I can't abide the time and expense of using makeup at all. There are so many other things I'd rather spend my time and money on! So I put my foot down early on and refused to do any of it. I can't understand why so many women fail to do the same. In my workplace, none of us bother with the whole makeup ripoff. Many eschew hair color as well. We still look beautiful."
"As an enby who had to choose between giving up on conventional beauty standards or going even MORE depressed and suicidal... yeah you ABSOLUTELY have to pick yourself A Style. You are exactly right.   I might not have a gender but I DO have A Style that I'm both genuine about, and for which I genuinely crave people's approval. I'll even accept the 'tomboy woman' label with a cringe so small you'll never see it. But you're still right. Having that personal dedication to A Style feels better than an unconscious pursuit of an outrageous cultural standard."
"Fashion and makeup are a great way to express creativity, which takes intelligence.  It's art, and it's fun.  It is a sad fact that being conventionally attractive gives a person a certain unearned halo and makes many social situations much more pleasant.  However, I wear what I want and it's a great litmus test for who I want to be friendly with (men or women) - if you judge my outre fashion or colorful eyeshadow, F off, we are not compatible.  Makes life simpler and more real."

"Let's stop kidding ourselves here:   You didn't update us on your transition to keep yourself from being dead-named by an AI training database, right?"
"Natalie, welcome back! You've  been  missed! Let me say that you look great, and I'm  glad you're  healing nicely. Of course, I thought you looked lovely before; now, you look naturally softer, but still you! Hopefully, you can get your self-image in line with your beautiful, feminine outside. So says this older cis gender hetero female. 😘 Oh by the way: LOVE that gorgeous, multicolored, sequined blouse! Right up my alley, lol!"

If an incarcerated woman gets really fat from stress eating prison food and doesn't put on her face then her man is more likely to dump her or even worse cheat on her    2) There are male guards in women's prisons. I'm pretty sure there are a lot of male prison guards that will gladly risk their job smuggling in cartons of cigarettes and a bag of cocaine for some booty. The thirst is real    3) women that are unfortunately rape victims of the female version of fleece johnson"

"17:10-17:17 lmfao"
"I've been wondering something for a while and thought this would be the best place to ask. I've noticed that when I'm talking about Natalie's videos from before her transition I'll switch to using masculine pronouns. Is this considered acceptable or something I should work on avoiding from now on?"

I think your videos are good, you have done a valuable service, and you can quit while you're ahead without having to become more miserable than you already are. In a country of 330 million people somebody will fill your shoes, I promise."
"I found this channel a few months ago.  My first thought was I hate this girl.  She makes it hard for the rest of us because you looked so good.  Then I learned about your story through other videos.  I am still a little upset that you wield makeup like a ninja and have great features to apply it on.  Since you are so willing to share your secrets and everything else I feel lucky to have found you.  BTW you look amazing!!!!"

"Your intro deserves an Oscar, mommy😍"
"Well, I am  only gay, so my opinion on female attactiveness is, to some degree, based on very general acceptable appearance. You definitely exceed average attractiveness to me. Can't  really say much beyond that with any confidence,  but I think you looked, and look, great. But the thing that really increases your attractiveness is you seem to be a warm, intelligent,  and ridiculously witty woman. Holy cow, I  just love listening to you talk. I am sorry you struggle with these appearance issues. Makes me sad. Because  you are awesome.  So I  really hope you can find a way to come to grips with  it all. Everything you said in the video is on point, and getting to a point of being fully happy with who you are is hard for everyone.  I know some struggle more than others, for a lot of reasons, with being happy with who they are. But you are amazing,  and a role model for how to at least approach  life with some degree of humor and incredulity at the absurdity of life at all. So just wanted to say I  value who you are as a human being.  Love ya!"
"Listen girlfriend I have always thought you were beautiful and kinda quirky and fun. Keep on keepin on."

"30 is still young! I hate that sort of thinking that you’re old before you’re there. I’m 27 and have been battling that feeling since 23. It detracts from your mental peace in life."

"'Phones live in a society.'  I love you so much  <3"
"Just discovered your channel; I was first perplex with the intro. I love to learn things, thanks. Subscribbed"
"Same can be said about cis people 'alleviating' their pain, which, as yourself, was caused by same ideological gender and just various identities(following your own logic). They are doing that because they are vain, but not you, because being trans makes you a special snowflake and excludes you??  OR are you here, then, accepting that transgenderism is inherently a pathological problem that needs fixing?  Disappointing introduction to contrapoints so far. A lot of blabbering masking double speak hypocrisy."

"This will probably be like stepping into a piranha tank because of how much my opinions differ from the majority here....  But even though I'm straight and can't think of you as a woman; I'll admit that you're beautiful. Beauty is not equal to sex appeal to me tho, it's sort of similar to the appreciation of a piece of art. :)  Really really good job on the video editing and scripting btw! Really professional ^^"
"So in other words, you believe in communism which makes you clinically retarded."
"If it’s any consolation, I only clicked on this video cause it was weirdly on my homepage and I thought you were hot and I only realised you were trans when you said it and even then, I didn’t really feel like you were.  I don’t even know why I just watched this video, but I weirdly enjoyed it. You’re also very, fucking funny."
"Can you do a video on toxicity in popular fandoms?"
"Oh look another propaganda piece from a hyper nihilistic materialist. This is borderline schizophrenic. Hiding behind surgeries changes nothing, keep living in your delusions and spreading this paper thin critical theory trash. Keep consuming because the clock is ticking."
"Okay, so I'm not exactly a fan, I'm not subscribed or have liked any of your videos. I'm just kind of a dude that stumbled onto this. But yeah, you look like a woman to me. Especially that bit in the mirror. I doubt that means anything to you, but yeah. Just thought I'd say."
"At first I liked you, but at 'biological sequins' I loved you.  I'm so glad you're in the world, and I hope you have an amazing day. <3"
"In the end the desire to look attractive and beautiful is in good part for yourself and the social effect its kind of a collateral, but since our very sick culture looks down to how vanity, in balance is part of a healthy self esteem, everyone pretends than the stuff is  for the rest. At least that's my opinion. This video was great, really interesting expose for thinking and awesome editing!  P. S. You look great!"
"You already had a girly face.. but going through surgery just confirmed what actual body shaming is! You protect yourself well from criticism by mentioning facts and twist them as per your convenience, for example as you did when you talked about narcissism. I wonder how many impressionable, innocent people watch your videos like a friend of mine - who kept whispering 'few mm of bones' for days and getting depressed because he cant go through surgery just yet ! Good for you that you're doing great in your life. Sad for people who take you seriously and think of you as their role model.  Hope that people find peace with what they have and thrive for inner development and hope they may  realize that outer beauty means almost nothing at the end. Good wishes to you too Contra. Peace."
"I've always just thought of myself as ugly/plain looking, so no one would ever fall in love with me, based on that. So I didn't bother. Never realy wore makeup in my life.   Huh. Now that I word it out, I should probably tell this to my therapist."
"You sort of imply women's concern for their appearance is more noble than men's. Straight men also care a lot about their appearance when there are only men around.   Also the 'incels having sex won't make their lives more meaningful' comment wasn't very thoughtful. There are just few people for who having sex doesn't add to their life's meaningfulness to one degree or another. Also the incels see someone choosing to have sex with them as validation; it's not so much about the physical act as the way it would make them feel valued. I think it's a little cruel to be flippant about that.   Why is wanting to look good ever 'shallow'? Anyone in their right mind wants to be intelligent, healthy, fit, happy, and beautiful, among other things, and wants those things for people they love.   Is the 'aymak' thing an in-joke? Amok is pronounced 'amuck' afaik."

"I love makeup videos.  So I clicked onnthos video to see what this was about.  Did not expect the young woman to mention she was a trans person.  If she hadn't mentioned it, I never would have known she had urgery for facial reconstruction due to gender transition.  All I saw was a lovely woman discussing plastic surgery.   I wish you happiness and health in this life.  The idea that women seek approval for our appearance is ingrained from cultural standards thay span millennia.  It doesn't matter whether you were born male or female.  The pressure to present oneself as an attractive person is reinforced by the advantages that attractive people are given.  Superficial or not, one's appearance does influence their job opportunities, dating partners and mates, their salary, promotions at work, and opportunities for more on the job training.  We call it an attractiveness stereotype.  I study attractivess and find that a number of variables impact perceived attractiveness, which in turn, leads to either access or denial of important resources.  Transgender, cis gender, and so forth...are all judged based on aspects of their appearance.  Frankly, I find it depressing, but the research is clear.  Women wearing natural makeup (whatever that is) and glamorous makeup (think a well done smokey eye and nude lip look), are rated significantly more attractive, trustworthy, and competent than the same women presented without wearing makeup.  No such effects occur for men.  And in my research we found that men and women provide higher attractiveness ratibgs for a woman with long hair than the same woman adorned with short hair.  So hair length and makeup play a role in perceived attractiveness, which impacts the job opportunities and access to resources for women who display these cues linked with fecundity and youthfulness."
"I haven't studied and made an effort to listen to a video like this in a long time. Probably including my traineeship and time at uni.    0:32 ish: Found out my subwoofer was still turned up to max. Painfully found out that my subwoofer was still at max.  2:09 ish: welp, fuck my appetite, apparently. Let's keep watching. 3:27 ish: that's a huge change. not really noticeable from the front at all, which is probably why I missed it. 5:22 ish: at first I thought 'Yeah, I mean why spend that money? I personally would rather buy a house.' But then I realised I've spent money on stupid shit, which is why my bank account only tenuously exists, so maybe I should shut the fuck up and keep watching.  6:43 ish: serious question - how much of the trans community declares a person transphobic or internally transphobic when you get any work done? 8:00 ish: or is it a response to society? 8:20 ish: Is it kind of like how I always make sure I cover my sweaty spots with deodorant every time I leave the house out of a desire to never be compared to the sweaty disgusting nerds of yesteryear and (unfortunately) today? 9:25 ish: 'bussy'?  11:25 ish: are humans just not meant to sit and stare and self-reflect for large periods of time?"
"Did you just quote Hunter S Thompson in the middle of a skin care tutorial that's part of a philosophical study of the concept of beauty?"
"I was legit wanting to comment and ask if you were trans but at least I don't have to! Also sis at first I had no idea you were trans until I really really listened to your voice"
"To start my comment: I began watching and being delighted by your videos when you were (I think) in your first year and a half or so of YouTubing. Some stuff happened in my life. Then, I became Catholic; I joined a Church that has some rigorous teachings on human sexuality, and have personally come to terms with these.  There's a voice inside me that wants to plead with you to reconsider your transition.  Otherwise, I'd like to posit that one can, and should, make efforts to look attractive somewhere between the extremes of 'obsession with beauty' and 'the futility of trying to stop caring how we look.'  God bless you (really)."

"according to JP, apparently asexual, and aromatic people wear makeup to sexual themselves... its definitely not that makeup is just a form of art, and representative of a person's self expression and enjoyment. and huh, women should stop wearing makeup - its almost like he is saying that is a gender norm that should be abolished... not some matter of biology, but rather a social standard. I would think from this understanding he'd see another reason why women wear makeup then, cause its a social standard, more than anything else."

"I was assigned female at birth and when I present as more female I still look more 'masculine' than a lot of women, trans or cis. It's just shitty that cishet men define beauty as waify 12 year olds with wide-eyes and no hair anywhere but the head."
"revolutionnaires didnt think about the sex, they thought about a revolution (sure, sometimes it happens to them lol) . Many of them were poor and could not afford something equivalent SRS, FFS and WTF. many of them died as result of illness. thank for our god (who doesnt exist), now it is possible to get that shit for revolutionists from US(revolutionists from other countries can get it by Tha). But i look forward for the new video of CM and every time am hearing her voice. CP is so beautiful and inimitable, but CM is so charming... but even CM so far from sufficient, that will be in future."
"Homo Sap. is social nature, un-natural nature, so many concepts are non-personal, it are depend to socium (like a language as  example) and without society do not exist in usual case. When one looks at oneself he/she does it by social eyes, by social brain. but what is a man and what is a woman? it is two different races of humans. they must have same rights, they can have same behavior generally, but it looks two different ways, as evidently as the black or the white skin. And a human can see it - just can see it - in 95(6,7,8) times of 100. A tolerance is the same rights, isnt turn white to black or othervise. There is a case, when one 'feel oneself as a other race'. wait, there was with Michael Jackson??  oshi..  but he was on a rite way, if u wanna be a white  the ppl's eyes. hmm, i am supposed to say ' u can paint it black', but wut bout u? do u wanna see it female? ok, u can crossdressing, but i think there is one, who can make ur dreams go bad. so, this is a worst one, he can break the best things wut u have.  ok, jesuites. if it necessary, we must to call the white is the black. ok, HRT and SRS. well, its fine, its a realy good choice. but.. what is 'feeling'? which sensation u need to fill thts shit? the vision? wut about  hearing? oh no, pls. fkn testosterone, everything went bad. that damn thing have been grown all shit before one wanna some gal. think  generally Lili Elbe sill incomplete the 'Dresden' quest now."

"Also, too bad that you start by recognising that desiring less beauty is a healthy way out the frustration spiral, then immediately after produce a plea on the crucial importance of beauty. Wouldn't the pursuit of beauty be better for yourself if you were in control of your involvment in it? Not every wise breakthrough has to come to a punchline/ tone break (or does it on youtube?). You have some amazingly profound insights on the backstage of desires, I don't get why you don't (seem) to take them serious yourself."

It's weird to say but some people's facial looks can fit/not fit/ work just fine with/Meh with different styles. It's weird but honestly things do seem like that now that I'm thinking about it. lol"
"that dress is fabulous. reminds me of my gal pal freckle. contra, you look wonderful. you are wonderful."
"If you can't tell what beauty is (for you) such that you need other people, then who are you trying to be beautiful for?  If it's you then you have a goal that's unachievable because you don't know what it is. If it's other people then why are you cratering your life to reflect superficial charateristics for others? This kind of external validation seems unhealthy to me - put your foot down, take control, choose to stop (would be my plebian advice).  Also, I'll try and give you what you want - honesty. I'm a strait man and you mostly look like a cute woman to me (mostly). Sometimes my eye catches a bit of maleness and the cuteness equation changes a little, but the female outweighs the male pretty consistently to my eye. I've also only seen you at the angles in the lighting you have in your videos, so things would probably change in person. I'm not saying this to be cliche, it probably sounds hollow, and you probably won't accept it, but I honestly think you are fine the way you are, you are beautiful. The art you make is beautiful. While I don't agree with your lazy use of trite labels like 'fighting facism' and the like, you are great! So just be yourself and everything will be ok. If that means constantly toiling over beauty then it is what it is, but try not to beat yourself up too much. (I get pretty frustrated about things sometimes. I've tried to train myself to notice when I'm getting overly frustrated, and I just repeat to myself 'your frustration will not help you.')"
"If it makes any difference, I'm watching this with my 4yo and they said 'When I'm bigger can I have colourful eye shadow and a beautiful dress like her?' I asked 'Do you think she's pretty?' and heard back 'Yes. I love her hair.' I know there are 4yo kids who are good liars, but mine has no concept of flattery at this stage. I trust their opinion - they once told me my legs and butt looked huge in my ski pants (which they totally do) :p -Maxx and Gwen"
"I laughed way too much at the spf joke. I guess I've been really stuck in this exact loop for about a year sans the trans aspect. I really didn't want to think too much about it, like I have other problems and this is supposed to be a fun distraction from that, but it's become a problem itself, a chore, expensive, rarely ever fun, just making me feel like shit and fearful of aging (which I am, at 37). I put off watching this since it was posted, but yeah, it was time. Ugh."
"God she's awesome"
"ContraPoints, the first video of yours that I watched, the Jordan Peterson one, I noticed you talked  some about trans women, but I honestly just assumed that it was part of the theme of that one video or that it was a subject that you had chosen and that you were speaking on their behalf.  You know, I just saw a woman.  A very attractive woman.  After watching enough more to better understand who you are, something very real has changed in me, a heterosexual man.  Admittedly an older man, but not dead yet.  For the first time in my long life, something or some things that you said, helped me to understand that you (and if you then surely many others) in a very genuine way have always been a woman.  This is somehow a game changer for me.    I'd never heard or understood the term gender dysphoria before.  I'm now pretty hooked on your channel.   So.... I felt that I really wanted to say, 'thank you'."

"A main theme of TRH(P)S, at least as I see it,* is the futile attempt to compensate for foregoing genuine human connection, especially by trying to acquire prestige instead. It is prominent in Frank’s case, as he creates picture-perfect Rocky to replace his previous, more homely lover Eddie. In many ways it feels eerily prophetic with the rise of social media. Eventually, Frank has hurt enough people deeply enough that the consequences come back to get him—fatally so. Dr. Scott even justifies it, claiming, ‘Society must be protected.’ And then it hit me: Brad can’t use the phone, because castles don’t have phones, asshole!, because… _phones live in a society._ [Cue _X-files_ theme]  *https://svartikotturinn.tumblr.com/post/178599677203/why-the-rocky-horror-picture-show-is-not-outdated"

"what you said about the relation between beauty, femininity and gender euphoria/dysphoria hits really close to home. see, i'm a twinky gay trans boy, which makes things difficult for me because i'd love to wear dresses and makeup and be all pretty and shiny and decorated, but that's just not an option for me because i already get called 'miss' when i go to restaurants and i don't think i could handle looking any more feminine than i do while wearing baggy jeans and gamer hoodies. my desire for beauty is in direct conflict with my desire to look masculine."

"That Fear and Loathing reference goddamn"
"As a trans nonbinary person, I feel guilty thinking about plastic surgery. I'm not trying to be masculine or feminine, so... what does that leave me with? What do I do? Is it because I was socialized as a woman and therefore expected to change myself in various ways, or is it because of dysphoria? I also have quite a lot of cellulite, even though I'm fit. Does it make me feel horrible because it's a very feminine trait, or because I personally don't like it on myself? It can be incredibly hard to sift through personal and societal preference. I'm not sure that we can completely separate the two. All I know is that I want to look totally androgynous AND be able to wear a thousand sequins like you!"
"That has to be the best 31minutes I'll have all day. Natalie you ARE a beautiful person, true beauty comes from inside between your ears. Yes you look great, the outfit is amazing and well off the style scale, and you communicate beautifully, but all that is down to what's in your head. Every woman I know has insecurity issues which I put firmly at the advertising company's causing. Males have it too but nowhere near as bad. Can it really be so much harder to be a beautiful, stylish communicator rather than pretend to be something you (and I) never were? As an alcoholic I accept that I am predisposed to addiction, be careful that you don't get addicted to surgery, YouTube is full of the horrors that can result, it doesn't need another one."

"Hey, I don't have a Twitter, but I wanted to let you know that the NewYork Times article about the guy who was radicalized uses you in the picture montage they show.  You tweeted about it but I wasn't sure if you were aware."
"Yup. It is a properly worthwhile philosophical puzzle. A maze. A worthwhile maze. A maze with no exit, or a maze runner who insists on ignoring the exit...not so much fun. Worthwhile = difficult. Here are some solid walls that underpin the maze.  1) Human beings and multi cellular organisms generally value beauty relative to other valuable things as part of the wider continuum of valuable things. 2) People also value wisdom and courage and sobriety and wit in that wider continuum. 3) Aging and death is a thing. 4) People are an unstable coalition of conflicting moods and impulses. 5) People contain a divine spark and consciousness of a duty to honour that in each other.  Those 5 points there are plenty enough to focus on. Beyond that? Just a mess of dead ends really. What? Those 5 points are not hard boiled grim reality enough? Beyond those 5 points is a whole mess of confusion. Confusion is.....hmm...what's the word?...' Messy' maybe? I think ' ugly' is better.  So for example, here is a confusing axiom:- ' Everybody lies'. Ugly bit of thinking. Because...y'know...well YEAH...but what does anybody DO with that? Yeah. Sure. But so what? Natalie is desperate, driven, compelled, obsessed by furious demons of bone structure. The bones were perfectly fine bones before, are perfectly fine now after minimal interference. All that might go wrong is more bone mania. Nobody worth a damn gives a damn about bones. Nothing wrong with bones, or with shoot em up misogynistic video games, or with windy rhetoric, or with the odd alcohol bender, or with collecting hotels and golf courses, or with any other healthily competitive youthful mania. Just don't go MAD is all. Face is young. Face is beautiful whether golden lad, or golden lass aspect. It's ALL good yo. Leave it the fxxx alone now. There. Is that hard boiled harsh patriarchal Jordan Peterson daddy style tell it like it is tough love scolding ENOUGH? Hope so. There can only be so much. It can only reach ears ready to hear. Peace. Out."

"I can't wait to see you regretting transitioning. You are going to age like a man, no matter how many hormones you take or how many plastic surgeries you have, at the end you can't have babies. This is all a disgusting sexual fetish you aren't a woman you are just a mentally ill weirdo."

"Honestly Natalie I feel like it's something of a universal female experience* to wonder how much of your personal habits are you and how much is the Patriarchy.

"I want to thank you for sharing your journey. As a cis gender, straight female, I had the privilege of being brought up with the discrimination and mixed messages, you only had inflicted upon you as an adult. You did not have the life-long preparation for the kinds of issues women experience that cis women are trained to expect. I can only imagine the mental games this might play out in someone's mind.  Your videos have really helped me gain a better understanding of the 'plight of trans' (for lack of a better term). I won't lie and say that I completely 'get it.' I will however, say that I have much more respect and appreciation for your experiences as a woman, after watching your evolution via youtube video. I have known trans people before, but never had an appropriate opportunity to engage in an honest discussion of the subject with them. So thank you for the perspective.   By the way, you are beautiful. I will likely comment more on the beauty issue at another time. For today, I really just wanted to acknowledge your brave journey."

Just find something as engaging to do as looking at your face in the mirror, on the monitors, in the shining reflections in the eyes of your fans. (While simultaneously yanking your mighty girl dick, of course.) Maybe take just a smidgen of your passion for yourself and your hatred of yourself and redirect it toward something--anything--that is not yougloriousyou! Teach dirty little waifs how to read. Help toss dying whales back into the ocean. Get a bag and a pointy stick and clean up litter somewhere that's really ugly. Take half your patreon loot from this month, get a pile of fifty dollar bills and hand them out to people who are somewhere outside of your boudoir who look lovely or happy or sad or poor or whatever could be somewhat, somehow as interesting as your stupid face.

Videos can be as much for the people who make them as those who consume them. If you want to be Gigi Gorgeous do it up; and if you want a societally focused reason to do so then know that you are being the representation you want to see in the world. Also real talk the idea that you don't have style is categorically untrue, it is an incredible strong suit you have clear mastery over.  Tl:Dr I (a random internet person) hope that you (a person who will almost certainly never read my words) please produce content that serves not only your society but also yourself, because I have utmost confidence that even if the shift is something I don't prefer that I will nonetheless appreciate the style with which the shift happens and the effect that it has."

"I woke up to that intro with the weirdest scariest boner thought I tripped on acid hey hell aiant that bad I said"
"Marry me? Also, can i lay down in fetal position, put my head on your lap and cry?"
"I desperately wish she'd start an asmr channel on the side. Every time she jokingly does asmr things I find it so relaxing."
"People like looking at pretty things. It ok  to enjoy beauty and to want to be beautiful.  I mean you're gonna get judged and you know it cause you said as much. But it is ok.  And your style is excellent. It brings me aesthetic joy."
"I noticed your face before you said anything. It looks amazing!"
"The intro to this video is absolutely the best intro i've seen in years."
"I absolutely LOVE your videos, I'm constantly surprised by how you address every point and deflate superficial arguments WHILE also entertaining me! Thanks for all your hard work XOXO 💙"
"SEQUINS!!!!!"
"Natalie! I just started the video, and I just have to say really fast that you look so incredibly gorgeous!! You were already beautiful before FFS, but I’m so happy that you made a decision that felt right :)"
"I adore you."
"Sexplanations talked about the mouthfeel"
"'Isn't it safer to just secretly fall in love with them while dying inside?' How dare you come into my house, on this, the day of my daughter's wedding, and out my internal process like this!"
"Pssh, I haven’t felt beautiful since I was eight. Eighteen years later, I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’m an absolute trash boat and that’s made all the difference."
"That intro was low key fire."
"Jordan Peterson doesn't let me watch Yu-Gi-Oh :("
"It's almost ironic that you skip sunscreen, it's the most helpful skincare product to avoid aging. A broad spectrum with SPF 30 or 50 suncreen protects you not just from freckles, but can also prevent hyperpigmentation and also slows down aging very very much because it protects your skin from UVA rays, which causes aging. Free radicals and break down of collagen also results in your skip losing elasticity, these will cause wrinkles. Also moisturising is important as dryness causes aging as well. Lastly, avoid tobacco, which breaks down collagen, and alcohol, which causes dryness. Especially if your skincare products also contain alcohol, it will dry out your skin. Topical and oral vitamin A can reverse aging and stimulate collagen production and cause faster cell renewal. If youonly take away one thing from reading this, it must be that you MUST use sunscreen, it is absolutely the best at preventing further aging, but only vitamin A can 'reverse' aging. Dear Natalie, you are beautiful and even more so after the surgery, but please use sunscreen, it will keep you beautiful."
"glad you are doing well"
"Love your videos Natalie! So, I miss the ciphers you used to do, they were engaging and fun! Definitely was a very creative touch and I'd love to see one in the future!"
"So what are your view on vox controversy with steven crowder"
"9:15 I just wanna say when your raised as a male who is a very smart middle class minority with no athletic skills, everyone treats you as a little feminine freak! By the way I love that you always call out white privilege!"
"Watched this and immediately afterwards did a face mask."
"Contrapoints, I doubt you will see or read this but I must ask are you religious and what religion are you? The reason I need to ask this is I notice you often take shots at atheists in your videos. In your videos you take shots at The Amazing Atheist, Thunderfoot, Armored Skeptic, and even Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkings. I find it ironic that you go after atheists so much when atheists are tolerant of transgender people. You are a transgender person who hates atheist and atheism, what are your religious beliefs?"
"*doesnt pass* 'You're a mannish oaf!' *passes* 'You're just a stereotype!'"

"If it helps, you do look rather fish.  ... Now take that dopamine hit. Take it. Oooh, yeah. Mmmm... feels good doesn't it? ;D"
"Do I hear some Erik Satie?"
"I would have appreciated a TW about surgeries and detailed descriptions about them. I didn't know it would get so in depth at some points and it kind of triggered me. Not that it wasn't a nice or informative video, but it did test my ability to watch it. It would have probably been better for me if I had the option to skip the operation descriptions or at least have a TW up front so I could prepare myself."
"damn the jail thing really made me sad :( fuck them ughhh."
"aww I'm sorry you pass both before and after IMO!   and by the logic of 'other's have it worse' noone but a single person is allowed to complain or be sad :P and I mean what scale determines that? yes you're privileged for that but why do we use it as if it's a swear word? yes I'm privileged to have a leg but that doesn't stop the bullet in my face from hurting. you know what i mean?"
"You oughta mistake your reflection for a random stranger out of the corner of your eye to judge your own beauty. Not really something you can plan, but go to a crowded place with lots of mirrors to try."
"You are an amazing woman, also smart, funny AF and beautiful. I lol'd your callout to ASMR."
"She!"

"You are not a woman, you never will be. You are but a grotesque caricature of a woman."
"TBH you were the most beautiful in the shot where you had no makeup and your skin might be clearer if you use less products. They all will interact with each other on and in your skin."

"you kinda look like Winona Ryder in your own unique, beautiful way <3"
"lesbians are chilling cuz we all are so in love with girls we can’t hate really ourselves"
"Love Dermalogica! If you use the powder every day and find it’s a little irritating, I love the REN glow tonic. It’s a chemical exfoliant (AHAs, glycolic acid) that I use every morning. I think it’s a great balance of being exfoliating enough without being too exfoliating or irritating at all. Plus it smells nice and makes me feel ~beautiful~ eww lol"
"As an almost 6ft cis woman who has struggled with alot of dysphoria growing up I understand how hard it can be to learn to like yourself in that manner. I'm gay struggled alot with the idea that people would consider me butch to the point where it stopped me coming out for a long time, and I still deal with it because my wife is alot more conventionally feminine.   You don't have to feel bad for caring about how people see you, find things that make you feel comfortable and enjoy them. Growing out my hair and switching to more skirts and dresses has done wonders for how bad I used to/sometimes still feel.  You like makeup so enjoy it, my sister does too. Pretending that your worried make you petty is a losing game. I wore only Tshirts and jeans and pretended I didn't care what people though of me, and it just makes you feel gross.   Also, and this is not flattery, that fact that people would ever clock you (before or after the surgery) is pretty amazing to me. You don't have any traits that really stick out to me as masculine."
"Natalie wyn. I need your opinion, my cousin is homophobic because they just act like women. should I or should,I not, tell him about trans people. thanks for reading."
"I do so love your sequins."
"jesus fuck that intro"
"ok using sofie in the beginning you snapped"
"The way she calls jp daddy 😂😂😂"
"So, I'm not a fan nor a hater I sometimes watch your videos to get a different perspective. I say, you are very feminine and beautiful. I would even fuck you after having a few drinks together and then again in the morning."
"I liked you before and I like you now. I like brains and souls. You have both that are worthy. Bisexual queer female here. I would never post on Instagram or Facebook. It's awful for self esteem. I don't know how to put on makeup and i live."
"I loved your old nose, but I still love you now. And the dress! OMG!!"
"Girl you look like the beautiful lesbian love child of Céline Dion and Carrie Fischer!  😘"
"Life is not about finding yourself, it is about creating yourself. The life and art you create are things that are making this world better."

"I love u and ur amazing and beautiful"
"Your videos are art. I appreciate them so much. I wish you the greatest success in reaching as many people as possible. You are so genuine and creative. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart."
"That intro is *chef kiss*"
"And this is why she’s my favorite YouTuber 💅"
"21:18: Hunter S. Thompson Reference! What do I win?"
"You look like a younger Celine Dion now, and that's a good thing!"
"Why don't you stress instead that this obsession over 'beauty' of oneself (be it male or female or other) is pathological. I'm not judging, I have it a bit too. You mention its politics in passing but you could have also criticized it, not just accepting it. This makeup craze fuels misogyny (shallow women only care about their looks) and trans-phobia (trans women being parodies of female stereotypes). Love your videos btw!"
"Congratulations on your surgery now instead of looking like a feminine homosexual you look like a blokeish girl."
"Did I hear a Hunter S. Thompson's 'Fear And Loathing' reference? YES."
"I love ur stealthy 'Death Becomes Her' reference."
"'You know. You can still look hot if you don't pass. Just look at Contrapoints.'   Ouch. The well intentioned dagger to the heart always pierces deepest."
"The uhhh point about not being able to tell if you're beautiful the same way a trans person can't tell if they pass struck me like LIGHTNING, especially because it's so important for me to be able to pass where I live. I've become obsessed with cultivating the look of a Biological Man (TM). The problem is, it feels like I'm trading personal style to achieve that. Straight men casual clothes are largely gross and I want out.  Help"
"Um, I've always considered you beautiful (and not as a fanboy). Seriously.  Keep up the great philosophical content :)"
"I've come back to watch  this a few times. Some of your best work yet! I do love the callbacks to old characters too"
"Hey Natalie, I'm sure you won't read this but as you probably hear a lot, you (and others) have been a tremendous help to me and others. I'm just now embracing gender fluidity and not feeling AWFUL about it and it's totally like 50/50 super-intelligent videos like the ones you make and real life friends being cool. I didn't think I could be this happy. Thanks."
"People have commented about your collarbones? I think they're a very pretty feature of yours..."
"I love your honesty and how you think about everything"
"I love you for perfectly articulating the the thoughts I'm not eloquent enough to express.Also I love you for being cool as fuck"
"This is a good video on facial plastic surgery,I have more beauty tips for you.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNArblYVd3Q"
"i love that hst reference"
"As a recent discovered Bisexual, I can assure you never looked ugly or unnatractive, not a single day in your life! I also tend to relate testosterone provoked characteristics with unattractive,  but not a single day in your life you were unattractive. You look like a beautiful princess now and I feel to be looking at the best version of you, because you look very happy at the way you look. You're amazing Thank you for the inspiration"
"Natalie you are marvelous"
"Very Pretty"
"'Now I'm ***smoother than a cis-gender boiled egg!***'  - Contrapoints, 2019"
"First of all, Natalie, you're my role model.   With regards to the idea of giving up the desire to be beautiful - I had a couple years where I genuinely didn't care about my appearance at all. Mostly because I was arrogant enough to firmly believe it was a waste of my time. But even when I sincerely gave up that desire, practical consequences followed from not putting effort into my appearance. Now that I've started caring again, people treat me REALLY differently - they take me more seriously professionally, they're more willing to help me, they're more willing to get to know me. Literally just the fact that people LOOK at me more opens up opportunities to engage with my world. When I didn't try, people didn't acknowledge or value me.   And looking good isn't just an obligation. I'm having fun with style and playing with exaggerated femininity. I just want to give my account because even sincerely letting go of the desire for beauty wasn't really a solution. I still had to live in a world that cares how I look and it didn't go swimmingly."
"You're brilliant and beautiful."
"Yet another incredible upload, just the writing in these videos is beyond amazing, a fabulous mix of facts, thought provoking philosophy that's relatable AF about things everyone thinks about, memes and self awareness.   And the nods to your older videos, witnessing your glow-up makes me weirdly proud? Keep doing everything you're doing, it's so entertaining and enlightening <3   ps, choke me mommy"
"I'm a photographer and video editor and I have a weird complex for other people and myself and it makes me kinda always feel like an asshole so I over compensate by being as nice to people as possible"
"That skincare routine hit too close to home. 😂👌"
"Natalie, if you are ever in Utah: 1. I'm sorry.    2. You have an open invitation to have a girls sleepover with me, no cameras anywhere, and I'll braid your beautiful hair. 3. Will you be a Victorian style governess to my daughters (well, so far, I know one of them is a daughter), and teach them that education is important, it’s great to show off your smarts, be respectful to people, and just generally be both strong and ladylike young ladies.  Maybe that’s how we change society!  You should start a school!  Can you imagine?!  Ms. Natalie’s finishing school for strong and feminine young ladies."
"Makeup is time-consuming and expensive and I imagine most science-y PHD women don't wear it because they only know about Covergirl drug store makeup and don't bother with it because it's useless."
"I’ve already posted all over this comment thread, but I just wanted to say I think Nat was soo pretty when she was presenting as masculine, and even prettier when her outside matched her inside (I just a lot more attracted to her when she was masculine because I'm ”straight.”  Now I just want to have a slumber party with her and have a long, deep, ”sub” gossip with her.)"
"Also, you just like what you like.  I'm straight, cis, feminist, and usually don't bother with makeup, but I don't feel like I'm completely ”dressed” unless my nails are PERFECT.    I’m also a woman ”of a certain age”, and anyone, male, female, intersex, neutral, and whatever I may have missed, want to augment their look when they start feeling that clock ticking.  If you and James Charles teamed up on anything, I would throw ALL of my money at both of you."
"the most interesting channel on youtube"
"'maybe lesbians are just straight chillin' a tad more I'd say. Not by much tho, probably."
"Idk if it means anything to you or if it will help you feel more beautiful, but I think you are very pretty. I just discovered your channel and, upon looking at you, I didn't even realize you were transgender until you said so. I don't mean to imply that transgender people are less attractive (since that's not true,) but I mean that your face does look feminine. You're more gorgeous than me and I was born female, lol"
"why fix your beta incel chin though ?  Ps: People who do nose jobs are insecure loosers, you can't operate your inner self doubt"
"Wear your sunscreen. The sun is a deadly lazer. It also doesn't help avoiding ageing."
"In all honestly you always had a naturally feminine face so your transistion was always going to go pretty well.  You didn't look any more masculine than your average European woman before surgery."
"Transgender women are not women. Kiss my lesbian ass you male invader."
"Go die in a fire. You manslut."
"You look pretty good without makeup tho. Nice skin too. At least on camera"
"I wish I was desired and pretty as I've never experienced that, I've had fantasies since I was a child I could say Shazam and turn in to a beautiful woman but sadly reality can't be bent to my will but in gaming I usually go for female or genderbending characters like the Witcher or Raiden in MGS2"
"I first saw your content about a year ago, then proceeded to binge watched most of the videos on your channel in no particular order.  You are definitely evolving.  I know it's hard to see from your own viewpoint, but every time you put out a new video, I think, 'Damn!  Natalie looks so good!'  Also, as a cis woman, I gotta say that I feel pretty similarly about only looking good one or two days a month when everything magically aligns."
"Hi Natalie I have been with you on the journey. As a 59 year old person ( no gender for me) I just hope you stay well always I do think you are beautiful on out side but more than that your 💓 is shiny bright. I . The intellectual mashup with your personal is why I keep coming back to your comments."
"No joke, without makeup I was like 'holy shit Simone Giertz'"
"“style is a way of cultivating a personal aesthetic that you have complete control over. it’s like art, in that originality is a virtue. style is an individual aesthetic, unlike the collective aesthetic of beauty standards.” HECK YES"
"Oi! Gobbos 'ave roights too, ya know! We get stepped on more than any ov yoos! Heck, they aven't even bovvad ta check if we 'AVE genders! And 'passing'? PAH! No-one wants to pass as a gobbo, and a gobbo can't pass as an ork.  Oh, and a newsflash for Natalie: some girls don't wear makeup 'cause they look better without it."
"Omg. The way you talked about how white boys are treated when they are slightly intelligent!!! I’ve got a 3.9 gpa in science and I feel like barely anyone glances at me or understands that I am actually intelligent. I’ve had to downplay my feminine aspects just to be taken seriously. Love how real you are. Just subscribed to your channel! So glad to have found you!"
"Hyaluronic acid is the bomb. For anybody getting into skincare I recommend trying The Ordinary because it's the cut down version of all those expensive skincare products out there so you can figure out which active ingredients work for you.  Then if you want you can go buy the $70 fancy stuff from inebriated pachyderms, or whatever. It's also good if you have allergies because my  body/skin hates life and I need to avoid extra stuff that could give me hives."
"You’re pretty like Donna but not Jackie"
"'If all the men died tomorrow, I'd definitely keep wearing makeup. In fact I might wear more!'  Mood."
"That's weird but you look more feminine without make up in my eyes, maybe I'm just strange"
"Although I agree with how you wrote the script and added nuance, I still disagree quite strongly with the vibe I get that you 'cant help but conform to societal beauty standards'. I appreciate you water this down somewhat and have more nuance than that, but... no. This is really harmful to your mental health and IMO just not the right way of going through life. I feel like the aesthetic issues you have with your body get blown waaaay out of proportion.   Now, don't get me wrong. If you genuinely enjoy, intrinsically, grooming and if getting all kinds of cosmetic surgery is all you ever wanted in life then more power to you. Plenty of people do things I couldn't disagree with more, but if that's their ultimate turn-on, go for it. What I find harmful is if you don't actually intrinsically enjoy it or find it useful but still do it because you feel pressured to the point of not just doing some nominal grooming but wasting significant portions of your time to make yourself pretty.    A large part of my development becoming mentally mature was figuring out how to 1) regard my own behaviour somewhat objectively, 2) evaluating it and 3) doing something about it. As a male, I have a few issues with body hair and in a perfect world I'd do the full body laser removal, but giving in to this desire would IMO worsen my mental state about it. Right now I have to confront a myriad of imperfections and that's a good thing, it makes me prioritize what is actually important and what's frivolous. If I'd fix that problem, I would find another, and then increasingly less important problems, because that's how the human mind works. It's never enough. You can preempt this bullshit. It's not easy, but, again IMO, it is worth it to become a more in-touch, well-balanced adult individual."
"Your channel thrives on aesthetics. Stop blaming everything on society and stop posing yourself as ultimate victim."
"I'm neither a fan nor a hater, so at this point I don't care about the outcome, but I think you look pretty."
"Where do people get the money for such expensive cosmetic surgery? If I was trans I would just wear a pair of pink tracksuits pants and call it a day."
"Satan's apple XD XD XD"
"I never thought a healthy preoccupation with physical appearance made anyone shallow, men or women.  Humans naturally seek beauty in art, nature and their surroundings; we enjoy looking at beautiful things because they  enliven the soul. An attraction towards beautiful sounds or pleasing scents doesn't lead people to dismiss those seeking them as 'shallow,'  so why should sight be the only one of the five sense which is held to such a stringent moral standard?"
"Dopamine hit being flung from over yonder: you are gorgeous, and interestingly well thought out in a believable brilliance that I am now addicted to. So thank you!"
"I think u nailed it in the beginning of your video, yes all plastic surgery is superficial (aside from an injury/deformity) and a reponse to societal pressures and expectations. Putting on a wig or eyeliner wont change who u are in any meaningful way, but if its important to you to look the part instead of look at yourself, go for it. Vanity is something to come to terms with, not deny, we re all slaves to beauty, I'm not surprised your surgery didnt fill the void in your soul or w e, and no amount ever will. Sumone as smart as you already knows all this."
"Before ffs brow bone/ forehead looks like my current forehead. I am a cis female."
"bruh"
"I'm so sorry for how that must have made you feel when you read that comment on Reddit. For what it's worth, post-FFS you're way more passable than Celine Dion."
"I find it hilarious that you always said that centrist allign with fascism while your fellow ancom and comrade Batko and his centrist friend Kraut'n'Tea doxxed numerous people who didn't not support their Lefty mumbo jumbo"
"“You, yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection.” (Siddhartha Gautama/ The Buddha).   Try and remember that, Natalie.  It’ll likely be a lifelong struggle to realize this, but don’t give in and know that you have tons of supporters who care about you."
"IMHO, the surgeries were totally unnecessary. Contrapoints already passed as a cis woman. In fact, the first time I saw an excerpt of a Contrapoints video, I just thought she was a biological female. I was really surprised to learn she was trans. I think that the people who said she didn't pass only said that because they already knew that she was trans, so they were biased. I know it's hard, but I really don't think she needs to worry about passing. She looks like a smart, attractive woman."
"I too am locked in a struggle with my own brain that refuses to make me feel happy while fixating on useless, hyperbolic and often contradictory thought patterns that lead me into horrific endless spirals of doom. I wish you luck in your continued journey to find a greater happiness and inner peace.    PS you look good hun c: (Being genuine is hard when truth is subjective. Thanks postmodernism)   Sincerely  This Confused and Sad Autistic Non-Binary"

"Art vs Artifice. A bit heavy on the powder, Dearie. Is there something in the water in Balt. that produced both John Waters and you? These videos have lost their verve along with everything else that was attractive and interesting. What happened to the wonder that was Nykytyne and pre-op Contrapoints? Why not envy Gore Vidal instead of GGG?"
"You look really good. And you do pass."
"hm i cant really see the difference, just looks like u got a nose job u didnt need *shrug*"
"OMG I love SOPHIE so fucking much"
"Unrecognizable now."
"Yes, you're pretty. K, bye."
"Woah, as someone who never wears make-up and is used to the look, even without much on, in the end of the video, you look so much more beautiful than the average woman. But I guess average is not what you are after, thats the whole point, isnt it :D Also, thanks for telling me I look diseased, I never got told anything negative, only got compliments, maybe we shouldnt generalize as much ;)"
"Natalie, I love how you discuss with yourself. You explain all the different voices in my head and you are always so reflective about yourself. You see the problems you (and a lot of other people too) have with yourself and find the power to forgive yourself. And you show that to me and other people. You really touch me with your kindness towards all human beings."

"Natalie we all have so much time for you, you wonderful intelligent bugger you!!!!!!!"
"There's a new Refinery 29 has a new documentary about how homeless women also love make-up, especially as it makes them feel like 'real' people and not just homeless. There's this amazing women Shirley: https://www.instagram.com/beauty2thestreetz who helps with that."

"I was told to come here by Adam Conover on a Joe Rogan podcast saying these are incredibly funny.   This shit wasn't funny even in the slightest. All I saw was a guy in makeup talking. I mean, that's fine with me, go for it, but you're still a guy."
"SOPHIE BITCH YAS MY FACE IS THE FRONT OF SHOPPPPPPPP"

"Is JP just...fully not wearing shoes in that interview? Is that one of the twelve rules for life? 'Only cucks wear shoes'??"
"I was always wary of Natalie as I only knew her from her debate w Blaire (what a mess that was) but after actually getting into her videos and idpol, I came to realise we share very similar experiences and ideologies regarding pc and edge culture. I have a new found respect after watching her grow and elaborate upon concepts that are hard for most people to even bring up in any capacity, not to mention being able to pull receipts, cite sources, and wrapping it all up with an elegant self deprecative humour. Props to all the research and hard work she puts in i Stan this smart ass mouth-feel qween"

"Maybe stop being an adventurist radlib, then you will learn to accept yourself. You don’t have to beat yourself up and call yourself “problematic” for wanting to feel beautiful. You don’t have to constantly challenge “western standards of beauty.” Just be yourself, Natalie."
"Lost it at 'Starfish Night'. I will never look at van Gogh paintings the same way. Really... Rule 34."
"does anyone know what the painting from 0:11 is?"
"You look great 👍....just condition your hair, and that chisel mark..it’ll fade in time, j/k. By the way...that story about catching up with an old friend and spending it getting “reacquainted” from a much earlier video wouldn’t happen to be Adam Conover, would it? The guy really talked you up."
"The way you voice all of these thoughts and feelings so many of us are scared to admit is incredibly admirable. I love watching your videos because you're so articulate and have just the right balance of weirdness/chaos and sensible, important arguments. Keep doing what you do.  P.S. Love the use of SOPHIE's Faceshopping for the opening, fits your aesthetic very well. I should have guessed you would be into her music. 😂"
"Nat: Maybe lesbians are just straight chillin Me: BRING BACK THE FUCKING SEQUINS ASMR IM LOSING MY COLLECTIVE SHIT"
"You put my thoughts into words. Keep doing what you do."
"No. You should not forgive yourself for wanting to be beautiful to the point of spending tens of thousands of dollars to change that, then complain when it doesn't work. You should actively work to change that mentality rather than make a half hour video half-whining, half-justifying your behavior. What a terrible representative of transgendered people. I love you but this video was 100% bullshit"
"I don't feel particularly strongly one way or the other about the 'whys' of the pursuit of beauty, but I think the objection to the claim that we largely do it out of sexual interest by saying 'that's not why I do it' or 'I do it to feel good about myself' or 'I do it out of social pressure' etc. Or basically any other explanation that relies largely on introspection is that it fundamentally confuses both the argument and the context of the academic discipline it comes from.  The argument isn't that women wear make-up or men hit the gym because they're consciously trying to hook people (although certainly some are). The argument is that the fundamental inclination that drives the behavior is rooted in that biological inclination.   The idea is rooted within a view of humans, not as rational actors, but as rationalizing actors.  Just like we might post-hoc rationalize most of our behaviors inaccurately, the same logic would apply here.  We might think we wear make-up or hit the gym because it makes us feel better, and we might persist in doing so even though no potential sexual partners are currently present or available - but the reason this makes us feel good in the first place is because of our internalized discomfort at being 'ugly' - a social construct that we likely appreciate and internalize in the first place because of our biology as it pertains to successful social interactions.   I.E you might wear make-up because it makes you feel good, but the reason it makes you feel good is a response to successfully manuevering social expectations and alleviating a desire for validation that is biologically rooted, without which you and your ancestors likely would not have performed particularly well in the evolutionary race.  It's well and good to object to poor usage and bad faith use of the argument for cosmetic pursuits being sexual driven by sophists like Jordan Peterson, but I don't think we're doing ourselves any favor responding to the reductionist and the most vaccuous version of an argument  if that entails making nearly as vaccuous objections in turn.   The response 'I, to my conscious knowledge, don't pursue beauty to attract others.' is just that - A vaccuous response."
"U just have to start eating a bunch of soy to bimbofy ur self"
"I'm East Asian and I have an experience many Asian girls have where their own parents pressure them from a young age to have cosmetic procedures. My mom used to make me pinch my nose every night (age 5), tell me that when I am old enough, I needed rhinoplasty and eyelid surgery. As an adult I'm still trying to recover from that. It's hard to separate how you feel about yourself and what other people are constantly telling you. People are especially rude about projecting their opinions onto trans people. It may not start out internally, but you can't help the way others plant the seed in your mind after years and years of constant comments."
"Whoah... I just realized how normal it is to get cosmetic surgery. I am getting an appointment right now, no more flacid belly for me."
"You still need to get your shoulders and back shrinked. maybe you're neck too. Don't know about the hands. The teeth too, would be good. If you do that, you'd be super cute.   Oh, yeah, I fogot. If you wanna get some ass implants I suggest you check Colombian doctors. Cheap and they're the most experienced with making cute prostitute dolls."
"She’s hilarious but really deep and smart. I love her and I don’t give a shit if she’s cute or not Hahaa"
"How did I not notice how funny, witty and intelligent you are when you debated Blaire?   Oof wish I knew this earlier cuz your videos are done so well, and you’re super likeable :)"
"My gender is Natalie dropping a casual 'bussy' while talking about revered artists"
"i was just thinking about this.  :)"
"I've never watched the woman before this video and I was definitely glad I did. Very interesting points"
"r/GamingCircleJerk 😉"
"I don't agree with the conclusion. I get that we may be better off personally by feeding into it because this is how society is today but trying to conform with the current beauty standards does the opposite of changing it. You say representation gets us forward yet you seem to support people with body dysmorphia getting plastic surgery when it's shown to have very little positive effects because the source of the anxiety is the obsessive nature of it."
""
"I get why it sounds like you deny the importance of beauty in today's society if you say you need to focus on other things but maybe you don't have a lot going for you in other areas if you start blaming your unhappiness or lack of success on your appearance. If you stop looking at celebrities or social media you will realize there are many conventionally unattractive or average people out there who are happy and successful because they play to their strengths and don't get discouraged because they have imperfections (as we all do in some area). I wouldn't have a problem with people having plastic surgery if they weren't obsessed with their appearance but I think that rarely happens and it just furthers peoples insecurities as you normalize it."
""
"The concept of 'passing' is misleading in itself. It's normal for your identity to be influenced by feedback from others but let's say 30% of people accept as you come out as trans without changing your appearance. then you wear makeup and 50% accept you. Then you have surgery and 70% of people accept you. At what point is it enough, because there will always be people who don't like you no matter what you become. If you can't take the one person calling you a freak once in a while then you're frankly fucked because you will never be accepted by everyone no matter who you are. Not least because you'll find yourself getting judged by other things than your appearance, and here you were, thinking everyone would like you because you were pretty."
""
"Maybe it's an unpopular take but at some point you need to accept that everyone is imperfect. Anyone that calls you out have their own insecurities they would hate to have called out. Even if you only cared about who wants to fuck you, a pretty face isn't the be-all and end-all of sex appeal so it would still be in your interest to take other things into consideration before coming to conclusions about the ultimate source of your unhappiness in life."
"'If I'm out of bed it's because I'm running late for something.'  God, that's a mood."

"Yo, if you’re a 6, things don’t look good for me."
"I can't stop laughing at 'HI, SISTERCELS!'"
"Sorry for being rude or anything. But are you a tran or what?"
"I don't know what to say... Such a great little post, tbh I think you are attractive to CIS men like me and I do think you look great if that helps. I hope you carry on with this great content for as long as you can, because I think it really can change people's minds."
"God... this was so good"
"They're biological sequins...Natalie, I love you."
"Nothing's wrong with wanting to be beautiful, just make sure you don't have a MELTDOWN like Brittany Venti's ex, 4Chad did.  'I LOOKED GOOD A YEAR AGO!!!!!!!!!!!!!' 'I'M SO BEAUTIFUL!!!!' 'MY BODY'S SO PERFECT!!!!' A textbook A L P H A M A L E"
"That prison woman is so resourceful. Fair play. It makes me as a cis bi guy want to know more about makeup, try it for myself, watch all these makeup channels."
"I love Gymnopedie, I also love Contrapoints"
"Powerful....Thank you...."
"I love how you started with a Sophie song in the intro. It's great to see trans women using other trans women's art in their own art."
"I’m still not convinced that makeup serves a function that can be separated from genetic advertisement. People may still wear makeup in contexts where they are not trying to flirt, but I believe that those environments are still competitive, whether or not we consciously recognise it.  Even if we are alone, changing our appearance in this way serves to confer a desired identity, and it wouldn’t be desirable if we weren’t answering to what we perceive as the market value of that identity.  I think it’s important to bear in mind the idea that people don’t actually “invent” anything. We just filter and recombine."
"HHHH THIS IS THE FIRST VIDEO I’VE SEEN OF YOURS AND YOURE S O F U N N Y"
"I’m not trans and never really had the money to actually try to be beautiful. Though your analysis and humor makes this so relatable. We all want to be beautiful but hate acknowledging it. Yet “loving yourself as you are” is what I strive for. Hearing it from a trans perspective was enlightening though."
"Disgusting  freak,  die"
"Hahaha. 'The straights'."
"Ok i've just unsubbed. Good luck fetishizing fucked-up beauty standards, i guess this is where trans actvism leads eventually."
"This is the first time I’ve seen one of your videos and I love it. I’m a hetero cis woman but I’ve gone through a lot of stages in which I either entirely reject or embrace feminine attributes. I used to never wear the color pink because I was afraid it’d make me look “too girly” (hi there, internalized misogyny). Right now I’m in a decent place because I’ve been able to be comfortable with both my musculine and feminine aesthetic likes and desires."
"Listen Girl! You're beautiful! Yeah you're always gonna think the opposite, but you do you and be the way you want to. You're pretty, you're beautiful. And yeah, the only person that can ever really make you feel better, is you."
"I too only think about Detective Pikachu"
"wow that work is fantastic"
"Thank you for this.  As an old cis broad, who peeked at a 7 at my best, I've been in quiet pain watching young trans folk wrestle with beauty=worthiness questions. The solitude of their struggle is what makes me weep. All fems go through this, each journey is painful. A yearslong fight to attain modicum of attractiveness only to have the ideals change just as you reach the old one, sending your esteem plummeting all over again. If I could impart advice to my young self? Work on the outside isnt work on the inside.   Make your outside pleasant to yourself, make your interior human someone whose thoughts you'll enjoy when you're old. They are actually two different journeys. Conflating them is a recipe for disaster. Beauty ideals are fluid, don't cast yours in stone. Take joy in makeup, skin care, shoes, etc. Shave a brow bone if you need to. Present yourself in a way that empowers, affirms, strengthens, but dont skimp on a healthy mind. Your interior self, who you really are, needs as much, actually more, daily maintenance than your skin. No one, trans or cis, stays sexually attractive forever. Working on your inner beauty every day is like saving for retirement. You will be rich when youth is just a memory.   Love to you all."

"I didnt initially catch the Fear and Loathing reference, but this video is apparently the gift that keeps giving."
"This video is wonderful, and has taught me a great deal. However, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the most important lesson of it. That message being, of course, that 'WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY.' Fin."
"Dear Natalie, you go through puberty as you said yourself. Well  all you experiencing is the definition of puberty. Being obsessed with your beauty, spending all your time trying to analyse wether you are pretty or not, feeling ugly and so on. That is how it was for most women. I had anorexia because of that. I would spend the hole day shopping to go to a party, just to stress like hell while getting ready, nearly crying not enjoying any second of it. BUT it will become better if you get older. Please dont do so many plastic surgeries while you are still in that state. I dont want know what I would have done if I had the money back then and would have been legally allowed to. It helps to get help of course, it is a very fucked up time, but it will change if everything goes well. You are hurting yourself mentally, imagine it like cutting yourself and try to stop it somehow when you see you are doing it again.  We love you, you are the best, please take care."
"I can't remember the last time I took more than a minute to get ready or even brushed my hair that wasnt my own wedding... I guess if I ever have a job interview (for a better position than I have now)I might have to do it again"
"*goes to check flabby arms*"
"I'm having a really hard time with the whole 'plastic surgery' deal and I wanna be ok with this so I can grow..like I'm shook.. can someone explain why I am so upset over contra getting plastic surgery? I feel entirely appalled by this new surgery. Is it because plastic surgery faces scare me and I feel uncomfortable with unnatural face mutilation... or am I missing some form of beauty in slicing your face off to fit societies unfair ideal of female beauty? I just wanna support but fuck dood... I'm kinda worried about contra now. I just really look up to you contra. I'm sorry for  feeling uncomfortable but I wanna understand."
"I hate beauty. Not make up, fashion, hair styling or anything like that, I actually like those; it's just this idea that you have to look a certain way, no matter what way it is; and it's because of this video, because people hurt themselves emotionally or physically just to achieve that look, be it women in the USA starving themselves to be thin or Mauritanian women being force-fed to be fat. I don't think it's wrong with being comfortable in your own body, but having these standards hurt people and I hate it"
"I used to be soooooo concerned with the way I looked. I would spend hours upon hours in the morning, getting up at 4am, just to put on a perfect makeup look, do my hair and pick out a great outfit. I would run around looking 'snatched', and the looks that I would get were the silent acknowledgment that I was seeking. Not the male attention.   I started a very, very time consuming university program 3 years ago. Since then, I have noticed my efforts for beauty and style going down slowly but steadily. I will go out with glasses, minimal makeup and random clothes from my drawer, because I'm way too busy and my mind is eay too occupied with other, more important things. And I honestly have never felt better about my appearance. No longer do I spend 3 hours every day getting ready. Instead, I devote that energy and time to things that actually matter to me. Learning. Growing. Making changes.   When I was in high school, I was a very good student. I was interested in the things I was learning, and liked to go beyond just the school material. But I wasn't really challenged. The fact of the matter is, if you have time to spend 3 hours a day on your looks, it's because you're not stimulated otherwise.   I am a maths and physics major, and like you, I often struggled with the way women in academia view women who dress very femininely. At first I felt the same way as you - it must be internalised sexism, right? Wearing pants suits and square glasses instead of mini skirts and oversize shades has got to be an attempt to look more masculine, RIGHT? Well, over the course of the past few years, I have become that pants suit and square glasses wearing girl, and I DO find overdressed women at the university a bit funny. And the reason is that I feel that if someone (guy or girl) puts more time and resources into something relatively meaningless like makeup or hair cuts, they cannot be taking their acacemic career TOO seriously. I know this from personal experience."

"The sequin ASMR was totally working for me XD"
"I love your channel. I’ve literally “shared” many of your videos with professors trying to open an honest dialogue about many social justice issues. I’d really like your take on the sort of elephant in the room regarding transgender athletes competing against biological women in competitive sports.  This is a topic that came up during one of my social/economic advocacy courses in school and even the professor was a little conflicted about what the appropriate response might be. I, myself, am in the same boat. Know it’s a shot in the dark, but would love to hear your take on this. A potentially contrarian video linked below.  https://youtu.be/NIlq85dL0C4"

"Does anyone know what the background music is around the 23:00 minute mark?"
"I think im a man but lately i've been in a sort of an identity crisis. I've had somewhat an afinity for the idea of me being a woman but ive always wrote it off as a sexual fetish and thought theres no way i could be trans because i didn't completely hate my body. But I now I honestly don't know and im afraid that if I do come to the conclusion that im trans and then come out that I could be wrong and end up regretting it. One of the problems is that before this time i had never even thought about for example peoples use of pronouns. But now i really don't know"
":? I'm still confused. I... guess I don't understand contemporary beauty much. Like you said in your capitalism video 'joining the clone army' doesn't really click for me. It's too cold and too sharp. Where's the softness, the warmth, the realness?"
"That intro is everything."
"Maybe you could watch Teal Swan, many points of accepting oneself reminded me of her"
"What are your opinions on brands like Glossier that market the idea that less is more for makeup whatnot? 17:09 I don't why I love this bit so much."
"CHOKE ME MOMMY"
"I've considered getting facial feminization surgery eventually. I'm glad to Contrapoints has shown how good the results can be. It's unfortunate that she seems unaware that aging can eventually be reversed."
"Natalie, you have a really nice sense of fashion! That dress is so cute. The best thing you can do for yourself is understand that you are beautiful regardless of makeup, I've spent too much time on doing 'Perfect' makeup and disregarded that I'm pretty, and that personality is good and that I can always improve."

"Correct me if im wrong. But is the conclusion here that Contra feels ugly and its societies fault?  I came here aftwr hearing Contra praised as a bastion of leftist philosophy only to find an insecure  hypocrit who still hasnt figured out the most basic life lessons. So disappointed."
"Well I know you won't see this, but maybe someone else will, you'll never feel beauty till... YOU decide you're beautiful, or more so discover that inner love already existing within you. Relying on outside validation is an illusion, you are the only one who cares about your beauty, and trying to satisfy others so they'll then satisfy you with compliments is.... Just a really complicated way of going about it 😅"

You are a very smart, funny, person who has may of the same opinions I do, and so I think of your as more beautiful than if you were some unfunny right-wing idiot."
"The fucking funniest thing is that I saw you without makeup for the first time today and I'd honestly have to say: I think you pass MORE without makeup and you are even prettier without makeup. And this coming from a casual viewer who understands the struggle of fake ass compliments but who also really does like your makeup in this video, sooooo...."

"I can relate to a lot of this video. I've always struggled with the fact that I'm ugly and it's one of the many reasons why I wish I were a man. It affects so many parts of my life that I sometimes wish I had the courage to truly accept my ugliness. You know, shave nothing but my own head (I have hirsutism, which makes me look like a manly freak), stop wearing makeup and hair products, grow fatter, etc. I'd still hate myself, but at least I wouldn't waste my time, money and energy trying to change the unchangeable. Too bad that I'm not brave enough to do that."

"okkkkkkkkkkkkay why is this the best video ever brought into fruition..... this resurrected all my dead brain cells"
"I don't think that anyone wants to be beautiful for beauty's sake.  It's not about aesthetics, it's about power.  Seeking to be beautiful is to seek to have power over others or to feel powerful within one's self.  If beauty were enough of an aim within itself, there would be no standards to adhere to, there would be something beautiful to find in any direction you'd care to look in.  It's like that Twilight Zone episode, The Eye of the Beholder, where the power was held by people who we would consider to be mutant and ugly.  It's really all about power.  If you don't connect to the sense of being powerful within yourself, there is no aesthetic enhancement you can make that will fully satisfy.  People who are most able to move others with their beauty and who are themselves moved by their own beauty are people who have connected to this power.  You can't work in from the surface.  You have to start from within by knowing that you are powerful and that your beauty is a reflection of that, not by hoping to create power within yourself by trying to be beautiful."
"That intro is amazing. It terrifies me as well."
"About the time I start wondering 'huh, what's ContraPoints up to,' you'll release a beautifully edited, thoughtful video that reminds me why I'm OK waiting until the cows come home.  Your eyeshadow is fucking fantastic by the way, my lord."
"20:09 Pretty."
"I keep thinking about how Contrapoints chose to colour-coordinate her eyeshadow with the bruising in the post-op footage. It's a brilliant use of feminine aesthetic as an artful expression of meaning.   Also I got an ad for plastic surgery at the start of this video. Such smart little algorithms we've got on this internet of ours."
"'because patriarchy'... Yeah, that convinces me so much, because women want to be beautiful because men program them to, lol?"
"You are incredible and I loved this video~ you look like Keira knightly"

"i love all your videos and your blend of critical theory, humor, and psychoanalysis. i have learned from you and that is invaluable! i wish you peace along your journey and am sending you love and acceptance ([{*~~*+++*~~*}])"
"That dismissive, self-bashing humour is how I used to handle my depression; I hope it's not the case for you. It doesn't matter what else i say or what i think of how you look (pretty, for anyone wondering, but then again i didn't think you ugly before either), but please keep people close, try to have a good support system and don't hesitate to reach out for help.  Even though i don't agree with you on a lot of things i want everyone to be happy as long as they don't harm others. Good luck and i hope you find a way to feel satisfied with yourself."
"To me the societal pressure to be beautiful is unbreakable, history and mythology (across various cultures) are littered with examples of BEAUTY (male, female, non-binary). It's probably biological since we climbed down from the trees and lost our body hair. *shrug* As someone almost 40 (internal screeching), I don't wear make-up and I have the audacity to feel all sad and doomed-spirally when I look awful in pictures. It's entertaining. Anyway, you look great (and 'natural', le sigh). I am gonna miss your nose though."
"Thank you for the video.  Natalie I am going to ask a question, sorry if my premises are off  :)  You were perceived as an attractive man,  and I imagine you were struggling with body dis-morphia and shit,  But I would imagine that you did get from society a fair amount of 'You look Great you fair skinned, thin, hunk of man, who is also smart and talented, what a catch you are'  So my  question is:  Was being 'Attractive' a hindrance  to self acceptance and transitioning?   Yes I am a fan, who thinks you look beautiful! And while I am struggling with my own aging and mortality,  when I see a race realist try to hide their fear of videos posted by a transwoman,  I do get all wet, and giddy like a school girl!"
"the only struggle is class struggle, gamers rise up"
"This video is exactly what I needed after days of compulsively watching beauty influencers on Youtube. It is correct on every level."
"Journey!…   👏Jour👏ney👏"
"Hey Natalie, I'm currently watching through a backlog of your videos and I love them and sometimes while watching them I feel like crying in relief that you exist and give your point with an honest transparency and good humour that I have not been able to find anywhere. You're fucking amazing."
"As an aside, there were moments when you had a Winona Ryder look about you. I don't know why, it's just the vibe I was getting. I really enjoyed your video!"
"I see you walked back on your Satie critique"
"Is there anyone else who gets the rocky horror picture show vibes from ContraPoints’s videos ?     *And loves it*"
"Please allow to say that you have beautiful eyes. I find your natural self to be very attractive. @ 21:53 Cheers!"
"also, if it means anything, you most definitely pass. if you hadn’t mentioned it i would literally never have realized you were trans when i first started watching your videos"
"everything you said hit so close to home...very refreshing to hear someone voice the exact same concerns that i have"
"Not gonna lie the video loving nerd in me is loving the phrase Skin Maxing, luckily as a trademarked trans folk i can use it ironicly ;D"
"I am a tall, balding man with a lot of body hair, and I often worry about my looks and wish I could be more beautiful. I love the way removing the body hair allows me to feel my skin, and feel more with my skin, although the cost and effort of both removing the hair and dealing with the damage this does to the skin means I can't maintain it permanently. I like to be able to look in the mirror and think I look good, regardless of what anyone else thinks about my looks (although it is nice to catch someone checking me out, too). Of course, if I try too hard to look and feel good, when I'm in public I will be treated as though I have broken some natural law of manhood, because that's supposed to be feminine behaviour. I've even been physically attacked by complete strangers that didn't like the clothes or make-up I was wearing.  Does any of this mean I am suffering gender dysphoria? No, it just means some people are arseholes, and no good can come from worrying about what they think. Know thyself, and to thine own self be true.  Arohanui!"
"You look really beautiful. Awesome video as always. Looking forward to the next one. Was talking just today about social media and dismorphia. Social media makes people sick"
"Thanks for this"

"Hey, big fan, but you completely misunderstood what Jordan Peterson meant because whether or not a man has an opinion that they prefer women having no makeup, they subconsciously like someone who accentuates their features to look prettier. Some are so into the females who wear makeup that they don't even think that they're actually wearing it or care less about it because it stimulates their senses. Males are visual, if you're going to let them judge the surface, they will.  You seem biased here, I don't listen to Jordan Peterson that much but I pretty much understood what he meant. It's the same with any other person who CAN'T CHOOSE who or what they'll be attracted to (gays, bisexual, skinny, plump, bisexuals, etc).   I'm a female myself, and even I think makeup is like a cheat to the system. I don't have a problem with it if you're going to wear it on special occasions, but to wear it every day is pretty much like a mask."
"Best face mask is yogurt and ground up oats (not cooked) and honey. Mix it up into a paste and put it on your face for at least 5 minutes. It makes your face really soft. I love it. I am lazy so I rarely do it, but I found out that some yogurt brands are now making oats and honey yogurt, so I tried that and it also worked. Maybe not as well, but who cares. It's better than mixing my own just once a year because I'm lazy. I recommend it."
"Yeah, I waited many days to watch this cos I 'wasn't in the right cis mood', and frankly I'm amazing and wise, cos this was both a) the right time and b) everything. I felt targeted, personally attacked and fully educated. Whatever you choose to do with your looks, and however you feel about them going forward, I'm just so grateful that you continue to make my life better. Of course it doesn't mean much, but I've always thought you were very nice to look at. Mostly I've been impressed by your work and blown away by your insight. So. Sorry bout it."
"That dress is SO GOOD WHERE DID IT COME FROM OMG"
"9:43  I was dead at “camgirl”"
"You look very beautiful... you should try going out without makeup and i bet you still won't get misgendered. This may help with your beauty struggle. You looked particularly cute in the mirror (when you were doing your beauty routine) i hope you don't have any more surgery, it does get addictive and you said you cannot judge your own looks. Please remember that."
"you are 100% correct that the changes to your self image cannot come from the outside."
"You know, as a straight dude, I actually do think you look good.  I know it's a bit sexist to say, but I could see me trying to talk to you at a bar. It looks good, keep doing what feels good for you."
"Also a few other things: 1. You ARE NOT a 6. You are AT LEAST an 8 and I would not lie to you I’m not a hardcore fan. I am a 6 and you do NOT get to take that from me.  2. When you were talking about toner I laughed so hard I almost peed. 3. I struggle with wanting to be beautiful and critiquing myself for critiquing myself as well and really appreciate this video."
"I quite liked your nose"
"The production quality of these videos has gotten so high   also shoutout to sophie"
"Things I worry with more women having surgery to get the perfect chin cheeks nose etc. We will all basically look the same."
"I would bet a lot of money that you live in Hampden!"
"You are gorgeous - before and after. huge fan!"
"Never have I felt better about being uglier than sin. I haven't even tried makeup yet but all this toner and mist and concealer and more mist and all those brushes...it's so daunting that I feel relieved to not have to bother with it."
"esse canal é genial"
"Natalie, (and others which this applies) I work in the maxillofacial  surgical field. Post surgical depression is in fact, a very normal post-operative complication, and it is compounded by a number of factors, some of which you addressed here.  Take care of yourself, try to be gentle with yourself, and you feel overwhelmed, do not hesitate to reach out for help. To Natalie, thank you for your educational, insightful and inspirational videos. Your efforts are very appreciated."
"Seems kinda selfish not to donate that shaved off chin bone to some needy incel."
"I've said it before and I'll say it again: contrapoints asmr now pls"
"OMG SOPHIE"
"why am i sexually attracted 2 u... rip"
"Natalie you are smart, gorgeous, fun, inspiring, and I love you with or without sequins or facial surgery, production value or sweat pants.  I love you for your intelligent insight and artistic integrity.  You are a fucking champion.  You go girl.  Much love!"
"a e s t h e t i c a l l y   f e m a l e ?"
"I think you were more attractive before. I guess I don't understand how's like living in the wrong body"
"That moment you have to be reminded that Natalie isn't a cis woman."
"'Right now you guys are kind of getting in the way of my crudely stereotyping people based on gender.'   ( -(ｴ)-)ゞ  Yes, ma'am! That's part of our job, ma'am!   Ahh, I just love your videos. <3"
"SOPHIE just BTEC Death Grips"
"Thank you for uploading this.   I only discovered your channel today but your videos make me feel great when I’ve finished watching them."
"*checks self* yep, still gay for ya"
"Natalie, you are like the most beautiful person without makeup. Like, you have this pure nature look to you, like an etherial goddess."
"Where I just sit there and contemplate the futility of my struggle against the ravages of time I screamed same bitch same"
"intro song is fucking rad"
"Just got ear raped a minute in the video"
"Nat, I'm a cis fem lesbian, who only fancies other fem women, you are as fine as hell, no joke. I think you're hot, and I also though so before your surgery. Please PM me, Dark Mother. Or marry Philosophy Daddy. Thank you. I love you. x x x x x x x x"
"awesome video, (laughed so hard at the nonbinary joke i started coughing) but ending on the power personal style has was such a great note to end on and was something i found especially relatable as a person interested in basically every alternative fashion under the sun. fashion was a reclamation of my body and how i choose to be perceived and once i really found my style i started actually recognizing myself in the mirror and liking what i saw"
"SIS. THIS SEQUINS NUMBER. also.. I caught that H.S.Thompson reference around 21 mins,...."
"It reminds me of me at 13 where vanity was everything, and I was drowning in insecurity because of puberty. I survived...."
"Too afraid to watch this, scared of the fatphobia"
"this video is all over the place. you should take a therapist instead of pouring your insecurities in a smart fashion on the web"
"Or maybe women wear makeup because it's a social status thing and they fight mostly through gossip so you wouldn't want to be the target of other inmates. Man, you videos used to be smart, now you're just playing a disguised victim card."
"'You should be grateful I am wearing clothes at all'  Girl, you clearly don't realise how sincere some of the comments are."
"Lmao I thought this was gonna be a metal song and music video  I thought contrapoints was a band or something"
"LMAO LMAO LMAO STARFISH NIGHT by Vincent Van Gogh....note, though....Gogh has the H sound in front, too....."
"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Actually not period,  exclamation point."
"Except you totally can change your thought processes and stop giving a fuck to some degree. How many vegans suffer from a constant temptation to eat meat? How many antinatalists feel an uncomfortable desire to have children? Conditioned or innate, those are fairly base impulses that a lot of people seem to arrest. Hopefully you get back to more interesting subjects and kick this Dorian Gray shit."
"This isn't flattery, but I genuinely think you're hot as hell. Like seriously, you're incredibly beautiful."
"Lesbian obsessed work appearance, I blame it on LA!"
"I just had to say your makeup - both your skin and eyes - looks amazing in this!  you're glowing. & also your eyebrows are lovely. and I love that shiny colorful dress/top!"
"I hope my username doesn’t undermine my words when I say that ya look hella fine even without the make up"
"So did you guys watch the new HBO series Chernobyl? Episode 4 when they poor those dead dogs into the pit with that Russian song playing in the background......shit was CHILLING>"
"Thank you I love you"
"The best aspect of this video is that she correctly pronounces Van Gogh and I love her for it"
"You are the most quotable person ever, I stan a fucking hero"
"You're over-intellectualising your feelings."
"You think you could make a video on Transathletes? Since this whole RR drama unravelled the misconceptions have exploded."
"A part of the problem why she cares so much about her appearance is probably also that as a she now, diffferent from the women in academia, makes a living in part from her looks. Like the intro: Her face is the shop front of her videos, its what other people see first in the thumbnail. YouTube is about visuals not smarts. I do feel sorry, that she cares so much  about her appearance. Its a field where you can never get even close to 'perfect', its an unsatisfying endless cycle."
"Ily contra you’re a trans icon but how many drugs are you on when you edit your videos?"
"Christina Aguilera beautiful starts playing"
"I’ve been made fun of most of my life for looking/being androgynous. In person & online, even at 36 years old. I don’t WANT to have long hair. I don’t WANT to shave most of the time, but I barely have body hair. My own face I guess sorta acts like a filter that finds out who is a shallow piece of shit not worth my time."
"To me this video is a further step in the bone chirurgy of our society."
"I really love this video and your honesty, I feel it. This is the second video of yours I have ever watched and I actually don't care much about the whole visual part of it,  could just listen to you as a podcast and from min 22:30 on someting within me would start going 'true', 'truer!', 'TRUEST'. Thanks!!"
"You *do* look 'cunty' though. I love it."
"Lesbians are chillin' 👌"
"So I'm studying to become a forensic anthropologist which is a fancy way of saying I study bones. Biologically speaking we all look at bones to find a mate. And we don't even realize we do it. That being said I am also a cisgender female and I can honestly say that being in a, while not male-dominated subfield, a male-dominated field I don't necessarily wear makeup I don't really put effort into my hair and I almost never get my nails done. On the flip side of that I love makeup tutorials and I love nail tutorials and I even watch some hair videos. I never feel pretty enough to do any of them. I've always felt like I'm the ugly friend in the group. the way I'm going to say this might sound crude, even though you're trans and I'm cis-gendered you actually made me feel at home. I feel not alone for the first time in a while. and I'm definitely going to subscribe to your channel because if the rest of your videos are like this then I will love them. You made me feel like not a freak"
"I mean, you could learn cognitive behavioral modification techniques and remake your sense of beauty, but you could also drive yourself insane with those techniques..."
"The artistry... I wasnt ready"
"Every time I see you, you look more and more like a young Winona Rider. Oh, and you're smart too, but is that even important for a girl? ;)"
"Not gonna lie, I high key miss Tabby now."
"i remembered to buy Linda William's 'Hardcore' while i watched this shit....? dont analyze me"
"ContraPoints just becomes a sequins-based ASMR channel after this video"
"We LiVe In A sOcIeTy"
"Great video but was kind of bummed that you said cis women not wearing makeup is a 'not like other girls' flex. why do you believe this? I wear very light makeup if any and I dress pretty butch. This is about preference and has nothing to do with thinking I'm more sophisticated than other girls. wearing feminine clothing and makeup feels uncomfortable for me, as it does for lots of women. you're talking about fluidity and style and yet you're low key condemning a gender non-conforming behavior as being self righteous?"
"I don't need to look at thousands of hours of my own face on camera to hate myself, it takes one glance in the mirror lol"
"I love Natalie's honesty: she wants to look beautiful. Sue her."
"...as soon as you began to mention cultivating personal style, I immediately thought of Frida Kahlo, who not only had painful physical issues, but the obvious unibrow, and yet, that unibrow and her artistic renditions of her painful physical conditions made her a serious hottie!   I subscribed to your channel two minutes in to watching one of your older videos for the first time a couple months ago ( that was randomly suggested for me by youtube).  I liked you before and I like you after surgery. you being you is what makes you a serious hottie!"
"I always thought you looked gorgeous because of the way you carry yourself and speak, but in general you were a very good-looking woman. I would have said that you wouldn't need any facial surgery, and that you were very attractive if not in a completely conventional fashion. Honestly, though, the minor changes made by the surgery are fantastic. Not so much that I would ever assume surgical intervention, but just enough to really make you shine that little bit more.  You would have been our gorgeous Natalie either way, but Jesus, you look great."
"The first video I saw by you, on Incels - which I entered knowing nothing of you - I had no idea  you were transgendered, and you didn't mention it until quite late (if at all) in that vid, so it came as a surprise. I just accepted you as female... for whatever that's worth!"
"I was never really touched by the beauty stick. More of a handsome looking effeminate boy. In my youth! A Grandma at my advanced age of over, way over 30. A grandma without children. So a Spinster!"
"Really agree with your point on having representative beauty icons. Nice recent example I saw was Spiderman Homecoming having it's school crush / love interest characters dark skinned, which I really dug. Also great vid overall!"
"Does this count as political satire? I don't laugh at political satire normally, but this is good."
"That's a thought. I only wear make-up for special occasions. People would look at me like ' Did you cut your hair' I be like no I just put on some concealer, liner, and lipstick. Basicly the natural makeup look. I just recently started posting pictures on twitter and facebook of my face. Its weird getting compliments with no makeup on. I just make sure my face is washed and no crusties. No Filter! Maybe some glasses filters for special occasions. I have been more active in losing inches because of my youtube videos."
"Forgiving yourself for wanting to be beautiful... Thank you for that."
"The issue is that many people believe that the lack of warmth, love and community in their life is due to their shortcomings. So they equate feelings of emptiness with things like not looking good enough. When really, it’s the lack of warmth, love, and community in your life that is making you so critical of yourself. I started working in a group home, spreading love with all the people I work with, and I have come to think I am physically beautiful as a result of this major life change. (Previously I worked in an office and always felt disconnected from others)"
"SOPHIE nice"
"You do look better, but you still looked good even before. The surgeon did a really good job; the changes are subtle and natural looking. I'm not really into makeup myself, but I do love when people do really extravagant styles;  really shows off some nice artistic talent. * v*  I had no idea about dudes looking for face masc surgeries. Don't know why that never crossed my mind.  Sounds like a bad spiral to go down; sorry there's nothing I, or anyone, can say to help beat that mindset back like the roach infestation it is."
"Babe, you need some Zen"
"I fucking love the sequins visually and also the asmr ness"
"watches this 90 times for the intro alone"
"Dismiss it was fannish flattery, but you do look good and that was a very pretty top. :)"
"CELINE. DION."
"In other words, this is all an excuse to wear sequins, fuck yeah!"
"I am straight, happily married to a biological woman, father of daughters, and I find your videos useful and informative.  I find you beautiful, even before surgery.  Thank you for what you do, and yes....you are beautiful more than once a month.  :)"
"I'm a married cis gender man of questionable sexual orientation and I must say that you are almost unnervingly attractive both pre and post op. Feel good about yourself yo!"
"Her smile at 17:16 is the cutest thing I've ever seen"
"You're too smart for me, but I love you anyway."
"Cant lie couldn't even tell contra was a trans person until they said so in one video. Just figured he/she was a hot chick."
"25:12 I simply love Gymnopedie No. 1!"
"Damn Nat... you look amazing!"
"Hi Natalie & youtube, I agree with your points. I think woman in general suffer from a kind of 'dysphoria' feeling like they are trying to look like an ideal woman. There is an unacknowledged MORAL pressure to be beautiful as woman, and not just beautiful, but in reality, match the valued features of this society by obtaining what is viewed as rare and right--- it's not being pretty--- it's about looking like a certain face, a certain person-- and you're right, if you try, you're viewed as shallow, but most woman have absorbed to some degree through advertisement, the way woman talk about other woman, the way men judge women for 'trying too hard' but laud the 'naturally beautiful' or those who are subtly trying without being obvious... the intense pressure and self-hatred that drives women to wear make-up (some women wear make up for fun or not out of shame but lets acknowledge the woman who feels embarrassed to be in public without it or else they feel unattractive or unworthy of respect), the woman with eating disorders, the woman who shave their natural leg hair, pubes, get boob jobs, vagionaplasties, change their noses, adam's apples (I'm a cis woman with a larger adam's apple... watching your video made it occur to me that you pre-FFS looked similar to me-- I have Jewish heritage that gives me a small bump in the nose, I have a slightly more visible adam's apple), their lips (mine are slightly thinner)... not to look Beautiful but to looks like the image of a certain woman they think they have to be to be 'the beautiful woman'-- in society we relate to these few who fit these beauty standards not even as though they are more attractive, because there are soooo many ways to be beautiful, but with envy.... I've always found you attractive and feminine. In my mind FFS didn't make you more 'female' it made you just a slightly different woman, because, there are so many ways to be a woman. What you are experiencing is what many woman experience-- the rejection of their features. My small lips, my larger labia, my small bumb in the nose.... this miniscule thing about us is wrong-- naturally hairier woman for example, middle eastern women perhaps, may feel shame over hairy arms, eyebrows, or bellies, woman ashamed over their smaller hips or breasts or larger bellies, their lack of thigh gap or smaller butt.... I agree that trans people when experiencing a transition may be giving language to their gender dsyphoria without realizing what they are entering into his the female experience of continual self-rejeciton. In reality, like you said, woman have hair, not all woman are beautiful , there are so many ways to be beautiful, some women look masculine or androgynous and men and woman are still attracted to them... the thing you and many are entering into isn't about being womanly but perhaps the worst part of being female in this culture--- and that's why rich trans people like Caitlyn Jenner or perhaps Laverne Cox I feel are given a level of acceptance by society because they don't just transition to a female appearance, they transition t the 'right' female appearance that most normally won't ever achieve without plastic surgery and cosmetics.... perhaps you've already read Naomi Wolf's book 'The Beauty Myth' talking about how all women are trying to become the form of 'the iron maiden', an image of a woman they torture themselves trying to become..... when woman are still beautiful with all their variations... but we aren't taught to think that. Most woman have a 'dysphoria'-- I relate to your videos even though I'm not trans, and I always have--- someone asked me, why do you care so much about being beautiful... I don't know, because if I'm not, I feel I am viewed by others as worthless... a deep need and despair I can't really rationalize, that I also don't want. And it pains me to see you and other woman feeling the same way, and it pains me to talk to others who don't understand how it feels, like the men I date... what is my point? I don't know. I guess I just wanted to point out how all woman are taught to hate themselves."
"lol--trans pride eye makeup <3"
"Hey Contra, I really loved this video and your insight as always. I can't say I have the same experiences struggling with beauty, since I'm not trans, but I do relate to the fact that as a woman, even as a chubby, queer, belligerent feminist and self-proclaimed intellectual, so much of me still just wants to be pretty. You wouldn't know it looking at me since I barely ever wear make up (originally because of internalized misogyny/'I'm not like other girls phase,' but now it's just pure laziness) and I don't often dress well. But a lot of this is because I do care about how I look and the lack of effort is because I've given up and see my appearance as a lost cause. While I know intellectually this doesn't make me any more or less of a person, emotionally I still hate looking at myself in photos and just wish I could somehow become beautiful. For what it's worth, I do think you are a beautiful woman (with an excellent sense of aesthetics). But I also think that my opinion about your or anyone else's looks shouldn't carry that much weight."
"So let's ignore your great speech and talk about those gorgeous nails."
"A hair implant commercial starts before the beginning of this video... Hmm... 🤔"
"Hmmm..something tells me this was about a journey..."
"23:43 👏👏👏"
"I like the joke with the sunscreen, especially because it is the only thing that would actually stop or at least slow down skin aging instead of all that other shit. And yes r/iamverysmart"
"My trick is to get a shitter mirror and less intense lighting. It does wonders for my self esteem."
"Im cis and thank you for helping me be a better woman"
"23:43-23:46 Feels and power to anyone who feels that way, even if they don't ponder if doing practising many self-portraits to practise art well means narcissism, automatically. Loved the 'defiance of death' part."
"As a straight man I can confirm she asked all of us.  Wow, I’m shocked by the popularity of me literally reaching for the lowest hanging fruit for a joke. Wit is hard you guys."
"I got 3 stitches"
"STYLE."
"i've been through the same. it sucks, man."
"Style! Yes!!!! Thank you for this meaningful video and thay beautiful conclusion! To me you are beautiful."
"I didnt really expect this one to hit me close to home but it did. I don't know what to say except that I really appreciate you. Your persona, your sincerity, even the frustration and turmoil you go through in every video trying to sort things out that are way too complicated. You're nailing it. Thanks for being sharing it."
"I just discovered your channel and I can't get enough! Look, I hate people that give unsolicited advice, but I'm going to do it anyway, because I can't help my sister...please continue to try and quit drinking. My sister...she's in end stage liver disease. But it's the loss of her mind that freaks me out the most. She has no short term memory and every time she gets drunk (which is everyday), she enters this fantasy world that is so annoying. If only we were all drunk, I guess. It's getting more and more difficult to tolerate the craziness. And like you, she started drinking when she was about five years old. Stop now, while you can. Please."
"I’m too poor to beautify myself 😭"
"Jesus, you and your video production quality are gorgeous!"
"I just love your videos :) <3"
"'biological sequines' then 'that is some asmr' 🤣😂 you are amazing and beautiful and so goddamn insightful. Don't doubt it  I like what you do, makeup, no makeup, whether you view yourself as beautiful or not."
"You are just coming into your own and its so amazing to see, it's beautiful, you're beautiful all around. Your videos just keep getting better and better, too. Thank you for this much needed perspective! Also, I gotta say lesbians are not straight chilling. We are very much in with the rest of humanity, not straight chillin lol"
"I'm a tomboyish lesbian. When I look in the mirror, it doesnt feel like I'm looking at myself so I'm like 'Damn, she cute' but then when I realise it is me, I'm like 'Ew.'  I dont wear makeup or dress feminine. I want to get a breast reduction surgery and just be Average looking with like a Size C. I only find myself wanting to be pretty or feminine if that's what my gal pals want, otherwise I just wanna be comfortable. Beauty is weird and ya gotta do you to feel like yourself and be comfortable."
"Hi Contra, check out 'Beauty Sick' by Renee Engeln, unless you already did or you do not appreciate 😉"
"Good music taste"
"Don't skip sunscreen if you're going out. It may in a long run be more important than the rest. And you do look beautiful with and without make up."
"Cis female here I was raised super awkwardly I never learned to dress for my body or do my hair! And my body hair is a lot it has taken such a toll on my mentality sometimes it feels like its not my body."
"I'm big fan of yours but as a S T R A I G H T  C I S   M A L E   I honestly think you're pretty. Like if you told me you are trans, I'd believe it unquestionably and if you told me you are a cis woman I'd believe it unquestionably"
"that Wordsworth quote really hit!! It's something I've noticed with my creative writing. The things I want to write don't really have a mainstream demand, and it took me a while to realize your stories don't have to follow pre-established expectations in published literature. The characters, the world, the themes, all of it can be exactly what YOU relate to and find appealing"
"They pulled her face off???"
"Just spotted @WEATHERISHAPPEN in the credits. I will watch this crossover. Tabby has a lot to say about UR OLIGARX."
"NEVER SKIP THE SUNSCREEN"
"I love the incel jokes"
"you look like simone giertz"
"'I'm not a bimbo: I'm a poet'  😂 RIP"
"In my eyes the way to change society is to change yourself. If my ideals are right, I can't just tell people that, I need to live to those ideals and show them how good it can be. Despite having a wildly different point of view, these ContraPoints videos are so enjoyable to me because it feels like you're doing the same. The mixture of strong opinion, brutal honestly and a clear eyed view of yourself is what allows someone like me who thinks so differently to feel so at home listening to what you're saying."
"See, I'm not a bimbo, I'M A POET"
"maybe we're not supposed to feel beautiful by ourselves? maybe people that loves us are supposed to make us feel beautiful?"
"thank you for your honesty, as always. i think as women we feel trapped in our desire to be beautiful more than men do, because history has given great importance to female beauty over brains. women such as marilyn monroe or cleopatra, who are remembered and probably will be for a long time as icons of feminity, are reputed for their beauty, regardless of their power or talent. a woman who has managed to impact the world despite not being seen as beautiful is rarely remembered by her face. i doubt any of us have a clear image of what marie curie looks like. furthermore, women get forgotten as they age bc of the idea that beauty fades with time. i once read a quote that said something along the lines of, when men like elvis or kennedy die, there are always reported sightings and claims that they are in fact still alive. but when a woman like marilyn monroe dies young, people never doubt it. because they don't want to find her having become old. and that's just so deeply set into our brains, that as women we must possess beauty before anything else, and once that fades, we might as well die. cis or trans, the stakes might be different, but all women share this incredibly powerful idea. beauty is our personal god. and i think men just don't understand that. i don't even think many women realize just how much we are influenced by it. there was once a survey asking women and girls if they'd rather lose an arm or gain a lot of weight and almost all of them said lose an arm. that's just womanhood. beauty over function. beauty over self. beauty over life. would you rather die right now or live a hundred years looking ugly? would you rather be twice your weight and have the career of your dreams or struggle to pay rent and be skinny? would you rather be called a bitch or fat? we must all ask ourselves what kind of image we have of ourselves and what self respect really means. i fear for the future of women and girls. i hope my daughter never has to feel the way i do. anyway… you are a smart woman, as you know it, and you have the power to influence many people. i think it's great you made this video bc it forces us to reflect upon an uncomfortable problem we are all facing. so thank you."
"You left out reason three - they genuinely get no pleasure out of makeup or other forms of conventional femininity, not because they hate women or womanhood but because it just doesn't appeal to them at all. Seriously, can we not add on to this whole all women are innately draw to high femme and those who say they aren't are lying misogynists thing?"
"I’ve learned so much from your videos.  The content and quality are always top notch. I can tell you put a lot of effort into them. Keep it up."
"What's the tech reason that mirror contra seemed to be moving slower than regular contra?"
"every one of ur videos has at least one iconic quote that i think about for a long time after watching and i love u more every video i watch how do u do it queen"
"I always said that fashion can be bought but style only comes from within"
"Sometimes, I think it's good that I have horrible eczema and localized scleroderma. It means that I worry about serious medical things that are wrong with me rather than worrying if my pores are a little too big. hahahahahahahaha fml"
"This is almost written as parody."
"Wait can someone explain why Contra keeps dropping 'fish' in parts of the video almost at random. Is this a meme? What am i missing people?"
"That intro😍😍"
"I'm getting a little tired of this bitch flitting between ethics and aesthetics. It's boring and self indulgent"
"This whole video is just ContraPoints rationalizing her neurotic impulses relating to her looks."
"I love when the video colors invert and because of the lights your irises look like skulls.  It's the small things for me."
"Growing up with both parents in academia... I always felt like the women didn't care so much about beauty because they just didn't have time. They were too involved in their work and it just wasn't all that important. Maybe it's different for people in universities now, but it just didn't seem to be about appearing masculine, or different from other women at all."
"I've been watching your channel for only about six months. For the record, in all that time, I always thought you were gorgeous, and I think the changes (they are subtle but very effective) have kept you looking like you  only *more* gorgeous.  The thing is, its easier to look beautiful more effortlessly if you have confidence and if your surgery has helped you gain confidence, then you're going to find it more and more easy to look beautiful. As someone whose own mother thinks she's 'just not that pretty, but at least you've got a brain' I think I know a little bit about not being able to judge my own appearance, but I've found that the main issue is that I see the remnants of my teenage face (which was NOT pretty because I was all nose) and can't see past it (pun intended). I expect you still see the remnants of your old face in the one you have now and so you still feel like you've not succeeded as a woman. I 'm sure all your fans (and I count myself among them) don't see that, we see you as you are now, a beautiful intelligent woman. And you can use both your beauty and intelligence in any way you like. Whilst I hope that you continue talking about the kinds of things you've brought up for the last year or so (I haven't watched much before that) if you find another route, i'm sure most of us will still watch your channel because you are so compelling as a creator."
"Not gonna lie, you had me in that intro. Thanks for letting us into this process at all, you certainly didn't *owe* us any vlog."
"gorl you might not feel beautiful but at least you're skinny so clothes will fit you more easily and you got that going on for you, I don't so yas superior queen whatever"
"I've watched this video so many times for that into alone. The rest of the video is very good too of course."
"“The Aquarium” playing over footage of Jordan Peterson. I see what you did there"
"i love how self aware you are, your such a fucking awesome personality, i hope all the best xo"
"Honestly I know I'm ugly as sin but I feel that not everyone can have the Uber specific beauty standards of society and infact being ugly shouldn't be seen as bad but just another descriptor of human looks.  We are fine with ugly art and even music that totally disregards the aesthetic trends of the art form so idk what's wrong with being 'ugly' ? Although it's all perception anyway so maybe it doesn't matter because I think I'm hideous but others don't seem to think so"
"'It's inner Beauty that really counts. Anyway let's talk about plastic surgery.'"

"Natalie is my fellow Libra inspiration all day, every day."
"reqatching it for 5th time. Splendid, love every your video"
"Natalie you keep articulating my innermost demons with every video. I have PCOS and so I've identified to a mild degree with some of the dysphoric struggles of trans women. Do I have a full beard? No. But I still have a goatee of dark hairs that I have to shave regularly because having facial hair as a woman at all is not in the beauty standards and goddamn it I wanna be beautiful. I don't want to look like a man and seeing myself with male-associated traits makes me feel ugly as hell. Furthermore I want to be beautiful without having to shave my face or try to wear outfits that balance my narrow hips and broad, square shoulders or wear makeup to do so. I just wanna be an easy breezy beautiful fat-bottomed pretend vegan instamodel who makes easy cash taking sexy pictures on the beach posing with strange fruit and only needs facetune for zits. But I guess somebody needs to lose the genetic lottery. Thanks, Nietzsche."
"yes all that about style. You're an artist in so many ways, your body and face is one more canvass... even if it can cause more mental illness!"
"I recommend a somatic therapist. I don't explain why things are true anymore, she has me sit in my body. you might become more relaxed around your appearance."
"You are super funny and very smart. 💕"
"I refuse to do FFS because it is absurd, and not in thousand years I will have that much money. No matter how bad I feel sometimes looking at myself in the mirror, I know I will feel better tomorrow. I do not want someone to butcher me on their table just to shave off “few millimeters of bone”. I refuse to do that shit.    I believed that you could see through all that bullshit, and refuse to do all that shit. I was wrong."
"yes sophie, yes."
"I came here looking for a transgender Mother Teresa.  Convert me mommy."
"You ever wonder if your problems are shallow and meaningless and any solution you apply to them are going to fade like dust in the wind when Cthulhu raises from the depths to consume the world in madness?   Bonus question, do you think instagram should make a filter that makes you look like an eldritch horror so we can finally look like we feel on the inside?     No?  Just me?   Well good job on your transition.  And not being unemployed.  And the production values and makeup and stuff.     P.S. I think that was my grandmother's skull but we buried her back in 1992 how did you get it?"
"B U R G E O N I N G"
"K, I've been thinking about it, and I have two remaining thoughts.  1) Style norms are still influenced by unjust power structures.  It isn't as if all styles receive equal admiration or acceptance.  You can still be ridiculed, and you can still be disrespected because your style is associated with race, body-type, all that stuff.  Style norms are easier to change than beauty norms though, and one's own style is easier to change than one's own beauty, so I think you are still right to redirect our self image to style rather than beauty.  2) It's not really easy to change our desires directly from intellectual critique, I see that.  However, it is somewhat possible to make a direct change to the way that we consume media, or to some parts of our lifestyle, and that might change our desires.  We might be less obsessed with unattainable beauty if we consumed less media of some types, or contributed to it differently.  I'm thinking, for example, like getting on Insta less often and posting and commenting on fewer 'beauty' pictures.  All that said, I really appreciate yet another thoughtful episode!  That staring in the mirror trying desperately to convince myself that I'm beautiful... Oof."
"G A Y, but you’re funny as hell"
"You seem like you would give a great TED Talk."
"'Maybe the lesbians are just straight chillin while everyone else has completely lost their minds.' 😂🤣"
"what a perfect time to release this video!!! amongst the self-destruction of the beauty community over this James Charles/tati beef, we’re treated to your thoughtful uh, thoughts on beauty itself. thanks nat💖"
"yyyYYYAYYEYYAYAAAAAAAS to the ASMR. XD"
"I feel. Weird when it comes to this topic.   About lesbians and performing gender. Idk how common my experience broadly is. But my gender performance is mostly to reject the male gaze as hostile as possible. Because I don't like men and I didn't like being seen as a girl either.       To simplify much too greatly I'm basically a genderfluid afab demigirl lesbian with several areas of dysphoria. But they aren't really areas makeup would help with. More height and hips kinda stuff.    Growing up unsure of my gender or orientation  I was very confused. And for quite a while I just kinda just adopted a butch identity which just became more distressing as time went on. And even from a young age I always performed that tomboy/butch stuff to the point where it could be considered toxic masculinity. Must hate pink, must reject all makeup, must hate girly toys, must never like the singular female character present for being 'too feminine to be authentic'. I'd take on physical tasks much too strenuous for me to prove that girls aren't always weak and I'm not really one of them anyway. In that same 'not like the other girls' desperation I'd hang out with the bro-est dudes ever and just assimilate their culture and try to top it. Cat calling, unfounded sexual commentary about pretty much any other girl, pretty much all that junk until I was fully accepted as 'one of the guys'. (Behavior that I only really did around them for social approval)  This however did not stop my non friends from looking at me and seeing a small, curvy, shy, girl with soft, fine, long, hair. Tons of sexualization, harassment, 'chivalrous treatment'. Unwanted advice about 'attracting men better'. I chopped off all my hair asymmetrically, dyed it wild colors. Wore baggy clothes. Did everything to look less sexy and less feminine in public.   But at home I mostly liked my body. Not as in how it feels, but looking. Idealic to me and the base that all aesthetic beauty  was judged by and most fell short.    Is it any wonder I developed a split personality and often dissociated so hard that I couldn't recognize myself from Kristen Stewart if I tried? Still can't sometimes tbh.    Idk, but it is bizarre hating your femininity while admiring it in a depersonalized state and wanting to publicly distance from it because of your own confusion and hatred of a label.   With no obstacles in my way I probably still wouldn't get too much surgery. Because it's like a bizaro version of that 'autogynophilia' trope in reality. The feelings are still mixed but I'd rather know I aesthetically like how I look, than hope a surgery might also make me more comfortable socially and in my own skin. I would get chest reduction because it's actually recommended for my back pain plus the dysphoria aspect. Just too scared and no $$.     To many, not wanting surgery, having a gender similar to assigned one, and feeling dysphoria is mostly socially constructed, makes me clearly fake and not really trans. Just a girl trying to feel special.  That was my number one source of actual invasive thinking dysphoria. That if I could just perform gender a little bit *more* I'll finally be accepted as 'not a girl' or 'androgynous' at the very least. Maybe facial hair and men's pants and t shirts. But lol at getting hrt in Oklahoma when you're as 'confused' as me. But no amount of performing by binary standards would work. Especially since I have even less affinity for masculinity than I do femininity.    And non binary standards barely even exist at all.   Now I'm a nudist that spends my time as a shut in nerd writing novels about lesbian  shape shifting dragons and also 1920s au Germany where socialists beat the nazis before they became very popular, when not creating anarchist propaganda for the internet.   So I'm a bit more comfortable completely dismissing the gendered attacks on me in general than most. Mostly because I don't deal with people IRL hardly at all.  Despite being completely ruled by a desire to fit in most of my life.   Distance from constant feedback I think helped. But too much isolation is often unhealthy. But so is being told to kill yourself over a haircut or being blamed on suicide for existing, or being sexually threatened by men thinking rape makes you straight.  so pick your poison, insanity comes either way.   I can feel most of the sides. Dysphoria. Euphoria. Indifference. Contempt. Escapism. Essentialism. Constructivism. I've felt and rejected them all on numerous occasions.   But I still don't really know how I should feel about gender dysphoria compared to other social or body dysphorias. Literally the same? Different in some way?  Is there gender dysphoria that exists when gender isn't assigned by physical traits  or at all? Is there any material basis for gender as we understand it at all?  Mostly I feel like 'it's all arbitrary and entirely social until it's made pathological by popular demand'. But is that just my own bias saying I'd be fine if I never internalised anything gendered?  It's still confusing to me lol."
"I reaaaally wish I was skilled enough to do your eyeshadow look!"
"16.43: That music from Fantasia. The part with the dinosaurs if I remember correctly. Don't know what the piece is called but I doubt it's listed in the description."
"Omg what an intro! You've outdone yourself!"
"I really wish we had an Indian version of you, India is so backwards when it comes to beautiy women want to be like bollywood ideals and bleach their skin lighter, hate on darker skinned Indians and hate their Indian features as ugly, wanting more Caucasian standard features."
"Who's the woman in the picture at 16:02?"
"This is the first video I've seen from you and I first have to say that this is very high quality. It's really cutting deep. I have a makeup IG and have been trying to put my voice out, but this art block and self-image has made me doubt pursuing being a MUA. And you're right, it's going to take some self-analysis. Thanks for the effort for this video and for sharing."
"'F*ck the revolution, I wanna be pretty rich girl!'  I want this on t-shirt..."
"If only inner beauty was on the surface."
"15:56 damn really went for my jugular there"
"'why is my neck two decades older than the rest of my skin' m E  I feel like my neck is either 50 or still in puberty and it hasn't figured out which yet"
"Nah, you didn't remove your bodyhair because of transphobia, my dear. You removed them because you have a misogynistic vision of women that you try to copy."
"sorry you don't feel pretty but I really like your videos because you offer a perspective that helps reshape my view of the world and inspires confidence to strengthen the bonds to those who need support the most. in a way you make the world more beautiful. but I digress, you do you"
"Kind of a bummer. Plastic surgery changes your brain (the feedback of facial muscles and emotion). I tried to think of examples where I'd burn cash as a cis woman on cosmetics and stuff, and for sure no one wants harassment. Maybe gender performance just creeps me out. I miss when you were a guy sometimes lol, less intimidating and locking in the definition of 'woman' maybe some of us wish didn't even exist. You do you girl, you're beautiful imo because of your thoughts and jokes mostly... beauty shouldn't be a binary thing, as many artists know. Hopefully see more videos on politics and climate change actually, my reaction to this was indeed: 'Aren't people dying from climate change? Contras consuming partly to appeal to heteropatriarchy daddy and mutilating herself oh the god world is ending'. Anyway, still beloved comrade. Aside from some of us wanting more smashing and less consumption you're fine as you are."
"was NOT expecting sophie and honestly....... a serve"
"Wat r the products!!"
"I know it's not your job or responsiblity, and I don't expect you to respond but I must be like tech dumb but how do I contact you. I'm use to using EMail. Do you have an inbox? I have a story and a question and I don't want to put their shit on blast but I really don't know who else to reach out too."
"Natalie, I don't know if it's different for models or Angelina Jolie, but I think most people don't know if they're pretty or not. Your mom has to say so, for one thing. If I 'get' a hot guy, am I equally hot? Maybe he settled or is blind. Who knows? I think this is normal."
"i'm not the only one who thinks she really looks like celine dion right?? beautiful!! <3"
"what a shame"
"I'M UGLY AND I'M PROUD!"
"hey also i know you won't read this Natalie, but if you've been taking opiates for post-surgery pain those can make you depressed (especially if you already have a history of depression). i was on them for a week after getting my wisdom teeth removed and I got very depressed. I'd watch movies with kiss scenes and I'd cry because I thought I'd never be kissed again. so yeah."
"I wish I could change my phone vibration sound to your whining sound"
"Please speak up I can't hear you over that amazing top."
"i think ur videos aren’t as good as they used to be.  I felt they were more real and def had more interesting topics overall.  for a one month production schedule.. it’s been meh in the last two videos."
"I'm a cis asexual dude and for most of my life I really didn't give a shit about my appearance.  Acne?  Meh.  Clothes?  Whatever works.  I only got a hair cut when i absolutely had to.  When I hit 30 it's like a damn switch went off in my brain and now I'm weirdly into how I look.  I've shelled out more money than I probably should updating my wardrobe, I've got a pretty intensive skin care regimen (if I get even a tiny zit I mildly freak out), and I religiously get a hair cut every month to keep it fresh.  I also constantly stress out about my body fat and I work out 4-5 times a week (which isn't that new to me since I was in the military and normally worked out anyway, but it's just harder to keep the weight off as I age, especially since I still drink like I did when I was in the military).  I really don't understand why I'm like this now.  Like I said, I'm ACE, I really don't give a shit about getting laid, but being conventionally attractive is somehow desirable.  Maybe it's because I live in the DC area now and a lot of people around here are insanely shallow?  But I don't really give a shit about those people, so I don't know.  Regardless, no matter what I do it never feels like enough.  Idk, humans are weird.  Anyway, love the video.  Keep on keeping on, Natalie."
"On an unrelated note, Natalie discovering her biological sequin ASMR is the purist thing in the world 🤣"
"I personally don't think that beauty is a bad thing to strive for, depending on one's mindset, and I certainly don't think you should be ashamed for wanting to be beautiful, even if it does fall into the whole 'society sucks' thing. Think of it as a hobby or just a casual past time, another way to improve yourself. There are many things which go into the visual beauty of someone which can have positive effects on their health. For example, about a year ago I was quite fed up with how skinny I was (and my mom telling me how I looked like a twig every other day) so I started working out regularly, and it felt great after a few weeks! It improved my outlook on life, I felt better about myself, etc. I was getting closer to the look I wanted for myself. So you getting surgery to pursue the look you want for yourself shouldn't be something to be ashamed of. I don't quite get the whole fat thing, as I don't think anyone should strive for being overweight, it simply isn't a healthy thing to do, however if that's what someone wants to look like, who am I to say they shouldn't do it. It's their body after all, and I think this train of thought should apply to everyone who strives for their personal standard of beauty.   Moreover, I wouldn't worry too much about getting old, there are a number of technologies pretty close to being just around the corner that will be able to repair cell damage on a body wide scale, leading to effectively aging being reversed. So as long you live until the first wave of life extension technologies, I would say you are set. I also think that on the coming decades there will be ever more artificial bodily modifications available on the market, think synthetic skin or digitized tattoos or stronger limbs. So if you aren't satisfied with your biological appearance in the future, just swap it out, problem solved.   Finally, I really do agree with what you said regarding style. Having a good sense of unique style can easily do as much to enhance the appeal of someone as if they were attractive to you. For example, I once saw a group of people walking around some galleries while I was working as a guard at a museum, and most people who came to the museum were dressed pretty average. Even if they were attractive in my eyes, I got used to this sea of people after a while. However, in this group of people I saw this one time there was a middle aged women, if I had to guess maybe in her 40's, but god damn she was dressed so well that she looked way more interesting than anyone I'd ever seen. Distinct but not shouty, refined but not boring, it was amazing really the difference that it made, and I thought 'man I wasn't expecting to ever see an American composed this well'. Later I over heard her speaking on the phone while I was making my rounds, and of course, she was speaking Italian, ahh what was I thinking after all. Anyways, my point here isn't to try and make fun of Americans (ok maybe a little) but to illustrate how much of a difference having a unique and individual style can make. So pursue beauty, but pursue it in a positive way, it need not have all these negative connotations, make it a personal thing rather than a societal thing and hopefully if enough people do it that way we can eliminate a lot of the societal taboos and biases around this concept, and be all the better for it."
"Oh, I've missed Lady Foppington! I actually really enjoy her lectures, and your choice of words and delivery make me green with jealousy! I dream of wielding my own language with such elegance and poise. Also, yay for Tabby! I've missed her, too."
"you are so insightful"
"This really helped me with some of my own issues with beauty. Thank you for this ❤️"
"aw, <3 u"
"wow, I just subbed!"
"The guys not liking makeup thing is sooo true. My bf told me early on that he loves how I use the 'natural look' and the 'makeup free look' when my face was CAKED for last few dates lmaooo"
"for me personally, I spent a lot of my adolescence worrying about being beautiful. I thought it, along with being fuckable, were the only measures of my value. I eventually figured out that other things make me happier than waxing my snail trail and that I don't feel like the real me when my freckles are covered in foundation. I feel more confident a lot of the time without makeup on, and I think part of that is it makes me feel less restricted to femininity. However, I do tint my eyebrows because I think it ties my face together nicely and I'm blessed to have naturally banging hair that requires little maintenance so it's not like i walk around totally a-gender.  not that I want to compare my experience to yours, more to your characterisation of 'not like other girls' grad students who don't wear makeup."
"Great video Natalie, as always."
"There is great worth in just talking and being. By discussing this very important subject, many hear you and will talk to others. You are in a position to do great things, just by restating your truth."
"I’ve never seen one of your videos before but this is probably the best video I’ve ever seen in the history of Youtube ::subscribe::"
"I feel like sometimes, Contra tends a bit towards gender essentialism, which I disagree with. As a biological female,  I don't feel the irresistible urge to decorate myself with makeup and jewellery. I am not trying to be 'like a man,' whatever that means, nor am I trying to suppress some sort of natural 'femininity' (again, I have a hard time grasping exactly what this would entail). I just don't think there are mental characteristics that inherently distinguish men from women. 18th century men also wore makeup and wore ornate clothing. The so-called 'feminine' and 'masculine' just amount to nothing more than social norms and trends."
"Meanwhile, your eyeshadow is EVERYTHING! And I never knew how much I needed biological sequins."
"Please step on my throat, mommy."
"I might have actually found someone who could appreciate my response to drawn-on eyebrows: 'Do you have supra-orbital ridge disease? [huh?] It's like cancer, but it makes your eyebrows fall off.' By the way, I originally saw this on Digg and had both youtube and digg versions open and there was an overlay of offset audio, but I thought it was how the video was produced and it was freaky as could be."
"I wish you would go back to making videos about society rather than videos about You and how society impacts You. Well, you have the Patreon money now, so of course, the interest in lifting up the less privileged dwindles with every dollar per month."
"What you were trying to achieve you have done so in spades. I am just some random person on the internet so you will have to take my opinion with a grain of salt. As someone who has found you very attractive to begin with , your efforts have yielded amazing results. I encourage you to ignore the jealous people if you can and if you can't like me do so, then count my small praise as a factor of 10 greater if you would be so kind :)"
"Natalie you always have thee best outfits."
"I was just going through old videos and WOW you'e so different now, although I do sometimes miss the old voice"
"28:45 well,  actually......"
"hey i'm a transient non-binnery Dude and i heavily related to this and i'm in love with u after one video so... there's that!"
"Choke me mommy"
"This video dug up my suppressed paranoia of beautiful and being respected and now I’m crying thanks"
"I am so pumped to embrace my hidden dream of being a disabled 'model' or 'infulancer' I will get back into public speaking, keep up on shaving my head so I can show off my stunning scars, and find someone to talk pretty pictures of me.   In the past I've wanted photos of me (like my profile pick of me glass blowing) just to remember fun times in my life, times of quite enjoyment.   I want that still. I also want to outline with scars with glittery gold eyeliner and do a duck face for insta."
"You matter 😀💖"
"Misread 'diseased' as 'deceased'. I had to pause the video while I laughed up a lung.   As always, fantastic video. I love you, your truth, and your humor. Rock on!"
"Hey you said you had full body hair removal. Where did you go? My amazing future husband needs it."
"..but can you make an asmr video"
"That fantasia soundtrack mmmm this is why I'm here."
"I'm a cis woman who's on a career track into academia, and I love makeup.  I watch tutorials all the time and buy makeup even through I don't wear it often. It's really just a lack of time for me, because I can't get up early enough to go through the whole process"
"Yeah, pause the video at a 18:20 and just look. How that is objectively a 9/10 women look.   Of course if you dismiss all compliment as flattery, reject all outside confirmation as evil manipulative lies that only leave your own estimation of your beauty situation (which I' m going to guess, is your harshest critic).     It's like you set out to look like a women, accomplished that without noticing yourself, kept going and at some point reach and passed by 'beautiful women'  look and you still want more !   Are you trying to women beauty olympics ? I feel like you' re going to create that olympic category because you won' t be satisfied until you have 5 international judges scoring you for medals !   At some point you' re going to reach some kind of singularity of womanness, the most womany that anyone can possibly be. A kind of women pole, a place from where every direction is male."
"attitude produces behaviour; successful behaviour reinforces behaviour. Change your attitude (with awareness? critique?), and you'll behave differently, which will further change your attitude. Simple, right? ;)"
"you've got a late-90s Celine Dion vibe going there."
"this is all great and all but aS a cIs WomAn with a busted up nose it pains me to see that you got rid of yours. idk I kinda hate plastic surgery cause it reminds me my facial features aren't wanted. not your problem but just. idk."
"That intro just blew my mind. Thanks for introducing me to Sophie, you already made me a fan of Zoe Blade."
"Ok. Probably going to get crucified for this.  I'm cis het male, LGBTQ comfortable (I march and write letters to congresspeople and shit) and have friends in both L-Q and Trans communities.  I have never felt attracted to any of them. Then you came along, and I've been harboring this secret crush on you since about a month after I found your channel. ( Like a year now).  It's a thing that is officially on my 'to deal with' list now, and I'm not at all sure how I feel about it.  But I do think you are beautiful and super attractive. (Hot)Smart+funny=Spanish Fly.  Sincerely,  Faithful internet creeper."
"About the point of women still wearing make up even when males are not present. I don't think that refutes daddy's idea that it stems from a biological place. If it is an evolutionary practice it would be programed into the genome, so it would be an inherent part of what feminine is, even if there aren't males to apreciate it."
"This really hit home. Not because I'm trans or can identify with that, but because I just had gastric bypass surgery and while the decision to do surgery was mainly for health there will always be the element of just wanting to be thin. As a person who thinks fat bodies are beautiful it feels hypocritical."
"I’ve struggled with a lot of these issues as a cis gendered woman and equally obsessed with beauty - with a post graduate degree a lot of times I felt I wasn’t being taken seriously the more “feminine” I presented myself, but I’ve strongly fought that love of beauty and intelligence can exist in the same space."
"In a way I feel bad. Cause I know that both my transition goal and my idea of beauty, is pretty damn close to society's assumption of what non-passing trans women look like. I'm not saying it can't feel like absolute horse shit to look like a hairy, deep-voiced man in a dress if that's not the kind of look you're going for, and I hate society's shitty treatment of non-passing trans women as much as anyone, but I still feel bad about having made it into an aesthetic and I'm not sure what I have to say in my defense. It's... just one of those nonbinary things...?   Also it's not really all in my control that 99% of random people I run into always assume that I'm a trans woman and ask me if I got my dick cut off yet. But they tend to look quite baffled when I respond that I've never even had a dick. Yes, I'm afab, transitioned with testosterone and loving those male traits I got, and I've got a thing for hyper-feminine alternative fashion. Put all those things together and I do look like a bad stereotype that'll haunt you in your dreams at night.  The false assumption that I'm a trans woman is so far away from my reality that it almost comes full circle. Cause this hairy, deep-voiced, 'non-passing' mess with boobs in a dress that I am, is my actual transition goal - not my start. But there's nothing I can pass as, being nonbinary in this way. So what then, if the societal beauty standards don't apply to me, and because what allievates my dysphoria is making me destined to live the rest of my life being falsely assumed to be the very kind of person (gender wise) that society looks down upon the most? Well, then I get to deal with the social repercussions that are not even targetting me.   But I'm already beautiful. I see it in the mirror almost every time I look into it, but most importantly I can feel it. I mean I don't even mind my flaws. I display them carefreely. So I don't need beauty in the way society tells me... just hand me a damn flame thrower! (Also I'm a lesbian, so you're quite on point about that too.) So I won't be getting any plastic surgery then, huh? Oh, who am I kidding! I'm already lined up for a boobjob!"
"The large pores part killed me i really look in the mirror like yo what's up with these circles on my nose... googles how to reduce large pores that only you are noticing"
"You want beauty because you want power over your peers and strangers. Social power, sexual power, you name it. Not that complicated, yet you omit that particular reason, which is really the root reason."
"@Contra Points Or you could just, you know, look for some actual value in your life.   The fact that constant deconstruction and dialectic are going to keep that solution you apparently crave so much just out of reach must at some level be apparent even to you.   It is all built on a foundation of nihilism, and that is something that is going to eat anyone from the inside. Been there, done that.   Start by looking at some things that are actual positive values you have. No, ending oppression doesn't coun't, as that is the same old process cannibalizing itself which is keeping you in your loop.   Take something like climate change, or environmentalism in general. Instead of viewing it as the next thing to feel guilty for, the ultimate oppression dynamic, how about you try looking at it this way: There are valuable things which are in different ways a foundation or necessary condition for our civilization. These are worth being preserved and so is said civilization.   I hope you read this because after this video, I actually feel for you. Good luck I guess."
"I love u💖💖"
"Lmfao 'Phones live in a society.' I think I'm gonna like it here."
"It's so crazy because I feel like I'm watching a different person..."
"tatianna, petrovna, westbrookova  but the gays, just call me   TATI"
"Hey Contrapoints, if you're attractive to the people who you want to have sex with, isn't that a good measure of you being attractive? There are some people who are just beautiful outright, and most of us are not them, but ultimately if we are able to have sex with people we are attracted to I feel like you can safely, and by definition, consider yourself attractive."
"I'm gaying out on you here!"
"That intro was fucking sick 10/10"
"This was your saddest video yet :("
"I don't think you're ugly, you're pretty cute actually. The only issue I see there is the angle of the inner ends of your brows. The way you've drawn it is a little strange. But it just might be me really, I have a very specific taste in brows."
"since watching contrapoints i've started painting my nails. also yes your definetly attractive, also yes that lil pikachu is adorable."
"how do you do such good production value?"
"non binary here lol"
"As a trans guy, I get what you mean, but opposite..."

"Just found your channel! You make amazing content , the quality of your videos are of the charts! I would love to know your take on drag. I hear the argument  that it’s making a mockery  of femininity. Which is true in a way. Drag is definitely  a caricature of a persona but I feel like it allows marginalized groups a space to explore femininity/queer identity. I think there’s a lot of interesting history there to unpack and different communities have divisive opinions on it. I’d love to hear your take!"
"I am probably going to say something that feels insulting to a trans, well I'm not sure, really sorry As a mostly straight male, you do look fine on the beginning of the putting on makup part. like the last little bit of (not manliness anymore) boyness in you is kind of cute. what I'm trying to say is that i prefer that look to the overly female tryhard one.   The part where you pointed out that trans mostly try to attain beauty standard femalehood and not actually real aspect of the feminine body really made me think. The fact that you have no hair on your body is kind of weird and reflect a pretty weird idea of what a female look like.   I sure like always with you did learn about the trans mind and if my comment hurted you in any way know that it just comes from an ignorant place   love xoxoxoxo"
"For what its  worth all these videos are really helping me through a tough time. These funny and incredibly interesting videos are a gem that shouldn't be this low on the view count . Thank you Nat."
"Completely not the point, but I really like skincare so here goes: -don't exfoliate your face every day, it's pretty harsh on your skin. When you exfoliate do it on your neck too, like you should with the rest of the products to prevent it from aging different from your face. -there are 2 main types of toner, the western one is astringent (drying your skin out like crazy, often used for acne or last swipes of makeup remover, I do not recommend it but everyone can form their own opinion) and the Asian one, which is meant to return the skin to its natural ph level after cleansing, and hydrate. Some of them focus on acne as well, but it will say it by itself. Sunscreen is supposed to protect you from burning, skin cancer and according to many dermatologists also premature aging (like wrinkles), - that was most likely a joke, but putting it out there anyways since someone I know is dying as a result of cancer and thisone is simpler to prevent-.  Edit: also, sunscreen can be difficult to remove, clogging pores and causing pimples, oil cleansers seem to do a better job of removing it than foam because like dissolves like."

"I once had a friendly debate with a prof about who gets taken less seriously / who do people assume are not smart, funny people or beautiful people. Either way, people on the street must assume you're flighty and dumb. Your viewers know better, of course.   I felt a little called out when you started describing the women of academe who don't wear makeup, and would only apply fake lashes for Halloween, but of course, you're totally right. Thanks for another excellent video.     BTW, the Organization for the Study of Communication, Language and Gender's (http://osclg.org/) conference deadline is this Saturday, and you only need an abstract to submit.

"What you said about style resonates very much with my life currently. I dream of having FFS one day, but today many other factors unfortunately restrict my expression. At least I developed a unique style which contrasts with my immediate environment. Memento mori, remember death. More than having a female skull during my decay, I want to be cremated ASAP and be remembered solely for the abstract beauty of the music I compose, not for what my limited physical existence has made me be."

"i'm a lesbian and to be real the main focus of my life has been being a beautiful femme, when i was younger it came from self loathing but as i grew up it became less about what i wasn't and more about what i wanted to be i can tell you that you were beautiful before but the reality is that until you feel it internally, you just wont feel it. good shit getting whatever surgery you want in order to pursue the way you want to present yourself"
"Welcome to womanhood in the western world Natalie."
"point is so contra doesn't feel too bad, well pledge more on patreon everyone."
"I always thought you were beautiful. Always"
"I think you've captured a fundamental part of femininity, to be honest. Society tells ALL of us that we're not enough, and even if we deconstruct those societal pressures, they don't go away. I feel slightly guilty when I put on makeup, but I also lowkey glee if I feel more beautiful for it."
"Not that anyone cares, but here’s my experience as a 6”1 cis woman. When I was growing up, I was extremely aware of how much taller I was than everyone else. I felt like I simply couldn’t be feminine at my height, thanks to the beauty/clothing industry mostly catering towards petite girls. I could never find clothes that fit me properly unless I shopped in the men’s section. Due to not being able to find feminine clothes that fit me properly, I was pushed to present more masculine, which just made me feel ugly and frumpy (it probably didn’t help that I also had a huge Not Like Other Girls Complex™️ as a teen).   Once I got to high school, I had the realization that I can still be feminine despite towering over almost everyone. I finally found a pair of jeans that fit and just accepted the fact that every shirt that I wear is going to look like a crop top. I started wearing makeup and getting comfortable with showing off more of my body."
"Gymnopedie No. 1 deliberate reference to My Dinner With André much?"
"The point about style as apposed to beauty is an excellent one."
"Thank you"
"Also, I'd like to add that the thing is, some women in academia are actually not that interested in being beautiful, they never grew up thinking they could and it isn't really important to them either because they have found other things in life that are way more important. Looks have always gone together with being attractive to people and fit in society and some might not care about that, sometimes honestly don't care. A lot of people in the sciences and academia are on the autism spectrum and for them, their field often is a lot more important than people around them, it's not about being 'not like other girls' ."

"You are beautiful, stylish, creative, smart and amazing. Also, as someone with psoriasis I  can tell you, the number of moisturizing products you use is not that bad.  I usually use a combination of 7 (not counting eye moisturizer and sheet masks) including; serums,  essences, a toner (to balance skin ph levels), an ampoule and a moisturizer. I 💖 your work. You make me aware of things I wasn't before. You make me think. Also, just YES to dancing Detective Pikachu 😄"
"DON'T SKIP SUN SCREEN"
"good vid. but aS A PaTrHiArCaL gAmEr i don't honestly agree with the 'women don't wear makeup to be more cockable': my experience as a person who is starting to care more for its own appearence tells me that what happens is OBLIVION OF THE PURPOSE. You start doing it to get laid/to be more accepted and considered, which is simply a more gentle way to say that you do it to get laid. But any mind cannot contain both the premise 'i do it to please others' and 'i am, maybe, worthy of something, in my good days, probably'. If you follow the path, the second premise will kick the first out beacuse it will just be more consistent with reality and reinforced by it. So you will have to look for another explaination for why you keep dressing good and wearing makeup.  This different explaination very often cannot be achieved, so it becomes a matter of obligation: 'i wear make up because i must!' 'WHAT? going out without makeup?!'.   Another reason for why it becomes an obligation are the social pressures of course. But the way in which the social norms get interiorized by you is always beacuse you want 'to fit in', or the SoCiEtY would have no power on you.   Another reason is just that it becomes an habit. Habit reinforces all the cycle.   This is how, for example, i began to stop wearing dirty old sweaters when i'm at home but now i'm wearing the nice sweaters of last year's collection. I get laid alone at home? sometimes... but i don't need others for that so why am i dressing better than before?   I interiorized the norm. I forgot the puropose. But the purpose was fucking there at the start, it's the core."
"I feel you, in so many ways! I'm also a 5ft2 happy baby bouncy biogirl inside. They are cute and sexy and can get away with all sorts of stuff, because it's adorable if they do that. In real life I'm a 5ft9 bony woman with lumpy wide hips and a sharp nose with a disorder that makes me clumsy and therefore makes me as elegant as an nauseous elephant in your stiff grandmothers porcelain cabinet. Hurray! I'm also unhappy with being a woman, because periods suck, and not being taken serious sucks even harder. It's sometimes so bad, it makes me doubt if I'm not maybe trans or genderfluid or something, but I'm not. I'm just unhappy with society. Can we have this revolution already?"
"Brazil needs you too! You are goddess."
"Hello Contrapoints, I wonder if you could make a video about religion and it's place within socialism. I am a socialist myself and I agree with Marx's statement that religion is 'An opium for the people' and that it's just another system used to oppress people. But then there are other socialists that pro religious freedom and I simply cannot see how you can fit religion into socialism?"

"I read this quote that really helped me:  “Next time you get dressed, as you apply cosmetics, jewelry or other ornaments, consider that you are dressing your altar - an altar that serves to communicate with other beings and concentrates your power and energy.”    ...and then this article by Jess Zimmerman in Catapult that has CHANGED me (will link, but here is a key excerpt)     'Medusa lost her beauty—or rather, it was taken from her. Beauty is always something you can lose. Women’s beauty is seen as something separate from us, something we owe but never own: We are its stewards, not its beneficiaries. We tend it like a garden where we do not live.   Oh, but ugliness—ugliness is always yours. Almost everyone has some innate kernel of grotesquerie; even fashion models (I’ve heard) tend to look a bit strange and froggish in person, having been gifted with naturally level faces that pool light luminously instead of breaking it into shards. And everyone has the ability to mine their ugliness, to emphasize and magnify it, to distort even those parts of themselves that fall within acceptable bounds.   Where beauty is narrow and constrained, ugliness is an entire galaxy, a myriad of sparkling paths that lurch crazily away from the ideal. There are so few ways to look perfect, but there are thousands of ways to look monstrous, surprising, upsetting, outlandish, or odd. Thousands of stories to tell in dozens of languages: the languages of strong features or weak chins, the languages of garish makeup and weird haircuts and startling clothes, fat and bony and hairy languages, the languages of any kind of beauty that’s not white. Nose languages, eyebrow languages, piercing and tattoo languages, languages of blemish and birthmark and scar. When you give up trying to declare yourself acceptable, there are so many new things to say.   You’re not supposed to do this, of course. You’re supposed to be ashamed of your ugliness. Why? Because it’s objectively shameful? Or because it reduces your value as a decoration, a prize, an advertisement—because it benefits nobody but yourself?   Medusa lost her beauty, but she never lost her ugliness. It only grew and grew, becoming something greater than herself but still part of her legend. Becoming, in a way, beautiful—but an undomesticated, frightening beauty, the beauty of Pegasus.    The freedom of ugliness includes the freedom to find beauty in the static and blur. If you stopped laboring over beauty for someone else to judge and find wanting, how much more energy would you have to cultivate your ugliness? To build something you can keep?'   https://catapult.co/stories/role-monsters-gorgons-medusa-women-beauty-ugliness"

"With apologies, part of cis privilege, just like the women who don't care much about shaving their legs, some of us, not to be contrarian, just don't give that much of a fuck about makeup. Some of us also live in climates where that shit just melts off your face in the first 10 minutes after leaving your house anyway, so I'll throw on some eyeliner, maybe eyeshadow if I have to (happened more often when I was younger), lol, but otherwise I leave it as is and just enjoy other aspects of life and apparently, lots of free time =P. Nothing against women, men, and everyone in between and none of the above who enjoys makeup though! I like seeing the looks people come up with =)"
"Sorry Natalie, but if Tabby is going to make an appearance (even if only for a brief moment) it needs to be full Tabby, be-toothed Tabby, be-wigged Tabby.....not Tabby-lite! Anyway, glad the surgery went well, you're awesome."
"i love all of your videos but this one resounded with me a LOT, i'm a woman-aligned nb person who's been wearing makeup since i was 13, and i've always told ppl it's because it's fun and i like it and i'm Expressing Myself but if i'm being honest with myself it's because i hate my appearance so much. i'm always told that i don't need to, but like....i DO, and the mere idea of people seeing me without makeup is really scary. it's so hard to know why we feel the need to alter our appearance thru stuff like makeup and know it's a manipulative tactic, but desperately wanting to be beautiful anyway. i don't know if i'll ever truly be happy with my appearance and that....causes a lot of despair, to be frank. thank you for talking about this, you really are beautiful inside and out, natalie!! <3"

"I'm gonna be honest. I think you're pretty. I've always liked your nose (although I always have thought prominent noses on women are pretty). I also dont exactly know what you mean about collar bones but I have prominent collar bones and I'm cis so I dont know what that says"
"I found this so wonderful and I don't want that to be undermined by the following comment.    I only disagree with one part: the sly dig you made at women who don't wear makeup before delving into women's relationship with makeup to express their individuality and femininity.   If wearing makeup is an expression of individuality, and your statement about style at the end holds up, why is not wearing makeup perceived as a 'not like other girls' flex as opposed to an alternate expression of individuality? Because wearing makeup is the societal norm? Why give $$$ to a beauty industry created to make me feel like I can't be beautiful without their $45 foundations and fake lashes and eyeshadow palettes and what-have-yous? Not to belittle people who spend money on things that make them happy, but if it doesn't make me happy why is it automatically assumed that I have a superiority complex about it?"
"Congratulations! You look great, as usual~   I'm making this comment near the beginning of the video so sorry if I make a mistake"

"I’m waiting for 40 when I’ll be irrelevant. I’m sick of trying to be beautiful. It’s expensive and annoying and you can get by pretty well if you’re funny. That’s cheaper. My bestie wants to get ffs and I’m so sad because she’s beautiful but I also understand."
"Natalie ContraPoints Wynn is braver than any marine"
"okay but WHERE DID YOU GET THAT DRESS/SHIRT/WHATEVER???"
"Too much solipsism imo lately. I love contrapoints, but i feel like i can no longer relate to anything she’s talking about since 1) I’m not trans 2) I don’t have the money to even consider anything like rhinoplasty or laser hair removal and 3) I don’t have gender dysphoria, so this feels like a really long self-justification to wanting to be pretty with great editing"
"I just want a contrapoints skincare routine to be the full 45 min video lol"
"Loved it, especially the end. I like how you dismiss some of that cognitive dissonance at the end, because I've been in the same boat. We can critique things and even wage revolution against patriarchy. But recognizing that beauty is a function of patriarchy doesn't mean beauty standards just go away, and that's okay. I don't like to call it a coping mechanism because of the ideas it evokes, but it's essentially the same idea: making ourselves beautiful, whether we view it as such or not, is a way to cope with the stress of patriarchal standards--some people will reject beauty standards; others will conform. That question is about psychological disposition more than it is about wokeness, though, and it's an important distinction to make for the moralists on the left who want to whine about us being bourgeois or whatever the hell we're doing."
"Despite women naturally growing body hair it isn't very accepted or ever shown as something beautiful or normal in the mainstream. I hate my body hair so fucking much. I'm extremely pale with dark thick Italian hair. I'm hairier than my boyfriend. It's a constant struggle of trying to accept that it's okay that my body looks the way it does and its natural but at the same time the thought of wearing a crop top and having my snail trail on display for the world to see makes me wanna die. When your a woman trans or cis the way media portrays us makes it understandable that so many girls feel like women shouldn't be hairy. I honestly hope I and other girls are able to eventually accept our body hair so we can normalize it in the future."
"❤️ here’s to the endless struggle with unobtainable beauty standards 🥂 but being Gigi gorgeous won’t fix anything, you just have to make being you the most beautiful thing you can be ❤️"

"I really needed this video. I was struggling today with feeling ugly and old(something I actually always deal with). Just seeing a few post on insta or watching a music video makes me feel like a swamp creature. Thank you for sharing your own struggles with beauty.

And in your post ffs picture you reminded me of Shaleen (sp?) Woodley. Like, you’re your own kind of beauty and all of course but like. I think you’re more than your looks by far, but they’re pretty good looks. I am primarily here for your humor and insights, though. Regardless of what you look like. Which, again, is fine."
"I think it’s a very womanly thing to constantly judge and doubt their own appearance, and constantly criticize your own looks to an extreme to which you’d never hold another person. It’s a thing pretty much all women experience, if that’s any kind of consolation?"
"I never knew i wanted a contrapoints makeup tutorial until now."
"I’ve always been of the opinion you’re attractive and interesting and hilarious, and I also like the post surgery face. I am always worried about someone’s noticeable characteristics being changed and not really seeing “them” anymore, and it’s why I have been reluctant to consider my own plastic surgery. Plus wHAT IF IT GOES WRONG AND I DONT LIKE IT AHH. But anyway. I think it’s brave to change your appearance at will and really sculpt and paint your body as you see fit. I admire the transformation of makeup and body mods and tattoos, and I am beginning to admire plastic surgery. You don’t look like “everyone in LA whose surgeon used the same face template” , you look like yourself but different. And if you’re happier here with these changes, I’m happy right along with you. I’m envious of your skin in that second picture fr tho."
"You are lucky that you were able to afford such surgeries. I was born cis female but have PCOS and have an androgony problem and it caused me to develop male “features” and am confused as “transgender” or “male” ALLL the time. I have a superbony orbital rim and large lower jaw and waaaay lots of body hair. I wish I could afford the surgeries to feminise my face and vocal chords!!!!  Edit: also, you remind me of young Cher! And your brow bone shave was 👌👍  Edit: Edit: your skincare regime is almost exactly the same as mine! Shout out to the Mario Badescu mist!"
"*The following has been repeatedly edited to remove exaggeration, per your request.* I think you're a very smart person. I also think you are stunningly beautiful. Your videos are always thoroughly enjoyable, and remarkably educational. You are a heroine to a lot of people, including me. To reiterate, you are my heroine. By the way, you're also beautiful. I hang on your every word and consider you an expert on your subject matter. I like your style very much. When it comes to cultivating intelligence and kindness and all that other stuff, I think you're set. I sincerely hope that you can beat back your psychological gremlins for long enough to enjoy a respite where you can appreciate your own beauty as we do. Did I mention that I think you're beautiful? Thank you for everything you do.   Sincerely, an avid admirer and fellow Philosophy dropout."

"I used to work in IT and that pressure to be masculine is unreal. In fact, I can remember getting 'worse' as far as vanity goes in that industry. I love putting on makeup. It's relaxing for me. I was always the only woman around in the places I worked. Maybe it was me affirming that it was ok to be a woman. Men would snide comments about my full face of makeup, but if I didn't wear it, they'd comment on that too. There's no winning that war.  As  for why I do it, it has nothing to do with men. It's odd, I'm more excited when women comment on my looks than men."

"There are a lot of trans people that look just like not super attractive women. They, to me, often pass as women who just are just average, but they still get ffs to look like pretty women. A lot of them have boobs from hormones that are the size many cis girls naturally have. But they still get implants. That’s okay! It’s okay to want to look better!!!! Idk why a lot feel like they have to make it not vain! I’m cis, and I do a lot to be pretty! That’s normal!"
"Serious question: If I go up to a transwomen in public (which I've obviously clocked or the question wouldn't apply) and give her a general non-creepy compliment like 'I love your hair.' or 'That color looks great on you.', am I going to make her smile at a compliment or just make her anxious that she was clocked? I'm a middle aged woman in a small Southern town, so I know life is tough if you are trans. I'd make that easier if I could. Generally I try to spit it out whenever I think something nice about a stranger, because we all like a genuine compliment. So it's a compliment I would say to any woman. In the video, the 'you can be hot even if you are clockable' was heartbreaking to you. It got me wondering if my good intentions are backfiring too. Should I just go on buying my groceries and mind my own business?"
"I would imagine that telling a transwoman 'Why are you so worried? You're already pretty.' is the equivalent of telling a person with depression 'Why are you so sad? You don't have it that bad.'"
"as a professional lesbian, i can indeed confirm that i am just chillin' and care about none of this :D  great video though"
"It's so weird that we kinda take beauty as a zero-sum game, either you're hot or you're not. Beauty (IMO) is kinda like an anthropomorphized neg. Like, holy shit, ContraPoints is so pretty, but also it's way more than just her jowls that are swollen. Like, every day in the mirror I'm like, god my eyes are fucking dazzling hashtagwokeuplikethis but my chin--MY CHIN, OH THE DIMPLY ACNE-RIDDLED FLAPPY HORROR. Should we make generalising statements about the hotness of our faces for a big hit of either dopamine or depression or should we pick out things individually so that we can come out from behind the bathroom mirror saying 'listen. i'm a solid five. that's good.'"

"I’m going to disagree with Natalie here (ooh? Wha?) by stating not a grad student, but as a bachelor’s degree working person who presents as female (Non-binary) that I don’t wear makeup. And it’s NOT a flex about how I’m better than people who wear makeup - it’s because it takes so damn long for me to get ready in the morning with makeup. For some people a routine that may add 15 minutes to their day actually takes an hour for me and I am not sacrificing my sleep for that. I’m not a morning person either, so the only thing I can manage to do is roll out of bed, rummage for clean clothes & run out the door. I don’t NOT wear makeup because I’m making a statement, I just can’t care enough. This is the shit that 2nd Wave feminists were fighting for, the right to wear or not wear makeup or shave their armpits & legs and pubes, and that not being a deliberate statement about their femininity. I love the rest of Natalie’s video, I’m not a TERF by any means (I am Non-binary, so it would explode TERF’s brains)."

"The problem with beauty standards, is that I really don't believe they are entirely socially imposed. For instance, the very fact that we as humans even find other humans 'attractive', that we have the desire to put our bits on their bits, is very much rooted in our biology. I mean, what are humans but blobs of organic macromolecules undergoing thousands of simultaneous chemical reactions? The very fact that we find our fellow globs of organic matter appealing comes down to an innate evolutionary drive to pass on our genetic material. Now, even though it may sound like it, I'm no social Darwinist or biological absolutist and I fully recognize that human beings are unique and unparalleled in our capacity for thought, reason and empathy compared with the rest of living beings on this planet; which leads to an enormous degree of complexity that the aformentioned schools of thought often fail to address. However, I still believe biology is an undeniably important factor when discussing beauty standards, and something that is often ignored when the topic is debated in more leftist circles."

For example the whole top and bottom, as a bi women I’ve legit had other bi women tell me to dress more masculine and be more like a “top” which is ridiculous. I’m not sure if this is because of the heterosexual persons who say “ah whose the lady in the relationship” but it’s an important topic bc I’ve legit had to question my own gender over it which is bullshit"

"Where did you buy your beautiful dress? Want the saaaaame"
"I honestly think that beauty should not be thought about in dichotomy but in probabilities. How probable that an individual you find attractive finds you attractive, and to what degree.   There are certain things that are very probable to make you attractive to the masses. For instance, being really healthy or humorous. There are also things that make you very attractive to niche groups, while very unattractive to those outside such a group, such as people who wear lots of pink and frills vs those who wear lots of black and leather. Again, its a likelyhood, not a dichotomy. We also have to factor in what you want to use your attractiveness for. Is it for popularity? Getting laid? Finding a life partner? Getting a certain job? Becoming a pro athlete? The only truly scientific way of measuring your attractiveness would be to compare everything about yourself that could be considered attractive to the ideals of everyone you are ideally attracted to. And of course, each trait has a different level of importance to each other. Some people may care more about how well you cook than if your thighs are thicc, for instance, while others would instantly drop you off their radar if your thighs are small.   Beauty is complicated, and unless you set achievable goals for the beauty you want to emulate you'll never get there. I think that so many people find themselves ugly is they cannot quantify it in any way, and indeed, it is almost impossible to do so."

"I'm 63. I didn't start wearing makeup until I was over 60 and got tired of the signs of aging on my face, especially the constant dark circles. Contra, dearest, I didn't acknowledge that I was a beautiful young woman until about five years ago when I saw an old photo from when I was 20. So give it around 30 years, and you'll see how hot you are right now. There something positive about aging for you. xxx"
"as a straight male i gotta say you look way more feminine and atractive to me than before (just take it, i dont consider myself a 'fan'; didnt expect so 'little' change to make so much difference, guess its the reading faces thing we humans do so much) i like the natural makeup best, the thing is wearing makeup is the norm so wearing no makeup maybe looks diseased in contrast to 'the norm' (compared to the person wearing no makeup after doing so and others still wearing it) maybe if a women never wears it it won't be noticed so much, but idk.  my god instagram with ppl is disgusting, i only use it for comics, art and photography as a lurker ... not that im ugly (consider myself average)  thank god im male and am not expected to do all that scincare. i think the fun in beauty is an invention of ads, its a competition with everybody you see if you want to and everyone wants to to some degree, bcs everyone wants to accepted/liked/loved and being beautiful helps     in the end your brain is the best part about you bcs you do these videos, good stuff"

"Sorry but I really don't understand the whole point behind changing your gender . Not because 'sex is biological' or anything but why should any mature full grown human give a flying fuck what their own gender is ? It's the less  obvious version of 'barbies are for girl , cars are for boys' . As in you feel obligated to meet certain requirements to push away the shame from having certain desires ? I don't know why you got surgery but if someone got surgery for example to be able to date men that would be stupid ! The simpler solution is to be a man who is into men !"

"Natalie, there are thousands of people who offer you their affection, respect, and empathy.  One can only envy you for this.  Nevertheless, I am… disappointed that you care so much about your looks.  I myself only care about my appearance when I look in the mirror (Horrors!), so I look in the mirror as rarely as possible.  You, since you fuss and bother about make-up, must spend a whole lot of time looking in the mirror.  Unwise.  (I myself don’t wear make-up.  Never have.  Women will never achieve equality until they, like most men, are comfortable and content with their own faces.)       I have been searching without success for a quote from William James, but it goes something like this:  “Happy is the day when one ceases to care about getting fat and getting older.”  You will get there someday, darling.  I promise.  (If somebody can give me the actual William James quote, I would be very grateful.)"
"Looking good."
"I started viewing the pursuit of beauty and being stylish as being extremely wasteful. It consumes a lot of time. At  one point it I would spend 30 minutes every morning try to cover up my acne and to fix my hair. Then with the actual 'stuff' like overstuffed closets with items that'll never get their full use I see a waste of resources - basically it bothers me just like watching people use plastic spoons once and then toss them aside.  I understand that it brings some people joy, but I wish that it would be viewed in the same way as other self-indulgent things are.                                    Plainness should be valued, like a form of beauty almost, rather than looked down on as someone not caring because often times it represents a strong commitment to other things and not laziness."

"Beauty might be in the eye of the beholder, but your genius is demonstrable. Thank you."
"This is a really fascinating topic because I’ve always felt really disconnected from these conversations. Not because of a holier-than-thou I’m above that mentality, although it might come across that way, but because it’s unattainable. I’m not even in the running.   Most girls won’t look like the girls in the magazines because of photoshop, genetics, diet, money, etc. but there is at least the illusion that one day you could be. I won’t ever look like the girls in the magazine because of a fundemental difference in melanin. I’m not white. What is considered beautiful—white, blonde, thin—is something I will never be. And that’s fucked me up in innumerable ways because beauty equals love and attention and if not personhood at least acknowledgement from men.   I wouldn’t say it’s freed me, it’s just made me kind of despairing and numb in a way I should interrogate far more instead of blindly accepting. I don’t know. I’ve just always felt like beauty was useless and dissapointing because I never saw or, couldn’t even fathom someone like me one day reaping it’s “rewards.” It’s a shade of the beauty conversation—the forever undesirables because of race, disablity, size, etc.—that I don’t see often. Those who will never be allowed through the gates of beauty."

"Blah blah blah, so you're not the prettiest girl in the room, get used to it.   Natalie, did you know that in feudal russia, a woman was valued not for her looks but for the broadness of her back?

"You're very pretty natalie!"
"Omg I can’t believe you are trans it is literally impossible to tell."
"Because women in academics don't put fake nails or fake lashes means they're trying to be more masculine? That's a weird thing to say. I dress femininly, with lots of colors and earings, necklaces, pretty patterns. Yeah I don't wear makeup but how does that make me masculine? How does not putting artificial things on your face makes you masculine? Women in university maybe have been more brought to think about how absurd the concept of performative feminity is, more than trying to appear masculine"

"Social constructs don't change because we want them to, they change because of an underlying change in understanding/meaning in society. It used to be that being tan was super desirable. That changed with the skin cancer awareness & sunscreen revolution. In poor societies, it's difficult to be fat, so that's seen as a sign of wealth and beauty. In our society, overweight is generally a sign of poverty, and fitness a luxury of yoga moms & tennis club dads.   Social construct, sure, but not arising from nothing. Dark eyelashes, red lips, rosy cheeks, clear skin, athletic body... these are all signs of YOUTH. And we are a youth-driven culture more than anything else.    Good luck changing that."

I just want to throw supportive noises at you. You have opened some doors for me and shown me points of view I hadn't seen much before.   I treasure that.   Thank you very much"
"mmmmh that fear and loathing reference."
"Because you kept mentioning how you were trans, it kept nagging at me in my brain like a little note yelling 'SHE WAS A MAN ONCE' over and over, and I kept noticing the little things about you that may give away your past. But while watching the video I kinda zoned out, and suddenly you just seemed seamlessly feminine. Just a woman, no different than any other. It was weird."

"I went on an intense diet that lost me 40 pounds in 3 months. I stopped when I realized I looked different but felt exactly the same, and hated how I looked just the same. When I ended up gaining almost all of it back I felt better than before. The diet had only confirmed my suspicion that my body was okay, it was my perspective that needed changing."
"There are SO MANY GOOD QUOTES FROM THIS VIDEO. I CANT HELP BUT ALL CAPS. SERIOUSLY I LOVE IT."
"That conclusion is incredibly thoughtful and watching this actually makes me feel more woke.  In all seriousness, this is actually such fantastic video, and I second the notion of emphasising style over beauty as the measurement people are held at."

"Okay but I would still straight up lick soy milk off those collarbones, so it’s not all flattery, some of it is abject lust."
"You look just as beautiful as you did before but I’m so happy you took a step to feel more comfortable in your own skin. Thank the gods surgery went well and you still have that big, beautiful brain because that’s the best part about you!"
"You've lost it. Your videos are becoming more and more focused on justifying your own attempts to be 'female' and less attached to reality. You've become just another transcommie goon. Worst video in a while."

"As a bio cis female who has body dsymorphic disorder, i find myself actually relating a lot to contrapoints' feelings on cosmetic surgery being both gender reaffirming, but also aesthetic. I think about getting surgery often, but it's not because I'm reassigning, its because even with my natural woman's body it still doesn't feel feminine enough. I follow a few trans women on YouTube and they're all gorgeous, but i can't help having this painful tang in the back of my mind that 'of course if you could design a feminine aesthetic, it'd be gorgeous'. The goal cant just be to look like an average woman...it's to look like an attractive woman. In that way, gender dysphoria and body dsymorphia are similar because whether youre biologically female or not, you still don't feel female enough."

"You make the happy chemical happen"
"I think you looked more femme before the surgery you let society coax you into... but maybe that's what happens when you 'identify' as 'rans rather than as a woman, and feeling comfortable as a woman regardless of how you look, because a woman doesn't look like the surgery idealised by those around the world regardless of gender. a woman looks like who she says she is."
"Very good video overall.... except you're right, you did make my lil enby ass cringe with the gross generalizations at times. Especially (semi-related) with the speculations into why women would choose not to wear make-up. Insinuation that make-up is the natural default for women, and going out with a normal, bare face is intended to make a statement, , , just. Very eeeghhhhhhh. But that aside, I appreciate the thoughts about different reasons to want to look a certain way. It is all very complex and entangled in gender identity, presentation, cultural standards, and individual expression. I've been working through these conflicting sources myself from the incredibly confusing enby+ace perspective and appreciated hearing your take on it all."

"This was a really good video with really good questions. I relate a lot to the part where she said 'I'm never gonna know if I'm pretty or not, so I just guess'"
"A book about body neutrality just came out: Beyond Beautiful by Anuschka Rees. The main idea I've gotten out of it is that the way I look doesn't have to be front and center to my life - it can have the same weight as everything else about me. So I can put effort into it if I want, I can feel crappy about the way I look, but I can care about it no more than my other interests/values/talents.

"Holy frackin moly you are so well spoken!"

"Please do a video on fatphobia and fat shaming! You brought it up for just a second in this video."
"As a lesbian I can safely report that #WeToo are concerned about beauty.  The feminine lesbians all want to be called pretty and beautiful. The butch lesbians want to be considered sexy as well.  There's no escape. The aesthetic matters. We all want to be beautuful.   The problem is that the definition of beautiful is always changing, sometimes it is nearly impossible to achieve, and it is always limited to what straight white men want."
"I'm a probably straight white boy born with a chad jawline and It gives me mild dysphoria. From an incel viewpoint it increases my chance at having sex which I want so bad, but every time I look in the mirror I just find it ugly wrong to my identity."

I don't know what else to say really. But I've got this mental-health-alarm that goes off sometimes and I had to beep alarmingly at you just in case it might be needed. *beeps*  Take care <3"
"'Maybe lesbians are just straight chillin while everyone else has lost their minds.' That's soooo accurate. As a femme trans boy with a lesbian bestie, that definitely rings true."
"Something very Simone Giertz about the comment at 20:15"
"Natalie I am offended, I NEVER lie when I say I want you to choke me. I'm dead serious."
"Actually, I think you pass a lot better than most transgender women (in social media at least) because you’re not pumped to the brim with Botox and fillers and still have some „imperfections“. As soon as I see someone who looks like a plastic doll, I think they probably want to cover something up (their masculine features) and usually that ends up being the case."
"As a lesbian, I gotta say I agree 'I'm straight chilling' as do most of my wlw friends, but that's mostly because all of us have been with everyone in our circle and cause...we don't have standards, we just REALLY love women. A lot. <3"
"Why can't it be that women in academia just generally care less about beauty? Why it has to be malicious doings of patriarchal society?"
"If this isn't ok, I apologise and will remove the comment, but I've thought you beautiful the whole way through. I'm happy that you feel more like yourself and look the way you want to."

"ha ha soph has a third more subs than you"
"I..I hope contrapoints doesn’t think all the insta compliments are all shameless flattery. She’s never been ugly or clockable imo. Self doubt is indeed a bitch and its easy to convince yourself people are telling you you’re cute because it’s the “nice thing to do” or whatever. But in the same vein self image is weird as hell, I myself will never feel beautiful unless I change the way I think. Shame and vanity are hard to shake, and people love to accuse you of being vain and fat and ugly or whatever when it’s convenience for them. All that to say keep your head up Nathalie ily forever"
"Love this"

"Main thing going through my head when I put on makeup: 'I am NOT A MONSTER!!!'"
"I appreciated the Gymnopedie No 1. Personally, I have no skin care routine beyond 8 hours of sleep, drinking water, and birth control. I never saw any benefit from mists and creams and gels. YMMV."
"Thanks for this as always thoughtful video. I especially like the bit about style. I'm in the overweight 35+ crowd and due to a period of time in which I was skinny, I developed a sense of style and what works and doesn't work. When I gained weight again, I didn't let the fact that it is extremely hard to find cute things in my size deter me from keeping that up. Even though I went through a real low. Now, I constantly develop a style that works for me, that shows off my strengths. I have 20-somethings in the office copying me now, even though I don't fit into the box of beauty standards. Own the style. I like it."
"First off I really do love this video. It's creative, interesting and I really respect the multiple different points you hit.    Some of my thoughts:    I am a female scientist and I don't wear makeup. For me the reason is because I feel the most myself when I'm not wearing it. I feel (and honestly look) like a different person when I wear make up. If your make up is a manifestation of your truest self, that's awesome, it's just not for me. I do love getting dressed, the problem I have is a safety dress code for the lab and also to be honest, practicality issues. I wont wear rings because I have to wear gloves and I'm not trying to loose a ring because I have to take it off and put it back on lol.    It's I think a balance of dressing as who you are without being too distracting if that makes sense. If I'm at a conference I want my work to be the focus not the way that I dress. While the way you dress shouldn't really matter, it does. We are visual creatures and it does make an impression.     I also don't think beauty is strictly sociological. I have a bias towards biology because I study neuroscience but there is some fact to it. I think people forget we are still just animals and that there's an innate force in us to have a preference of a symmetrical face (just as an example). Where the percents of influence lie I don't know.  I would describe it like a flag, the biology is the pole but society is the wind blowing the flag (our minds/thoughts/feelings) in a direction. Does this make any sense?        I think a lot of the self hate is totally manifested through the internet and people just strait up lying as you said. I think people have a tendency to think they are uglier then they really are, due to comparison and face turn and so much other bs. In reality finding yourself is really where beauty lies. It sounds corney as fuck but what makes you attractive is the you-ist you. Unles you are actually an ugly personality too, then you're fucked lol."
"Oh my God. Natalie, 10 seconds in and I'm blown away but the production quality on this. Amazing"
"can u patent 'chadglow' bc im gonna buy every product immediately when it comes out"
"With that intro I would've thought this was a new Netflix series"
"also, while it is fun, beauty is subjective and fleeting. what lasts in the long run is knowledge. luckily, you have both"
"11:33 'Just this feral cat wandering the aisles of the liquor store.'  Aren't we all, tho?"
"you look so cute and beautiful that it sparks joy in my heart. and if i didn't mean it, i could've chosen not to comment ♡"
"I'm a disabled (fucked up eyes)  cis woman and aside from being blind as shit, I was an ugly duck as a kid and teen so I've heard that I'm an ugly disgusting monster more times than I can count. I tried many times, failed, and in the end  gave up, on trying to fit into glam feminine style and now I have an allergic reaction at the simple thought of wearing a skirt, or fabulous make-up. I've grown to hate both my masculine and feminine traits, because of the weird ass social standards I tried to fit in. So now as an adult in her mid twenties I don't believe any compliments even these from my bf. It's pretty hard to just love yourself these days, and I don't think it's transphobic in any way to want to look as feminine as possible. I myself needed to accept my androgenous traits and start to tolerate that I'll never be the girly bubbly beauty queen that all of my friends back in highschool were.  When I crossplay on conventions and see young girls have shiny eyes, blush at me and ask 'sir can i take a picture with you?' I start to wonder what beauty even is if a cis girl feels beautiful only in these short moments when she goofs around for a few hours dressed as a guy. If you want to look more feminine, go for it. Seriously, no one should judge you it this is what makes you feel more comfortable. It's the least we can do, since I don't think any person truly loves the way they look. I'm about to start making some eyepatches for myself for every possible occasion. If I have to live with asymetrical ugly face, with fucked up eyes, I'll at least have kick ass eyepatches to make me feel better about myself."
"honestly, whenever im sad or feeling down i just throw on your videos (the darkness is a fave) and I start laughing! so thank you for that. i know surgery is very hard so be sure to rest!"
"Fascinating. Hope you find your peace, Natalie."
"Hey there! This is  my first time on your channel, your video was in my recommended and the thumbnail and title caught me!  You mentioned the icky reddit comment, well you totally pass to me! I just thought you had a lower  voice and I've seen lots of cis ladies with lower voice registers  😊 edit: and yes! You're pretty!"
"I know you left your phd program, but tbh you're one of my favorite scholars - your work is so incredibly insightful and honest and funny and thought-provoking"
"Lesbian here. Can confirm losing my mind as well"
"I've missed your videos."
"Yes production"
"in order to progress the disreguarding of beauty standards, we need to be a part of raising a generation of adults who are comfortable and empowered in their appearance. we have to allow children to experiment with their identities and how they communicate that identity visually/aesthetically. We can't judge or shame children for how they choose to express themselves. Break gender stereotypes and norms by promoting appearance exploration in the young. Stop the association between appearance, expression and identity. Yes I've been watching Nina West videos all afternoon."
"Nice to see another great video from ya. Good work as always never fails to impress."
"I have a sincere question. How much does patriarchy have to do with the pressure that women feel to look beautiful? From what Natalie said in the video, it seems like most women want to look beautiful not just for men but rather to feel good about themselves, regardless of whether there are men around."
"Dat intro doe."
"I needed this. Thank you."
"Fran Blanche just put out a pretty excellent response to this, and they both make some excellent points. They mostly have opposite conclusions, and yet it's hard to say that either one has argued badly."

"A contra-point to your 'women wear make-up in women's spaces, therefor it's not for the benefit of men': Most women aren't attracted to the bodybuilder steroid look, but men still go down that road and idolise it, and find ways to work out in prison. It's not conscious, there's a huge competition element, and I find empowermentand control in working out just as you find empowerment in make-up, but come on Natalie: this is about mating whether we like it or not"
"Without makeup you've got kinda a jenna marbles look"
"You're pretty. And you're the type of pretty that makes my brain insist that your name is Jessica."
"I’m 2 minutes in and this is fucking great lmao"
"I love you thank you so much for being Contrapoints, as a leftist there are so few people who are like, accepted by folks/famous to look up to, I barely have any left friends, and obviously mainstream and even social media is filled with folks demonizing us to Tuesday without a second thought of our humanity, and it can feel so invalidating sometimes, but knowing you're out there, fighting the fascists, being smart and funny and having people adore you for it is like finding home. I don't have to be on defense when I watch you, I can frickin relax, and I'm so thankful you've given me and so many others that feeling. Also you're stunning I've been in awe this whole video, and like, all of your videos tbh."
"I like how you brought up body hair. I was watching a video by a trans man talk about how he was finally about to grow a beard to which I thought I know plenty of cismen who can't grow beards even a little"
"Calling your Adams Apple cancelled made me HOLLER."
"Gay or gamer is fucking brutal xD"
"Girl, i think you could rock some bangs."
"I love your videos and have always thought you were beautiful. If I’m honest I didn’t realize you were transgender in one of the first videos I watched of you. Keep it up! As you said the world needs a contrapoints."
"You know, one of the bonuses of having no skin care regime or make up is that you never have to stare at your own face in the mirror. I can literally go days without looking at my face closely in a mirror. Sort of damned if you do, damned if you don't when it comes to feeling like an ugly piece of shit. Yay beauty."
"This is what I would call beautiful."
"People have been telling me to watch contrapoints for so long and I finally did! You are such a good communicator, really good at digging several levels deeper into the origin of a feeling. Thanks for being the voice for those feelings even when they're not the most flattering ones for us to have.  Also you're...quite a haha funny girl 👌"
"Well, this hit too close home. See you. .("

"First time commenter here. You're absolutely gorgeous. Seriously. And this is the first time I've ever seen that style of eyeshadow and thought it looked awesome."
"The suicide rate of people with body  dismorphia increase after plastic surgery"
"As a cis woman who doesn't wear makeup (usually), if I'm honest with myself, I do it because I don't want to get to the point of not liking my face without it. I don't want that to happen. Besides, I also find the process annoying and not really rewarding. It's a bit like when I've dyed my hair in the past: first, it seems cool, but I get used to it quickly and then it's just annoying to maintain.  Also, I find it empowering to not conform to the expectation that I don't like.  But it really has little to do with trying to appear more masculine or belittling other women. They can do what they feel to be empowering. Though I can't deny that I have doubts about all (cis) women choosing 'freely' to wear makeup. Obviously, societal expectations play a role. They also do in my decision.  I also understand how especially people who aren't usually expected to wear makeup (prime example being men) can find it empowering to do so.  To me, makeup is sort of a double-edged sword. I don't want to support an industry that IMO kind of relies on the insecurity of women, yet I understand that it can feel empowering and I especially like that it can be used to express individuality. I just don't like the implication that cis women who don't wear makeup are trying to appear masculine (even though that is not necessarily a bad thing) or trying to belittle other women. For me, I don't feel like that's the case."
"you invented beauty! Perfect angel!       Choke me, mommy"
"This is next level narcissism. You used to make important social issue videos and now we're supposed to listen to 30 minutes of insecure bullshit. Even the Incels video was about your insecurity."
"Just embrace Transhumanism and support a future where we can become ageless humans supported by science to transcend our biological limitations."
"How can Peterson seriously make the make up is an unsolved problem as it brings sexuality into the workplace, while wearing a suit, one of the most sexiest male apparels?"
"As a woman currently involved in academia I have found that not wearing makeup has less to do with it being a power move or not-like-other-girls complex and more to do with being taken seriously.  I've found that if I am wearing obvious make-up (usually not-nude lipstick or eyeliner) professors are less likely to call on me when I have a question (or an answer to one of their questions) and when they do call on me they give very short answers ('don't worry about it', etc) yet with a male student (or female student not obviously wearing makeup) they'll call on them almost immediately and then spend the next 10 minutes giving an in depth answer even if it involves something outside of the realms of the class.  Obviously this does vary a little from professor to professor but it has happened to me enough (and I've heard plenty of similar accounts from other female students) that I just can't be bothered (especially if I know that I have a hard class that day so therefore need my questions taken seriously).  That being said you wrench away red lipstick from my cold dead hands."
"'If all the men died tomorrow......F' xD xD"

"Thanks, queen ♡"
"I feel I only can judge if people any gender whether I find them more or less aesthetically pleasing and also whether they're what would be considered conventionally attractive (like symmetry, close to average features etc.) if I don't know them well or at all. But I cannot tell if I find them sexually attractive or not (whatever that really means). But once I actually know people well or at least have 'parasocial relationship' with them (i.e. have watched them long enough on youtube/films etc that my brain is fooled into thinking it really know them); I no longer can judge how aesthetically pleasing they are. Once I know them, my perception of their personality, i.e. how much I like them outweighs their appearance almost completely. And only then can I some times feel something that might be called sexual attraction to them.    (Is this what being demisexual feels like? Or am I gray-sexual maybe? I am somewhat sexual though cause I am married to a woman I do feel sexual attraction to. But I don't feel that very often at all to others and never towards people I don't know).   I still can of course tell that someone is conventionally attractive or not to some extent; because I can still visually judge things like symmetry and proportions, but I cannot judge how attractive that is to me in isolation because my opinion of their personality colors my perception so much more. And for some reason I usually cannot remember what I really felt about them before I knew them. And since I'm also pansexual I do find both quite feminine and quite masculine and everything in between; perhaps I like androgyny slightly more than the extreme ends; I find it really hard to accurately judge if a transperson is 'passing' or not; since it really don't matter to me.  And since you most definitely are in the parasocial relationship category; I honestly cannot tell objectively how attractive you are to me by looks alone; and even if I'd remembered what I thought the first time I saw you it doesn't really help since you've changed your appearance since then.  All I can say is that to me you're attractive because I really enjoy your humor and personality (as far as I really can tell from your videos); and your face is nice and symmetrical and you dress really nice, but to what extent that is a heteronormatively feminine beauty or not I honestly cant tell at all."
"Geez thats my favorite video. I relate soooo much"
"Do yourself a favor, get the left out of your ear and your brain.  Wanting to be what you believe is beautiful is awesome and most people, including me, want beauty...and no one ever completely accomplishes it and I don't care what gender they are.  We watching this are such a product of a very rich and problem free society that we have to create our own problems and controversies."
"You definitely look like a woman :) but the voice sounds kinda manly"
"Who wathed it while high as a kite?"
"'I want to attract nonbinary people too of course, but right now you guys are kind of getting in the way of my crudely stereotyping people based on gender, so' this is a mood"

"'Once you get locked into a serious skincare collection...'  I have the feeling you are also a fan of the great doctor.   And your production value is off the charts!  I bow to you."
"Thank you for another incredibly wonderful video.  I have been having a rough time balancing my adherence to the beauty norms and my feminism and watching your videos on this topic are really better than therapy.  I think it is great that we can laugh at some of the ridiculous stuff about beauty... Please keep up the great work!!  So much love!  I have recently started to be more public about my transition because I really value the contributions of other trans women before me and I certainly want to pay it forward... some day maybe, some later-in-life woman who is trapped in a dude's body will benefit from seeing one of my youtube videos or instagram posts."

"The camgirl comment make me paused the video so I could scream/laugh properly.  This is so perfect!"
"Obsessing over a beauty standart that you know to be bullshit despite knowing that this is bad for your mental health and not wanting to obsess over it seems to be something every woman goes through in our society. It took me some time to notice how mysogynous it was to resent people for it. Deep down, I was envious because I believed that even all the make up in the world wouldn't make me hate my face less. (I also really dislike bad make up, but that's besides the point)"
""
"I still think that most women look better without makeup – and I'm talking about actually without make up. I still think that make up can be a trap because it makes a routine out of focusing on your flaws. And this feeds into what I think of surgeries: why do all those perfectly attractive people go through this ordeal? I could understand it if they were as ugly as me. I believe that I am far from alone with this kind of thought."
""
"What I am trying to get at is that this line of thinking is wrong and self destructive. There are many kinds of beauty and not looking like that isn't a flaw. Putting on make up is like putting on nice clothes – you seek to express your subjective ideal self and it feels amazing if you succeed. Tbh, I think it'd be nice if men had the same arrange of tools available without being stigmatized."
"you look so beautiful!!!! and in my opinion you pass well!"

"Another insightful video ending on a lo-fi Gymnopédie No. 1 by Satie. I must ask, Points, did you choose that music purposefully? The gymnopaedia was a festival of unarmed, naked war dancing. You stripped down a series of insecurities and left yourself bare. Couldn't help but notice the symmetry or was that a happy accident?"
"Ah, now I know why there was such a gap. Good to see you back Natalie! Now I can get my smart back on."
"'I guess I just want to feel beautiful' -  WHY THO?? THINK ABOUT IT - MAYBE BECAUSE YOUR CHROMOSOMES WANT YOU TO HAVE SEX???? Sorry for yelling, I'm just saying you dismissed Peterson's argument without thinking it through. He's not saying women consciously wear makeup to have sex, he's saying they subconsciously want to be attractive because evolution, and makeup developed in society mainly to fill that role. For sure, there were artistic and expressive reasons for makeup, but the basics are undeniably designed to make you look more attractive."
"I know you touched on it briefly, but can you pleeease talk about the whole notlikeothergirls thing?"
"Thank you for remembering the disabled"
"What if you're a GAYmer"
"If there was a thing as 'objective beauty' wouldn't be all objectively beautiful by natural selection? I think the desire of being beautiful is natural, because of all the positive effects of beauty in ourselves and the way we interact with others. But it's also natural for people to perceive beauty in different ways and degrees. You always going to be a 6 for someone, a 10 for someone else and a 2 for another person. Nature relies on genetic diversity to evolve and survive, so it pushes us to like different things."
"Brilliant video as always. As a cis woman who some people think is/was beautiful, but who never really saw that herself, who is now dealing with - shudder - AGING, I am having all the feelings. (e.g. If you think you're unpretty, you would surely think I'm a lagoon monster.) So true that intellect does not convince feelings. (And sensitive awkward people who 'should know better' maybe also just want to 'win at patriarchy' so we can bash it without it sounding like sour grapes.)"
"The laughter and the tears, you are real drama and thank you for being here."
"Most grad students I know really don't have time for beauty, makeup, or anything not immediately essential for survival and their research. That is, little sleep, no time for entertainment or even basic self care. My husband calls it being a  'brain on a stick'. I have felt the pressure to act in more stereotypically masculine ways to be taken seriously, and know other women in academia  dealing with that same pressure. After all, having a women's name on the SAME resume in STEM often means being seen as less competent and being offered less money for the same job.     https://gender.stanford.edu/news-publications/gender-news/why-does-john-get-stem-job-rather-jennifer"

"ContraPoints, being the youtube-influencer that you are, you are actually doing some good for this world, at least for my personal mini-world (and not just mine). It's refreshing to listen to some in depth-comments/views on your variety of subjects. plus i appreciate the aesthetics and humor <3  I recognize what you mentioned about talking shit to myself, when i want to be healthy, de-stress, exercise, because 'i will look better' (and everybody will like me EEEK *puke-emoji). Stress makes me ugly, who cares about cancer or heart-disease, i don't want the wrinkles! ;)   The thing you mentioned about surgery not helping to reset your mindset and thinking that you are ugly..  well it was plastic surgery, not brain-surgery ;D  I do think you look Even more feminine now, and since that was the goal, i think it was a success. If you need surgery for your thoughts, there are other options to work on that ;) Send you lots of appreciation, for both for  your looks and the parts of inner-you you share as an artist with your audience <3  Ah and yes that 'shirt' (excuse me) seems to be the most divine top my eyes have ever encountered, GORGEOUS <3 Suits you just perfect :)"
"Damn bish yer 30?? You make a smile out of my face, thanks fir the hard work 💕"

"14:19 charts like this remind me a lot about how country songs often describe beautiful women too. Country boys seem to like their girls “natural” with no makeup (yet somehow with perfectly waved hair and perfectly smooth skin), wearing their old hat and shirt, and sexual in a way that is only available to them."

"Not caring so much, can be truly liberating.  Finding a fascinating and engaging hobby would help, I also definately recommend meditation (active curious listening to your feelings with no judgement)."
"Omg, this is my first time watching you and it gave me Black Mirror vibes that I thought I was just watching a character.  And Pikachu 😍😍😍😍"
"You don't need to be Gigi Gorgeous, you're Natalie Wynn. I want you to be yourself, but that doesn't mean you can't evolve. If you want to change your appearance, or even the subject of your channel, you're still going to be brilliant."

"I'm sorry if you feel like you're stuck in a role that you're forced to keep because of the expectations other people put on you. I hope you're able to take any time you need for yourself, and that you have support and love from your friends to turn to. Your videos mean a lot to me, but you matter more than they do.   And... I do think you're beautiful, on the inside and out."

"7:45 this was one of the biggest things that stopped me from starting down this path. to me, blending in and dealing with dysphoria was better than no diaspora and being burgeoning"
"White cis-woman here 👋 I feel uncomfortable seeing cosmetic surgery/other treatments promoted to women across the popular internet. I want to tell women that they can accept themselves as they are. This year, I have not shaved my legs and armpits. I feel comfortable & liberated in my body, but it is still embarrassing to expose that part of myself in public, especially with activities like swimming (where I am confronted with stares from the elderly lap swimmers at the gym). I don't know how long I can keep it up, and may eventually cave to society's beauty standards. I still pluck the thick, dark hairs from my upper lip, chin, and eyebrows, out of a need to fit in. Thanks for making this honest video. I think I shall try more to develop my own style, which may only be a slight shift in the beauty norm. But it is still something on the way to a society less constrained by ideals of beauty--maybe towards a society that values physical/mental health and individuality?"
"okay before I keep going in this video omg you were gorgeous before but now wow omg stunning really"
"Doesn't it seem like at the end of the day everyone just wants the happiness associated with beauty? To be appreciated by others, to feel satisfied with how we look, and potentially to experience any of the added benefits that studies have shown beauty to give us in terms of social and work interactions. Perhaps it's stupid to value outer beauty when 'inner beauty' is 'all that should really matter', but beauty of any kind just seems to be an instrument to gain the intrinsically valuable happiness we all seek."
"I usually never comment on YouTube videos, but this is the exception. I’m so happy for you Natalie!! I hope your transition continues to go well and that this gives you the added confidence to live as the true you"
"A really honest and deeply sincere video.  And intelligent and analytical as usual.  You are doing a huge service to humanism and real science with your brilliant videos.  Your brilliant videos should be seen by many, many more,  so can I make one suggestion on behalf of the older and less-clued-in of us?  Please explain or define terms like 'CIS', 'Chad' 'Becky', perhaps with a little corner of screen blurb, flashing screen or in some such..  I've watched enough of your videos, and those of such allies of yours in fighting the right-wing shitstorm as Oliver Thorne and Peter Coffin  to figure them out, but many new viewers  (well, olde viewers really: they're mostly twice your age)  I've tried to get watching regularly are flumoxed by such terms."
"In spite of what you said, I have to say: YOU ARE GORGEOUS! You were gorgeous before the surgery and are gorgeous now. I'm glad you feel better about how you look yet still are very much yourself."
"Can we stop equating fat and obese with race and other things you can't change. It's incredibly insulting."
"Oh bitch this production quality just ✨✨✨✨"

"“It is amazing how complete is the delusion that beauty is goodness”  - Leo Tolstoy"
"This video honestly gave me so much hope. I don’t care anymore if people think I’m some weird, 30-year-old, cross-dressing tranny male. As long as they know this 30y/o, cross-dressing tranny male is also a _motherfucking vaporwave fairy queen._"
"In my opinion, in order to ruin opressing beauty standards its not enough to just stop looking beautiful in terms of standards. First of all, having an opportunity not to care about aperierience is a privilege itself. Second of all, in case if alt rights totally apropriate a concept of beauty, which they are constantly trying to do, the society is f****d, because beauty makes better populism, unfortunately. I think the best strategical move for us, women, is to constantly mix doing beauty practices with not doing them, constantly adding a little amount of ignoring beauty standards and by that I mean having some days of not wearing makeup, or wearing as little as possible, not shaving etc, but also I mean having famous women who do (god save Contra) and other famous women who never do, therefore normalize both doing and not doing some beauty practices. When the slow smooth process of step by step normalizing is complete, beauty practices may vanish as too hard and unnecessary in first place. People appear to be lazy and that what was always pushing the progress."
"I feel personaly attacked in the parts you are talking in front of the mirror (?  Also, including pikachu dancing 80s music makes me love you more."
"My boyfriend thinks I'm the sexiest thing worth fucking; my tops think I'm the hottest not-girl since girls; my bottoms think I'm the suavest thing since their future much more stable boyfriends.   Why do I already lie about my age on my Grindr at the age of 24? Why do I post thirty candid shots of cats, books, musical instruments, landscapes, and assorted miscellany in between each highly selected shot? Why do  I keep myself from wearing too much makeup beyond the 'necessary' concealing and contour? Why do I agonize over which shades of purple shadow-as-liner plus 20 other shades off the Morphe purple pallet will make me fuckable to straight boys who hate me when the closet boys who love the thought of me don't give a shit as long as I can take the length of them? Why can't I give a good reason to do anything that either alleviates my self-loathing or reassures the ambiguity-loathing transphobes?  Might Natalie have reminded me of the obvious point I thought myself from endless Will and Grace reruns age 11-19: that fashion fades but style is forever?  No; They're wrong; I'm wrong; my makeup is wrong; my TY recs are wrong; the people who love me are wrong; my own ideosyncratic but fairly tame tastes are wrong;   But the ghost of some guy who might hate me, who I just dreamt up, is he wrong? Yes. Is he going to kill me? Probably not. Is truth worth the risk? Fuck it, I think it is.  Thanks Nat! I think I'm trans  and I think I don't hate myself any more knowing that any more than I did before.   I'm super drunk so I don't know what I'm saying but I legit feel like I'm in a braver and safer and truer world after seeing you struggle and work your fucking hardest to make something real happen on the hell screen.  I feel like your concrete explororations.give room to breathe, and that's all you need"
"As a female academic, I gotta say I love the minimal makeup standard. I love having a job where I will probably never be required to wear heels (though I still do for special occasions). However...I also like that there is enough of a critical mass of women in my field that I can wear a top with lace on it or try out some sweet new game of thrones hairstyle without anyone batting an eye, and I love that I now have colleagues I can point to who DO go with the full on girlie look AND still get respect.   So I guess my ideal would be for women to feel like they can enjoy the creative and feminine side of makeup and clothing as they see fit without the insecurities or the pressure to conform...but that is difficult, because those things are a way of signalling group identity, and we are social creatures who usually need to fit in with some group - even if that group is 'the misfits who reject the standards of the larger group'."
"You have a captivating and nostalgic beauty. Kinda like Victoria legrande. I would keep the hair style cuz it works well"
"I deeply appreciate that Natalie is somehow managing to pronounce the 🅱️ emoji in 'millimetres of 🅱️one'."
"I want her sequin top"
"AAAAAAHHHHH SOPHIE IN THE INTRO"
"I clicked right before the video even started, love you 💕"
"'i'm so sorry to be the shallow person in the comments section talking abt skincare.' but y'all should check out derma e's DMAE moisturizer. it's amazing for anti-aging and pore-shrinking.  anyway. great video!!! i have a lot of weird feelings abt makeup and shaving bc of how pressured i was abt it (mostly from my mom and other cis women, interestingly enough), but i got deep into skincare when i was trying to recover from dropping out of college due to mental health. it's so interesting how much skincare is feminized as well. men really look down on people that talk abt the products they use. it's also interesting that there's a large part of me that feels superior to women that wear makeup. even now. even as i admire how a woman looks while wearing makeup, as a wlw. i don't like that i'm judgmental in this way. it's fascinatingly hard to unlearn that ingrained sense that makeup is shallow"
"when this video started and  I heard those first few seconds of FACESHOPPING I literally had tears in my eyes wow ms SOPHIE's impact"
"For what it's worth: Thank you for being ContraPoints.  I spend approximately zero time thinking about my own (white/straight/cis/disabled) external beauty because hey I lurch freakishly when I walk so whatever, I'm not fooling anybody, but I did get something from your conclusion about style. I don't know what I'm going to do with it, but it's something. Glad to hear surgeries went well! (And without that hyperbole you mentioned, you really do look great)"
"As someone who is still very early in transition there is something painfully obvious. Being a girl is much more expensive than being a boy. That said I love when I feel pretty too so it's worth it. I don't impulsively buy video games off steam anymore to fill the emptiness that i felt before I realized what the issue was, so it probably evens out."
"ContraPoints, please make asmr."
"*Rewatches Contrapoints video.* *Nat is rubbing chest sequins.* *Roommate walks in.* I... cannot explain."
"I always thought I was a straight white dude...but want her shirt. I must be gay."
"Great, as always."
"'And then I became what do you call those ladies who make videos oh yeah a CAM GIRL!' LOL"

"I’m cis and I have facial hair because of my PCOS."
"I see the production value has been turned up a notch.  On the topic:  I'm a cis, femmy, sexually-struggling, shy little thing; but I wonder if my experiences may influence you to play with some ideas. My mother was a model. She'd pressure her children to look pretty, to not be fat, to show a little leg, that kind of thing. Now, when I was young I was going through a lot of mental illness due to an abusive and neglectful household. So, my response to this kind of prettifying, looks-before-well-being mentality was pure rebellion. I messed up my hair, wore ill-fitting pants, no bra, baggy shirts - being very contently ugly. I knew what was important. God damn them for thinking my well-being comes second.  Since that uncomfortable teenage time, I have really enjoyed being ugly. Ugly means you don't put any work in. Ugly means you're not living up to your status. Being willfully ugly means there's something you think of as more important. I try to spread this kernel of positive ugliness around - that bit of freedom I experienced - so that women can be happier with multiple aspects of themselves. I hope that I bring it to you as well.  What do I feel like when I wear makeup? Like a clown. It seems overly theatrical, which is fun, but it's clearly a mask. When do I feel beautiful? I love to dream. When I wake up with a cloudy complexion, all puffy and soft with messy hair, I feel beautiful. However, this has recently challenged my point of view: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nEtK80M2Os&fbclid=IwAR0_QeQjkzekHvg87LTaIKoID7I95ZZhCqkyIvsHUhPWkA4bbjg799JJYgI That makeup can be a candle in the darkness makes me want to figure out how I might represent that candle.  'Why the fuck are you telling me all of this?' Oops! I guess I was hoping to give you a different perspective to play with and it didn't work. My bad."
"You’re amazing."
"mother, may i have more asmr?"
"not to add a public comment to your video but you look like jenna marbles without makeup without makeup"
"Subscribed. Beautifully done."
"I have to say, its kind of unfair of you to assume the only reason why women in academia dont wear make up is either because they feel like they have to be masculine in man-filled spaces or because theyre flexing. Is it really so hard to believe that some women dont like it? Or dont think much of it? Truly, you talk as if 'woman' and 'femenine' is inseparable sometimes.   Either way, loved the video."
"it's like that one roxanne gay quote: 'I am not happy at this size, though I am not suffering from the illusion that were I to wake up thin tomorrow, I would be happy and all my problems would be solved.'"
"ill admit that i couldn’t stop staring at the sequins the whole time i was watching this"
"OMG! The music and fast flashing between post surgery bandage face and skull is genius!"
"Wait what's the song at 13:50 it felt very nostalgic"
"I used the dermalogica moisturizer and I love it but it's so expensive!"
"As someone who suffers from depression and has undergone some plastic-surgeries I can state two problems:  1. You usually have to lie in bed for at least a week and usually don't really want to go out and show yourself in the first couple weeks. Isolation and lack of general movement can be a real bitch when facing depression though.  2. The first days/weeks after the surgery you look everything BUT 'optimized'. The first look in the mirror can rather be shocking. Not being able to shower for the first time kicks in additionally at least for me.  All in all you have to find a way to stick through at least the first time till it gets better!"
"'Isn't it safer to just fall in love with them while quietly dying inside?'   This is what the lesbians are doing instead of chilling"
"I wish I felt confident in how to say this, but I don't so I'll just try:  Know that you are loved -- not as a fan loves the target of their fixation, but as spirit who sees the [Hegelian] spirit before themselves. Thank you for the wonderful gift of vulnerable-bravery and honesty and the insight into naming this experience. This is more beautiful than your already pretty outward appearance."
"Jesus CHRIST why are you prETTIER THAN ME AAAAAA STOP YOURE TOO MUCH TOO MUCH WHY ARE YOU SO PRETTY"
"Hi. Fellow Biological female with the shoulders and collar of a linebacker here. I respect my mother for pushing this torso out."
"Wow, auto play lead me here but I loved this. Thank you"
"Yes I've only gotten a third of the way into this video and yet I already feel the need to say.. You look fricken gorgeous, I can really see the difference and it is super natural looking.  I'm so happy to see this because I can only imagine how happy you must be with the results. Without trying to sound like any stereotype able to be eaten up by the internet, if I had just met you now I would've assumed you to be a very polished and sophisticated Cis-female. Wishing you love, sparkles and communistic ideals <3"
"So, she's admitting women have privilege, but not overtly. besides lying and strawmaning."
"omg, you´re so beautiful.  you´re actually so beautiful and brilliant in so many ways, you´re femme-ing up my type! :)"
"I've been thinking about beauty and self image for a good while. As a teenager I was a bit pimply (not too bad anyway) but I became so insecure over it that I kept popping and scratching at my pimples until my face was covered in scabs. So obviously this made me feel like shit. Add on top of that not being fit (having a bit of a tummy, not too much) and yeah, you just keep looking at yourself in the mirror trying to find the 1 second and angle where you think you look OK.   I eventually became super into working out and after 5 years I've realized I'm super happy for the first time with my body because it feels strong. I was born female but was always super masculine about a lot of things; I do have an ass but no tits and my shoulders look a bit masculine so I've always felt like shit over not being 'feminine enough'. But training really helped me listen to my body more and concentrate on finding the shape that fits me best, which is a place in between. Make up wise I beat myself up really badly over how I needed to put on concealer/setting powder before letting others see me, otherwise I'd hide behind my hair feeling like a monster; this has slowly changed over time, although it's still something I struggle with.  Great video btw. I have to say that I was a bit taken aback when I saw your face because trans women going for hyper feminine behaviour or looks always makes me feel a bit shit (because I was born female but could never comply or perform the same hyper feminization, I feel like it's imposed to me... when trans women do it I feel like it's a slap in the face - not that this is okay, and it's honestly just a case of my own feelings, I would never expect any other person to change their behaviour or give a flying fuck about me feeling salty over shit that really is my own problem). But I really liked the discussion. It gave me a whole new way of looking at how trans identities interact with gender roles."
"I LOVE SOPHIE"
"I love you mommy. you're more beautiful than gigi will ever be, the world really need you're better than all of these influencers combined"
"to the point about women wearing makeup even when men aren't looking at them: THere's a sexual component to this.  Basically, enhancing your appearance makes you feel attractive, which makes you feel sexy, which facilitates arousal."
"is your name some kind of reference to communitychannel ?"
"++++ for 'lesbians are just chillin''"
"Ugh what a beauty queen"
"Love your vids as always, but one thing amazes me: why is it so inconceivable that there are women who present as kinda androgynous because that's their *version* of looking like a woman?  That's just what feels natural to them because we all have slightly different preferences regarding our gender style.  We all know straight cis women who are kinda androgynous, same with cis men.  I dunno, I grew up in the 80's when fashion was way more gender-bendy than it is now, so maybe it's just harder for me to see what all the fuss is about.  My point is that it isn't necessarily succumbing to pressure to 'not care' about being beautiful.  Fact is some of us sincerely have a more relaxed attitude towards physical appearance.  Especially if you're lazy like me  - I find it much easier to relate to just going casual, comfortable and low-maintenance because being a princess is too much damn work.  OF COURSE being trans means all the stuff I mentioned would have different connotations, this is just my perspective as a cis woman.  I suppose looking girly means something different when I can take my femininity for granted.  I've never had to prove it."
"For me, being asexual; makeup has always been about treating my body as a canvas. I spent a year in a residential psych unit, and it was mostly female dominated. We got very creative and flamboyant with our makeup  and hair, and it was mostly a bonding experience with each other rather than intended for any of the guys- who often complained about it. I often do more makeup when I'm going out with female friends, than I ever did dating my husband. Grooming behaviors are very much a bonding experience for women, if you removed men completely, I daresay women would get very extreme in their makeup and dress."
"Honey you are beautiful, stop doubting yourself."
"i love you"
"So, I just wanted to say that you mention you've been depressed in this video and honestly you do seem really down. It's clear this is all getting to you a lot and post op depression is really common. If you feel being an influencer is taking over your self image and esteem then I'd fully support you taking a break from youtube, there'd be plenty of people eagerly waiting for your return when you feel ready for it. I love your content but I want you to be happy more, y'know. Don't lose yourself over your commitments to the internet."
"I'm a woman in academia and the expectation that I shouldn't put effort into my appearance to be taken seriously only makes me want to do it more. I'm happy to stand out with bold makeup and flashy outfits and force people to take me seriously by being fucking brilliant 🤷‍♀️"
"My anxiety therapist told me it would be a good idea to cut my skin care routine from 3 hours to 30 minutes and I almost left her office. Then I realized. I think she’s trying to help me lol"
"ur just so fucking pretty jesus"
"Another gem of a video. 🙌"
"your style is on another level + your hair is angelic today <3"
"i have never felt so worried for someone's mental health"
"So awesome <3 I appreciate you and respect your honesty so much"
"Thank you. You've made me realize how some of my desires are genuinely beauty standard related and how others are genuinely my personal aesthetic. And helped me understand why aesthetic, fashion, makeup style, art, are all viscerally important to me, and that's okay."
"thank you for saying van goGGGGGGGGh I love it"
"GENIUS. I fucking love this stuff."
"ohhh Natalie, I love you so much. thank you for always posting such wonderful content. Much love from pdx! xx"
"Those nails are everything"
"Problem is, I think the more money you have, the more power and control you have over creating your own style. Poor people don't have the time or money to be stylish even though they are affected by these standards all the time."
"Well, as a lesbian trans woman, who uses a 15 year old image on her YouTube profile... I wanna be beautiful and feminine my way. And that makes me feel tossed way in any circle with cis lesbian feminists. That 'you don't belong' look. And honestly, very much honestly.... no matter how much I rationalize, no matter how much I think about it.... it hurts. I guess that's being human. And congrats on the surgery, you look amazing :)"
"I don't agree with everything you say, but your work turned out amazing. Congratulations on taking this next step. You're beautiful <3"
"Nat, you were beautiful before, you're beautiful now.  How YOU feel is what counts.  And I hope you see the beauty that I do when I see you."
"The sequin part was wonderful."
"'Is this gender dysphoria or is this internalised transphobia?' is such a great question. Here's to dismantling industries that profit from piling a bunch of shit on top of these issues and making it that much harder to identify and solve our real problems."

"I love how you're boring everyone to death obsessing about petty bullshit in you personal life as we are in the middle of a mass extinction event and trump is president of US."
"Athwart is the word of the day"
"To be honest, you look good and I've missed you for the past month.   With that said, I do not think we can decouple our style from the capitalistic cultivation of our identity. We can't even think something should be a part of our style: we exist in an inescapably global system that produces each and every element of that could be a part of our style.... well... everything. Currently every single commodity exists because of the exploited labor of another: phones, cameras, clothes, food, microphones, makeup.  Well, everything except a plucked wild flower. But the capitalist would say you are stealing their private property and vandalizing their land.   This isn't some burn or gotcha on your video, just a point I wanted to bring up. It's great to see you again."
"I would totally have learned more anatomy at medical school if Lady Foppington was the demonstrator. If the YouTube gig doesn’t work out... you’ve got the correct accent as well! :p"

"Faceshopping is a mind melting track."
"'The Waifu Tier List' was on this video's recommendation bar"
"i relate heavily to your explanation of style vs beauty, that's why i enjoy the 'punk' culture. you can be as ugly or gross or different as you want in punk, you're still accepted. acne, fat, body hair, skin tone, bone structure, etc, doesn't make you 'wrong', as long as you got the style and attitude that connects you to punk."
"This is beauty"
"I'm learning about things?  And laughing my fucking ass off?  What is this witchcraft?"
"The amount of time Miss Point's hairstyle has changed during this video is giving me whiplash"
"Hi, I really like you dress, where is it from?"
"God SOPHIE's music is perfect for your videos"
"It's kinda dumb that people associate makeup with sexual persuasion when we the gays love makeup. It's more of an expression and it's just fun."
"Don't you dare apologize for those sequins. You are awe inspiring."
"God I feel this so much, having masculine features sucks and caring about it feels even worse. Seeing you be honest about that obsession (which everyone has) is quite freeing."
"I've always been ugly and when I stopped caring (because I can pine for what I don't have, or I can get on with my life), things got a LOT easier. Yep, I'm ugly. I'm over it.  I also find it interesting you made a whole video about beauty and never once mentioned The Beauty Myth. While it's problematic from an intersectional POV,  I'm sure, it was the first book that really looked at how the arbitrary and yet absolute ideas of beauty are patriarchal tools to hold women back. Her solution wasn't to disregard aesthetics, but to be comfortable with all types of women's bodies and features and stop placing them in a hierarchy (iirc, it's been a LONG time since I read it)."
"“What’re you gonna do, tell me to watch contrapoints? Kill yourself faggot”"
"omg the skin care routine section killed me"
"Natalie's transformation has been pretty incredible, I have to say."
"Hey, you're probably not gonna read this anymore, bc the video came out two days ago, but overall, I'd just like to tell you something: I could give you a giant fucking pep talk and make you feel nice for a while, but that's likely not gonna work in the long term. You're right, you have to make this out with yourself. Definitely find your style and perhaps, when you feel comfortable with that, you should experiment with your hair, different products especially. But you're not inherently bad or vain for caring about beauty, and it doesn't mean you are influenced by society in some awful way. It's an ok thing to do as long as it doesn't completely consume you and turn into some unhealthy, self destructive shit."
"You look amazing but also THAT TOP AT THE BEGINNING, GIRL, I NEED IT 😮"
"I love the new look. As usual, you've given me a lot to think about. I hope you're going to be OK. You talk about being very harsh on yourself. I hope you have help. Because I don't know you, but I care about you, and I want you to be safe and happy"
"I literally love you and your videos so much you make such informative and entertaining art/essay style videos it's so different and so cool!!!"
"I heard 'brick', I think you mispronounced milkshake."

"jesus fuck your smart"
"Second comment, I just watched a video yesterday about North Korean women who risked their lives just to smuggle in and sell make up. One woman's entire family was sent to a concentration camp where they were tortured. This was not entirely due to the make-up smuggling, but it was a part of it. These women weren't risking their lives to impress men, women just like makeup."
"Natalie, here’s what I see when I look at you. (Not that it really matters, but I’m a cis, white girl who hasn’t really figured out sexual attraction yet largely due to oodles of anxiety and libido-killing meds to treat it starting in my teens. I finally have a degree so I’m trying to take some time to figure myself out. You help with that more than you might think btw)  I think your objectively pretty. You’ve had some air of femininity for a long while now, but it seems to get more refined and natural in each new video. I think your voice may be the biggest “tell,” but that’s come a long way, too.  I know you have image issues, but you honestly come across really confident and comfortable with who you are, and that’s more attractive than anything.   I dance (lindy hop and some blues), though I should specify that I’m not a *dancer* (I definitely don’t exude grace out of every pore). I’ve spent a lot of time watching people and trying to learn from them. There are some incredibly beautiful people that dance. The thing is, it’s not the ones that have the prettiest faces and perfect bodies that draw me in. It’s the people who’s movements seem so perfectly easy, and especially those who just seem to love what they’re doing. There is so much beauty in comfort and owning everything that you are. YOU, Natalie, are funny and smart as hell. You’re charismatic and charming and genuine, and whether or not you feel like it, you seem so unapologetically *you* in a way that I think is really attractive and I can’t quite achieve yet. I admire you a lot. In some ways, I really strive to be more like you. Not because you’re perfect, but because you’re a vibrant, interesting person with some sort of allure that’s both comforting and intriguing. This might sound like flattering bullshit, but I’ve been as honest as possible and I hope that comes across. You make me feel better about my imperfections and help me improve how I approach myself and others, so thank you. You rock, no matter what!!!!!"
"Omg I have no idea what she was talking about and I'm glad! I never considered myself to be pretty but I don't validate myself (or anyone) based on beuty. On the other hand,  I understand how others respond to standards of beauty so usually I purpusely 'perfom femme beauty' (you know, staying fit, wearing the right clothes and make up, etc)  just so I can benefit from others insecurities. I know that's kind of mean but I tried to make other people aware of the fact that conditioning their self-worth on  unexistent standards is delusional and it just didn't work. It's sad really, to see so many awesome people (like her) stressing about it. I wish they could see themselves through my eyes just once."
"Can we get a full ASMR video with that top + nail combo please, thaanks"
"I think you look lovely after the FFS, and I would never have guessed that you were AMAB. But more importantly, you're doing what's right for you. <3"
"I need that surgery done too, even though I was born a female 😑"
"I really appreciate how much strength and moxie it must have taken to still put out a video *in the midst of a depression spiral*. While you were recovering from surgery no less! I know when I'm doing the self-hate loop, it feels like a consolation prize to be like 'wOw, look at me, I did the job/class/project I'm SUPPOSED to do'. But I admire that you still decide to show up, even when you don't feel like it. I'm really glad I subscribed, and I'm really glad your surgery went well!"
"I thought you were beautiful before, and still think so after. Not to invalidate your insecurities; of course you should do what you feel you need to do. But there are definitely those of us out here that aren't exaggerating, have no other motive, I genuinely think you're beautiful. You teach me a lot, make me feel validated, and laugh no matter what alarm my mental head space fire is at. 🥰 💙💜💖"
"You should post a list of your products and what they do.  And...Uh...IDK how you're gonna say you don't have any style while your sets/makeup/outfits are so deliberate, at least in the videos you make.  Like, self depreciation is cool and all but you're gonna make people feel bad with that."
"It’s hard for me to understand the issues around beauty. I grew up to have the body type I always wanted, I put on muscle easily, I have good enough bone structure that I rarely see other men that I’m envious of. Plus I’m just not socialized to compete with men on that level   Thank you for sharing your perspective, I’ll have to think about this more."
"one of the greatest philosophers living!"
"You look great."
"God dammit, i always come away from these videos feeling a lot dumber, in a good way, and amazingly entertained. 10/10 please don't leave us mommy"
"you look kinda like Florence and Kate Bush's lovechild  without makeup! Like a good witch who lives on a mountain and picks lavender flowers"
"I hope you find some sense of self worth in being the most hilarious, on-point voice on the internet"
"Natalie says she has no style. it's like she hasn't seen her own videos, which we know isn't true. bonus points for inspiring others to step their game up aesthetically."

"'The truth is is that this just eats away at me, and I'm losing a lot of time and life to this pain' oh ow lmfao"
"Super interesting. I am a cis female PhD student in an engineering and technology faculty that is very male-dominated. I am extremely feminine and also love being fashionable, glamorous, and beautiful. The notion of wanting to stand apart from other women as an 'academic' struck me. I don't feel that way, but sometimes fear I would be taken more seriously if I presented less feminine. It's very difficult for me, and I also face a lot of boundaries-crossing by my students and colleagues based on how I look. I spend about a half hour on my makeup and 15 minutes on my hair everyday, and generally with immaculate detail. Sometimes I wonder why I bother. And it is exactly that! I love feeling beautiful. Thanks so much for sharing."
"Did I hear a Facebook tag group reference??"
"That intro was fucking awesome. Also I'm a straight dude that really likes this channel! Great job"
"hot"
"'biological sequins' I LOVE THIS WOMAN"
"I never comment and this isn't a particularly hot take but IMO the most captivating quality of ContraPoints videos is the pure unadulterated takes she has on womanhood. Other beauty youtubers DO NOT talk about that dysphoric dread even though the women watching all know full well that it's there. Actual womanhood just feels like unspoken madness half the time."
"Didn't say the word 'aesthetic' ten times. 0/10"
"Pretty or not, it’ll all pass. We’re all but bones and dust."
"Face shopping by Sophie is the absolute best song for this video"
"You look beautiful, girl!!!  But even before FFS, I want you to know that I was very jealous of your looks. You are so gorgeous❤️ I hope you’re feeling comfortable in your skin, babe."
"Grab your gun Grab your rope Bankers beat you into enternal cope Make your list and check it twice Bleeding brokers and bankers is my vice Follow him home under the cover of night Stab all his vitals leaving him dead, without a fight Kill all his children and his wife All as he watches clinging onto life All this talk of sociopaths with fission Freeing the people that's my mission Banker, broker, politician Run, Run, Run Grabbed my rope Grabbed my Gun No longer staggered full of hope Now they're all swinging from a rope"
"So, I'm a public school teacher, and I can't SHOW your videos to my kiddos (largely because the parents would burst into flame if they found out - I get in trouble for using the word 'empathy,' so what the fuck), but I do take some of the arguments you present and restate 'em in kid-friendly language and - they get it. They GET it. Even the cis-white male kids. And they're 13.  Anyway: PREACH it, sister."
"Some people don't wear make up because we just... don't feel like wearing make up."
"youre literally so beautiful i cant handle it ur like forever my #1 celebrity crush"
"Thank you for blessing us with another upload of your insights and perspectives. I greatly appreciate your work."
"Contrapoints qualifies for foppingtons law now lol"
"22:39 Sounds like my girlfriend."
"When’s tabby??"
"love the minecraft music"
"All that being said, you do look good and your face reminds me of winona ryder's. I liked your old nose though"
"I don't believe the reason why women who work in universities do not focus as much on beauty then women in say modeling, a female dominated field, is due to masculan norms of the university. You don't see too men being encouraged to become ultra buff in university either despite that being the masculine body ideal. Instead people who work in inistitutions or professional feilds are encourage across gender lines to focus on their respective feilds and that should be the ideal which they are chasing not a beauty ideal."
"Your videos have been really helpful for me.  I still have a lot to learn, but without the influence of people like you I probably would have stayed in a pretty judgemental place.  And for whatever its worth, I think you look very pretty.  I hope you can feel a little happier about yourself more than once a month.  You deserve it.  :)"
"What’s the song starting at 16:30?"
"Holy shit that was a half hour? Girl i was entranced"
"Mirror Natalie is the new character I didn't know we were missing."
"Is it transphobic if my main feeling about the description of the surgery was 'AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!'?"
"Well now you've just made it weird for me to say you look great >8U  But I hope you can take some of the compliments you receive at the face value. The whole anxiety of appearance and looks are universal (def not implying that it's equally spread as your video discusses). But since I only know ya as the vlogger with a lot of great videos, my compliments ranging from 'You seem like a pretty cool woman,' or 'Guess what, I totally envy your looks :U' can only go so far. Fame is a doubtful bastard. Either way, I hope you feel better Nat!"
"It will all be over soon"
"Gay or gamer 🔥🔥"
"your fucking honesty is everything, also thanks for the full minute of claws on sequins cause that was great. <3"
"I would listen the hell out of a contrapoints podcast"
"You look great, so beautiful!"
"This was depressing."
"What is with people on here constantly calling you queen? Its pretty damn weird"
"What's the name  of Refinery69 doc about female prisioners? I've been very interested in that. I tried to search it on that website, but I did't find it."
"Years ago I was struck by a comment on What Not To Wear. It was a long time ago, so I'm paraphrasing here. 'Never compete with an 18 year old, they will win. Youth has it's own appeal, so they can wear a potato sack and still look good. Instead, be the hottest 40 year old in the room.' Be the hottest 40 year old. If you are going to make it a mental competition, make it a FAIR competition. Just like you shouldn't compare your look bumming around the house at 11am on a Saturday, to someone's bikini vacation in Belize Instagram highlights. You'll just make yourself crazy.  We are always the most critical of our own flaws, because we are the most familiar with them. Even before surgery, you had better than average female looks. Walk through Walmart or the grocery store, look at other women your age. You got this, Hon. Really. Hugs."
"I'm a cis lesbian and 99% of the time I look in the mirror I'm filled with intense self-loathing. Maybe three times a year when I'm groggy in the morning and my self-esteem issues aren't in full swing I can look at my self and be like, 'eh I'm kinda pretty.' I don't even really have a particular desire to change anything besides losing 40 pounds and gaining muscle but I just feel disgusting. I wish my girlfriend would tell me I'm pretty. It's like all I want is for someone to make me feel pretty sometimes."
"MAYBE THE LESBIANS ARE JUST CHILLIN’ 😂😂"
"So, one thing I noticed watching this video was your description about people's flattery being false on instagram, etc. But like. You know that not /all/ of it is false, right? Like I personally find you extremely attractive, before and after your surgeries, but I don't leave those types of comments 1. Your looks aren't the reason I watch your videos and 2. because they can come off as kinda creepy and overly familiar."
"If it makes you feel any better, all the things you talked about with beauty and aging are things every cis-woman goes through too."
"My brother underwent rhinoplasty at about the same time you had your FFS. He seems to be satisfied, but I perceive some of what you mentioned: that people who get plastic surgery expect the procedure to completely fix the mental image, and there is a melancholy that settles when they realize that's not the case. During the same time, I got my first tattoo, with which I am extremely happy. I see how it aligns with what you say at the end of the video, as tattoos are a choice of style rather that a step towards beauty standard compliance. I don't want to imply that the only valid body modifications are tattoos, piercings and similar stuff; after all, the melancholy of my brother is minimal compared to the boost of confidence that he got thanks to the rhinoplasty. It is more of an observation that supports your case, I guess. Good job as always, Natalie, and thanks for persevering!"
"So women wear makeup to attract themselves (not other women)? Lol! It all makes sense now."
"Beauty is CANCELLED"
"Natalie, I truly mean it when I say you are drop dead gorgeous and always have been! Your face looks wonderful! Your style has always been amazing and actually quite inspiring to me as an artist/cartoonist. I’m pretty sure you could pull off a potato sack and crayons marker makeup and I really do mean it. I hope you get lots of love and support!"
"I would just like to say thank you so much for your channel. My oldest kid is trans and watching you has really helped me understand a lot of what he's going through. You're a beautiful person inside and out <3"
"this is the first vid ive seen of yours and i didnt think you were trans before you said so"
"“Feral cat wandering the liquor store” thank you for summarizing my future"
"As a girl in academia (Ph.D. student in electrical engineering) may I just say that most of the time I have only 6 hours to sleep, eat, and watch your videos? I don't have time to put makeup on! :P"
"I would .. ;)"
"I think I’ve found my new favorite YouTuber ever 🖤🌹🖤"
"perfect surgery. changing the profile (a hardly memorised aspect of the face) drastically, whilst leaving the 'front view' (what people recognise as YOU) optically almost unchanged. So, you still essentially look like yourself, but within our three-dimensional reality you look perceivably more female. THIS is how to do it."
"Yay, a new video from Natalie!"
"I really love your honesty and courage!"
"burgeoning jehfdjksehfksef"
"A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G!"
"You look wonderful girl"
"This is the most relatable video I've seen in a long ass time. My face looks like yours pre ffs and I'm a cis woman lol. I need that dress. And I'm super gay for you and this is not an exaggeration."
"As a cis woman I'm suprised I actually find you less visually attractive now. Doesn't affect my attraction to you for everything your mind and lots of hours of work create, though."
"you're so incredibly smart i want to make you a part of any and all educational curricula"
"I think BOTH options are fine. Both options are amazing.   A woman has EVERY RIGHT to make herself ridiculously beautiful. EVERY RIGHT.   I’ll try to stop using all-caps.   And, a woman also has every right to do absolutely nothing.   She has the right to wake up in the morning, take a piss, and say, “Ha! Look at that. Apparently, I was born with a man’s body. And I have a beard. Nobody on earth will know I’m actually 100% female (aside from this rather impressive penis I was born with) until I tell them. (And even then a few of them won’t believe me.)”  EITHER option is right/correct/valid/honest/legitimate/fantastic/unimpeachable because America is a free country and we champion being who you are, being authentic, and doing whatever the fuck you WANNA do.   Being Lady Diana, being Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson, being anything in between, the full spectrum   are all the right option to pick for any woman. Any woman. Any woman.   Any woman.   And anyone who objects and tries to order women around and force them to do something they don’t want to do . . .   is poop on a stick."
"You're beautiful and so funny and smart. Congrats on having ffs. 🤗"
"I actually started watching you because I saw your incels vid thumbnail and thought you were really pretty"
"As a trans woman who is about to get a tracheal shave and contemplating (but leaning against...for now) FFS, you look great and you do you, girl. <3"
"Don't curb your enthusiasm."

"This is just brilliant through and through. From the striking opening to the complete frankness of her description of the experience, this is art by any standard. I am proud and pleased to support it. You're very brave to let the world in, Ms. Wynn. And you're doing good work for so many people who are outside the world's expectations, looking in."
"ughh ur videos are just so beautiful and good if it comes to the commemtary/psychological side  and also I love the skull lady"
"from 0:19 - 0:40, the flashing images overlaid on her face come in 4 colours, which correspond to different categories of subject matter. The first wave is red, which flashes images of the aristocrat from the first 19 seconds, and closeups of the skull at the same angle to the camera as her face.  The second wave is yellow, where there are images of surgical implements and medical scans of heads.. The third wave is blue, and shows pills and medication. The fourth wave is violet/pink, and shows makeup implements including palettes mirrors and burshes. But that 4th pink wave's final image is once again of the skull. I wish i knew what this meant, and whether the sequence of images actually influenced how i experience the video, even though i didnt consciously observe them. Subliminal messaging is a thing right?"
"24:41 'patriarchy'!? Seriously, I am really impressed by your ability to make sense in general, but doesn't the previously featured example of women wearing making in prison and other male-less environments dismiss exactly this simplistic idea of some obscure patriarchal pressure?  Women are all over the faces of marketing material and magazines, not because men consume most of it, but apparently inspire of the fact that they actually don't consume most of these things. I.e. Women care about female beauty just as much as men do."
"Absolutely astounding and thought provoking"
"10:44  ASMR"
"You are fucking amazing girl."
"Oh Contra. I’ve loved you long time and it has nothing to do with your face. I know your self worth is strongly tied to your beauty and femininity, but beauty truly shines from within. We will all get saggy and die one day but a beautiful personality is forever. And you’re blessed with that"
"Maybe you are the reincarnation of oracle Tiresias, that lived both a man and a woman during 7 generations, and the gods gave you the gift of clairvoyance and wisdom."
"What does it mean to experience beauty? Do you look at someone, and experience them as beautiful only after considering whether they conform to social norms, or is it a more visceral reaction? Aren't there different kinds of experiences of visual beauty, e.g. -looking at a sexually attractive person, -looking at a person with striking symmetry, skin tone and bone structure (or, as you pointed out: style) that you appreciate as beautiful but aren't sexually attracted to, -looking at, for example, a person with down's syndrome beaming with delight and appreciating the beauty of their expression of genuine, pure enjoyment of life. etc. Doesn't it make sense to differentiate between these types of Beauty when talking about 'Beauty Standards'?  Is it reasonable to say that every time a woman experiences another woman as beautiful, she does not find her beautiful of her own accord, but is merely socially conditioned into experiencing her as beautiful? And what's with all the comments saying 'omg, u'r so beautiful, don't even say u'r not!' by women, for women? Are you saying their appreciation for aesthetics as a major source of self-worth (as is implied by people who choose to focus on your looks when flattering/consoling/approving of you), is all brainwashing? If the appreciation of beauty is merely a product of social conditioning, what is that appreciation conditioned with (i.e. how can Pavlov condition his dog to salivate at the sound of a bell, without the existence of an intrinsic 'appreciation' for the food that is being associated with the bell)?"
"faceshopping is such a trans anthem thank you for repping mamma sophie"

"Don't skip sunscreen!! The sun is the culprit for premature ageing!!"
"'Beauty standards are arbitrary, social constructs created by the cis white male patriarchy'  'Beauty standards are rooted in markers of evolutionary fitness, i.e. can't be changed'  Any world view that believes one of these statements exclusively, is incomplete. Beauty IS rooted in evolutionary fitness, but complex social structures DO influence what we pay attention to and value. Without accepting some things for what they are we can't grow individually, and without seeking to change some social norms we can't grow as a society. A more productive conversation deals with the details of what should be accepted (and why) and what should/can be changed (and why)."
"Mmmh I don't know about make up.. Most of what human beings do has the aim to signal their sexual fertility and physical beauty. The signal is aimed towards potential partners but also towards peers and society at the same time! We go to the gym to stay healty, yes, but also to feel and look sexy. The same with make up. What Daddy lobster said is not 90% false... His answer wasn't even a dogma, it was a partial hypothesis, and it isn't even uncompatible with what you're saing."
"put a fucking epilepsy warning at the beginning jesus christ"
"Was that minecraft music at the end?"
"Soooo... if it isn't to attract a lover, and it isn't to gain social acceptance, then why do you want to be pretty?"
"Found out I'm a trendsetter: I've had 'facial masculinisation surgery' before term 'incel' was even invented. This because despite being my orthodontist's pet project (he told so myself), he couldn't get my teeth straight due to my massive overbite. So I had my lower jaw lengthened.  I had a head like a basketball for weeks afterwards this relative minor surgery, so I can't imagine how huge Nathalie's head must have been. Especially the part where the bruising (and therefore my face) started turning sickly yellow was flattering.  Oh, and kudos on probably the best American attempt at pronouncing 'Van Gogh' I've ever heard. The first G was still a bit to K-like, but the second one was perfect."
"Holy crap! I was so worried this was actually going to be a make-up tutorial XD I'm so glad that instead it's another very honest and insightful chapter of your book :) I really enjoy it a lot to hear you talk about your thoughts and experiences. I so often wonder about how people see their gender and how much they care and try to look 'the part' so to speak; we all at least try to project an image of the person that is our neurons and some other stuff -- you know the stuff emergent from that, like personality and things. Your point of view gives me plenty of food for thought.   On a side note, you look amazing! I love how the colour of your eyeshadow brings out the colours of your eyes. You have great taste. You are an artist and it shows. I also adore the top! :D I'd be super proud if I ever got the chance to walk into a way too expensive restaurant wearing a tux with your hand on my arm with you looking like that. I admit that I would just love the reason to wear a tux and look amazing myself :p And show it off to you because I know you appreciate beauty.   On a side note of a side note, Your sense of humour always reminds me of my best friend who lives way too far away and I see her far too little. She also has an appreciation of absurdism and she's also very open and honest about herself and like you, she won't shy away from self-mockery to put things in perspective and lighten the mood a little. I can see why not everyone would appreciate that but I love it! The human mind intrigues me maybe even more than physics does and the most fun people are those who can catch you of guard with a great question or surprise you by (re)acting completely different from what you'd expect and give perspectives you wouldn't come up with, and of course make you laugh and feel safe, but that should speak for itself I think. I just feel amazingly lucky with a friend like that."

(and also I'm usually taller than most people.)   I'm not sure if I'm making sense here. it's early saturday morning and I'm not a native speaker. :)   either way: I love you, natalie.

I think I used to think of people who spend a lot of time trying to look pretty as shallow or whatever but now I'm kinda intrigued."

"Here I was having an awesome week and then this video came out and made it even better. You are brave Natalie and we love you. I met a lot of people who didn't see themselves as beautiful, my ex-s insecurity was his height, but a lot of french men are pretty short and skinny, I didn't care about it but he didn't manage to see himself as I saw him, so I get it.   I'm a 5,6 cis woman, non-binary but not super bi-sexual. I never find pants that fit me quite right. But a strange thing happened when I turned 30: I stopped giving a fuck. I just don't have time for it anymore. I dress like a lesbian some days, an insta model some other days and some days I just wanna wear my baggy reebok pants from 10 years ago in public. I don't wanna choose a style, I am all of these people. Smiles I've learned disarm people, so I wear my fucking smile even if it's fake sometimes and I try to make people see me as I see me with my words.   You have a gift for words and you're fighting a revolution while publicly transitioning and I think that's fucking awesome.  What matters is how you feel tho' and I wish from the bottom of my heart that you see yourself one day as I see you. A tall, beautiful, gorgeous, smart, kinky, magical, warrior princess, butterfly. Thank you!"
"I love this, and your conclusion about trying to take pride in personal style to shift the standards from completely external to more internal is basically how I've been coping with seeing myself as unattractive since I was a teenager.

"It took me 32 years to realize despite excellent orthodontic work on my crooked teeth, my thin lips are what make me ugly. Ok that and my nose is wide and kinda weird. And my eyes are too small for my face and my face is too fat along with the rest of my body which is hairy and my hair sucks and I should just give up and go find some bridge to live under already...dammit."

"Some insecurity is perfectly normal, in a human. We need to stop this bullshit, holier-than-thou competition for which leftist feminist can be the most secure in themselves that they can reject all things superficial and potentially tainted by the patriarchy. Of course it's tainted by the patriarchy; a lot of humanity's developments have taken place within the context of patriarchal societies. There's just no untangling that shit entirely, right now. That has to take place over a longer period of time. Like fuuuuuck... can we just breathe and accept that perfect wokeness and being a perfect feminist isn't possible? I'm sick of people online tearing others down over others not being a perfect mirror of their own obsessive, anal-retentive virtues. I mean, I've had problems with anal-retentiveness, myself, and even I'm annoyed with the wokeness purity tests."

"social media expands our inmeadite world beyond what we can know for sure is packaged along with our thoughts and perspectives, believe it or not a single tweet doesn't convey a whole personality and the complexity of your particular worth as a human, so yeah people are caring more about the first expression of the self that will be available to others, and hoping it is sufficiently pleasant to maybe grant the effort of looking for the depth and meaning of that initial presentation, the opportunity to turn a square into a cube. it can't be helped. it's like perfume, it might be ''fake'' but it serves the purpose of leading into the interaction that will put you in contact with the ''real'' thing''."

"here goes the actual three hour monologue"
""
"women can never be free from the concept of beauty, we can focus on struggling with it our whole lives or settle for a certain adaptation of ourselves at whatever level of ''beauty'' it might correspond and move on to focus on other things; the thing is, it's unavoidable having to make a concious choice about it, men may have worries about it at some point or in relation to a specific area of their lives, but for women it's a feature that will be taken into consideration everywhere for anything, that's why treating it as irrelevant is a stand in itself, not the default option, that might be why such a clear distance from the ideal is necessary for career purposes, avoiding the male gaze or so."

"It's annoying but the line between what about my appearance is for myself and what is for society is blurred because for so long the only ''tool'' women had to procure any sort of power or leverage towards men was indeed exploiting their desire to have sex with us, it's become more complicated as women have earned freedoms but what the incels don't get is that, whenever we do take into account our looks and how they relate to men, it's not because we agree with that system, our means to an end is to a different end, a man's end might be the sex but a woman's end is some kind of respect of our agency, simply to not go completely empty-handed into the ongoing conflict with our oppressors, and when we don't give you sex for acknowledging us as human beings with choices, is it really injustice?? given that we didn't want to give you sex anyways?? but shutting that down from the get-go removed our personhood from your perspective???"

"The middle point between conforming and opposing has so many variations too but each brings its own mean assumptions just like the absolutes do:  you can be considered an ugly girl trying too hard, an ugly girl not trying enough, a pretty girl who is lazy and trying to get by on genes alone, a pretty girl who is a waste of potential etc etc etc it's endless and really boils down to the same old misogyny, to how can it relates to the cishet partirarchal worldview."

IF WOMEN GAINED POWER THROUGH LOOKS SO WHAT!! IN THEIR TIMES IT WAS SO HARD FOR A WOMAN TO COME BY SOME POWER  ARE WE REALLY TO CRITIZE SUCH METHODS. YES WE WANT YOUR ATTRACTION BUT JUST SO THAT WE CAN CONVINCE YOU OF OUR PERSONHOOD, GOTTA GET YOUR ATTENTION TO CONVINCE YOU I'M MORE THAN A VASE, AND IF I REALLY WERE A VASE AND YOU BROKE ME WITH YOUR PENIS U JUST GO AND GET ANOTHER VASE AND WOW DID BEAUTY AND ENGAGING SEXUALLY WITH YOU SERVE ME IN ANY WAY THAT WASN'T EPHIMEROUS SUBJECTIVE AND REDUCTIVE OF MY QUALITIES AS A PERSON, I SURE PLOTTED MY WAY TO THE TOP THERE  HHUUH."

"Your struggle with beauty sounds rather a lot like a cousin of the bulimic or anorexic  struggle. No matter how much they purge and starve themselves, there never is a pinnacle or a point in which they are satisfied. It's sisyphean. When does it actually stop being about 'passing?'  If making these videos is taking such a toll on you don't be afraid to take a break or stop altogether.    If you don't have a therapist maybe finding one would be beneficial in dealing with cycles."

"vulnerability is beautiful i see you"
"I personally think you're just stupid thinking about make up all the time. But fuck me, right? This video was pretty alien to me, as I don't wear make up at all. But cool beans, anyway."
"Welcome to the same level of self-perception induced misery as everyone else Natalie. It has no racist, ageist, other 'ist' biases."
"Natalie,  I’m a cis male. I’ve always been firm in my masculinity, HOWEVER...  Since discovering your videos I’ve been able to more fully realize the nuance and fluidity of what it means for me to be a man. I continue and likely will continue to identify with my gender assigned from birth, but you inspire me to break from the rigidity of my gender expression. I’m much more willing to be flamboyant and cross the lines between what is deemed feminine and masculine by society. I’ve also gained more courage to directly confront my sexuality. Thanks, at least in part to you providing a bit of a second sexual awakening for me- a renaissance if you will.   You’re looking more gorgeous than ever. Thank you for inspiring me.  - A young man whom you’ve awakened in new ways."

"Do you think you would still want to put on makeup if say you would be stuck on an island for the rest of your life and no one else will ever see you, but you live comfortable in luxurious facilities and have all the makeup and clothing you can ever want."

IT IS WITHIN REACH, WOMAN.' (To clarify, I personally wish my jaw was more defined where it meets the ear, but obviously a cis lady of my ancestry ain't getting that naturally).  I hope you are closer to your inner happiness, Natalie! I'm keeping you in my thoughts and wishing you the best of luck for the rest of your days!"

PS: For those who like me, can't stop obsessing about impossible beauty standards, look up the Kibbe System and the Twelve Color Seasons System as well. Seriously, it was the only thing that helped me to stop my pretentious brain rationalizing self-loathing to see that through these techniques I could achieve some type of beauty that fitted me, and for the first time, I felt I could see the beauty I see in others in myself. It also helped me to stop comparing myself to beautiful people I had nothing in common, which was basically an addiction of mine, and to set my eyes on people who looked more like me. So here's this tip."

"As someone that's never understood why people care what they look like this kind of helps explain it. Sort of. I actually still don't get it. It just seems like a whole lot of effort for nothing. I'm probably too much of a nihilist. Or lazy. Or narcissistic. Or all the above."

"Love this video !"
"I think the last remark in the video 'I guess I'll just have to cultivate intelligence, kindness, and inner beauty - eww' really gets at the heart of the matter. People know beauty standards are oppressive and limiting, but they are still emotionally entrapped by the messages associated with rejecting those standards. Rejecting them feels like something that only gross, ugly people do out of necessity. The reality is that while there may be some correlation there, it's the 'beautiful people' that are missing out on deeper, freer, and more fulfilling relationships in life.    I say that as someone who still wants to be and be with the 'beautiful people' but wish I could reprogram myself to feel differently about beauty and physical attraction. I actually do think it's possible, it's just extremely difficult and takes a long time. I don't think the answer is to just throw your hands in the air and decide 'well, I care about this stuff and I can't help that.' One can be compassionate towards oneself having and/or acting on that impulse (guilt is pointless here) without abandoning a commitment to becoming less shallow over time."

"Bumpin sophie!  I feel it"
"How do I ~love~ this video???"
"Wow, yet another slam dunk of a video. Just wanted to say your videos have been crucial to my transition as a trans man and this video went to a whole new level by helping me realize that I spent a lot of time and effort when I was younger trying to be a beautiful 'girl' because I thought that would make me happy. However, as I moved away from that idea of self expression, I found myself feeling more authentic the more I saw a man in the mirror- this video really helped me understand how that experience shaped me and my own journey towards living a sincere life. Good luck finding your truth!"
"The point you mention at the end about creating a unique style is very important in exalting the desire to be beautiful from something mundane to something quite sublime. This is true, as it recontextualizes beauty as something that's very individual and unique to the individual as opposed to something that's inherently competitive like attractiveness. When I was a teenager, I very quickly got overwhelmed with playing the beauty game and I became a rebel with my own style and no one dressed like me. So, instead of trying to reach for something unattainable, I made myself very strange and beautiful in my strangeness. And I think my teen years were a lot smoother because I could treat that situation with a sense of detachment, even if there was a lot of denial going on at the same time.   But even though I didn't completely transcend the influence of the beauty standards of the society, there was something elevating about it.  And there was so much more empowerment to be had in the strange personality-laden beauty that I had created that made people see me more as a mystery, an artist, an oddity, a rebel, and ultimately an individual whether they liked it or hated it.    So, I'm now 30 years old, and in my early 20s I went through a process of 'vanillification' to blend into society as an adult working a 9 to 5, which brought me back down into the fray you find yourself in of comparison and competition and fighting the losing battle of time and significance that women face in a uniquely threatening way. And that forced me to stand face to face with the pervasive shadow of feminine beauty standards and my desire to fit them and all the pain and insecurity that comes with it.    But I am now finding my way back to the kind of austere beauty as my youth leaves me while also honoring my desire to be conventionally beautiful. And I really resonate with the archetype of the witch, as this is an empowering archetype to own at every age. It also helps that I'm a Youtuber as well, as I am my own boss. So, I can be as I am without having to cleave to the conventions of society as much. So, I feel a lot freer to color outside the lines in many ways. But I know that that monster still lurks in the darkness somewhere, and I'll have to face it more and more every day. Hopefully, I can learn to love and embrace that monster. But it's hard because it's nothing less than the fear of death and insignificance, that simply expresses itself through beauty and the ancestral memory of objectification that effects everyone in society.    Godspeed. This one is difficult to transcend. You have to let the proverbial hag devour you, and that's hard to do."

Symmetry, anything that signals health and reproductive fitness. Beautiful people will still privileged after the revolution. Wonderful message about style though."
"Boner structure."
"Yes.   Also, I hope this doesn’t make you uncomfortable... I’ve found you attractive both pre and post FFS. It’s a confusing time for me."
"SMART and beautiful!!"
"Beauty, like most human pursuits, is a blade capable of slicing the fabric of reality, or, misused, of slicing your soul into tatters. The only question is, are you able to wield it without destroying yourself?"
"Okay, I just need to say that I have developed a massive crush on you. You are so witty, and your humor really appeals to me, plus your videos are so entertaining and thought-provoking. Not to mention how beautiful you are."

I think so very highly of you and you say things that my bi heart feels on a deep level and you give me hope over all. I really appreciate saying all the things I think when people tell me to try make up again or that my insecurities are unfounded. Why is there so much of a split between what I desire vs. my feelings that I want to be hawt so bad?! Thank you for wording my feelings."

Dude bro, professor contrapoint thank you, your group effort was solidly entertaining bc it’s funny and the love for the aesthetic was there in action as in title.

""
"once again, thank you so much!"
"You're wonderful and wrong; you definitely have a style. The aesthetic of your commentary and humor are just as impactful as the stunning visual aspects I can see in your videos. Also, you have an incredible skill of more effectively articulating what I think and feel about a lot of issues. So thanks for that."

"Even your Swedish man-crush and my delusional headache The Golden One is overly concerned with 'Aesthetics' and 'Male Beauty' ('I think Pierce Brosnan has pretty eyes!

"I avoid all of that by accepting that I'll never be satisfied with my appearance, that I'm not beautiful and won't ever be, and then with that out of the way I proceed to be lazy and not put any effort into my appearance. I'm ugly because I _want_ to be is a great way to dodge the criticism of others and feed my self-loathing, especially since there's not enough hours in the rest of my life or money in my bank account to get a therapist to root through my myriad of self-esteem and body image issues."

"where’s the ads? This is great"
"@Contrapoints You mentioned that you've never cared about your appearance and being beautiful. But I think that at least some part of you knows you are beautiful (unlike before) and that's why your expectations have risen. Because you now compare yourself to people you consider more beautiful than those you used to compare yourself to (because you are now a woman and comparing yourself to women on one hand and also because your own perception of yourself has improved). But improved perception of oneself, it seems to me, is actually not mutually exclusive with having your self-confidence shrink, because that change actually also entails a change in the scale of things, and thus is relative to it. Greetings from Bulgaria! (also, you are breathtaking and I cannot help fetishizing and idolizing you, so surely that must mean something, right?)"

"Having watched all your videos in the last couple months I would have to say your stuff has both been very enlightening and insightful but your journey has been really posative for me to see happen. I hope to continue to see the amazing videos you make in the future"
"Well if you want an honest assessment (which you prob don't from a ogre like myself) I preferred your looks as a man, can tell there's maybe something up, but wouldn't out you as trans right away. The makeup and overall effort you put into the look means you do look better than most people on the street going to work or whatever.  And that really is the key, you pretty much put it best 'a six' but with effort and skill you bump it up and not only pass but look better than a lot of women.  Whether or not I'd want you to choke me is irrelevant. I'd let Gilfred Godfrey choke me and step on my neck  And yes I am aware of the fact that this is coming from somekne"
"your 'bad skin day,' is better than my good day lol. i truly wish you could see how cute you are.  i highly doubt i can help you with your self image issues, but one thing that helped with me, personally, was not focusing on each individual 'flaw', and realizing those are negligible compared to how you look overall.   i also realized that outside media influenced my standards more than i thought, and that it didn't actually make you really gross just to have cellulite on your legs or some acne. i also began to notice women with wrinkled skin and greying hair who were attractive. having a perfectionist perspective takes away from appreciating anything for what it is.   i guess the more, 'woke,' thing to say is screw it, stop caring about looks, but that would be useless imo."
"you're really beautiful and hot both before and after"
"Another thing I'd like to tack on is that people treat me way better with a full beat face. Everywhere. No matter what. Every time I go out it's with the generally same smile, style and attitude towards things (at least on the outside) I do my best to keep that mask on the front to protect myself,  you know? 'If you have a bad attitude you'll attract bad attitudes.' kind of thing. I still find that people are way more rude, mean-spirited and dismissive of me if I'm not wearing makeup. It doesn't happen literally every single time, of course, but more often than not I have bad run-ins with people when I'm not wearing my mask. I love doing makeup, it's literally my job, I just really hate that people treat me differently when I decide to look like a standard human, you know?"
"This lesbian is straight chillin'... but she also knows what it's like to feel intense dislike for your own body. I'm fat, I have a strong jaw, my nose isn't perfectly straight, hell, I spent eons worrying about the fact that my fingers weren't long enough to look dainty and elegant. I worried that no man could ever love me, yada yada yada, and while I did eventually realize I had no interest in a man's opinion, before that I realized that the things I saw as fatal flaws in myself were things I would barely notice about another woman. Flabby arms? Soft, great for hugging. Same with chubby bellies, and I could wax poetic about thick thighs. So if it helps anyone else to try to turn it around - look at the women around you, then ask yourself if you'd noticed their 'flaws'. Then ask yourself if you're in the habit of assuming everyone else immediately notices and criticizes those same 'flaws' in you.   And if the answer is 'I notice and I care, and seeing a slightly (or substantially) different face in the mirror would make me happy because that face would more closely match how I see myself'. (Or 'My ability to look cis is integral to my safety, whether mental or physical'.) Then do what makes you feel at home in your own body.  Just consider your view might be tainted by society first."

"STAHP reminding us that our relationship with you is only parasocial :'(    Seriously, though. You're right that we do wear makeup for ourselves. I'm an asexual woman who has never been interested in even dating - but I like green/blue eyeliner. I'll even wear it when I'm at home by myself. It's pretty much routine by this point - I feel naked without those two little lines on my eyelids.    The 'original' reason I started wearing makeup at 16 was because I was sick of people thinking I was a school aged child...a frustration I still experience a good 10 years later. I just wanted to stop getting patronised and spoken down to because I 'look like a child'(plus I did NOT enjoy being asked asked 'WHY AREN'T YOU IN SCHOOL?' and having to reply 'I DON'T GO TO SCHOOL, MR RANDOM OLD MAN. I JUST GOT BACK FROM A 12 HOUR SHIFT, LET ME WALK HOME IN PEEEEAAAACE').    I didn't start wearing it because I felt ugly or sickly(though, when I look back at photos of myself in those pre-eyeliner days now - I do think it), and not because I ever got told I was ugly - I was pretty fortunate in that nobody called me that growing up. But...ultimately, you could say I still did it because I was tired of society judging me on my looks in other ways. And then I grew to enjoy the 'escape' away from being so patronised for my babyface(plus...I kind of can't stop wearing it now because I like making my green/blue eyes pop even more than they already do...it turns out. Yes, I like staring at my own eyes when I'm in the bathroom alone - call me shallow. It's fiine)."
"It breaks my heart when I see such a kind and intelligent person suffering from internalized social standards, but if I am to psychoanalyze myself, I'd say it is I who I feel sorry for. Thank you for being out there in all your non-conforming glory. I don't know if it helps you, but it helps me and others like me. Stay true and kind to yourself!"
"I’m right there with you, always on the fence. Both having a multiple step skin care routine while also feeling like Im being vapid for caring about something so surface level. I’ve decided to cultivate my own ideas of beauty instead of letting someone else’s ideas take over my aesthetic standards, which I was taking on as my own for so many years."
"I had extensive jaw surgery like 15 years ago (the full Kanye) and I couldn’t so much as put chapstick on without a mirror for like 7 years. And always felt like I was drooling."

"Straight man here: you’re extremely attractive."
"I am only 5 minutes into the video, but I paused it to say this.  You were always, beautiful.  Now your outside more closely matches your inside, and for that I am grateful and happy for you!"
"I don't invest in makeup and beauty stuff not because I think I'm better than anyone or trying to be 'one of the guys,' but because I don't think I have the resources or ability to reach the optimal place I'd want to be, and not reaching it feels more like an 'incomplete' than a 'partial success' to me. I pour attention into my hair and knowing pop culture bullshit instead"

"Your distinction of style vs. beauty struck a chord with me that I didn't really know I had. Being fat, I had always tried to find an 'angle' to get people to validate my appearance in other ways. I'll never be beautiful but I can be cute; I'll never be beautiful but I can be fabulous, on and on. Like you mentioned, presenting yourself as caricatured versions of femininity to overcome societal judgment is a coping mechanism learned by those with body dysphoria of all types. Thank you so much for making this video <3"
"Great video, as always, but I'm not sure that beauty is entirely socially constructed or that style is entirely independent of social influence."
"I love you"

"SEQUIN PATTEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRNNNNNNNNNN I'M MESMERIZED edit: btw, As A Cis Woman in academia, I can tell you that I don't wear makeup because who got the time to learn and do that when a) there's an extensive array of ~ nerdy hobbies ~ to attend to, and b) pursuing a career in academic research is apparently _juuuust a little bit_ about sacrificing your youthful body and precious evenings/weekends/holidays on the Altar Of Science, but I admire and envy people who have truly mastered the art of makeup so. fucking. much. I would put that on the same level of being fluent in an obscure, intricate, cool-sounding foreign language that comes with its own writing system"

"“If all the men died tomorrow, I’d definitely keep wearing makeup. Heck. I’d probably wear more.”  If all men died tomorrow, I’d probably start wearing makeup. A big reason why I’ve only put on makeup 4 times in my life (3 by personal choice instead of my mother dressing me up) is because I get enough harassment as it is. I’m trying to fly under the radar to avoid gropers and stalkers.  Not that it’s actually working. But I’m not sure what else to do."
"Loved this from the first second - just looked up beauty on youtube and this was first and best suggestion. Gosh I hate my face"
"the beauty community: in flames ContraPoints: ...so here's my skincare routine"
"To be fair, Natalie...academics (esp. grad students) rarely have time to put on makeup. I try to paint my lips and glitter my eyelids before going to class...but sometimes I oversleep and don't have time, sometimes it's a toss-up between doing my face and having breakfast...and I realize it's a long day and my body needs nourishment, etc."
"I'm straight chillin'.... can't do makeup."
"This is a super interesting video and part of an important conversation, but I just want to talk about how cool that eyeshadow looks. Nicely done."
"ContraPoints is much more experienced in life than me, so I don't feel I should be giving any advice. Still, I feel like since most of her beauty problems derive from her inner feelings and not exterior (since plastic surgery didn't make her feel any better), maybe instead of changing her face, she should change her perspective of how she looks. I know that what I suggest isn't an easy task and that it doesn't change societal standards of what beauty is, but by redefining what beauty is to you as an individual, you can change how you see yourself. Simply by finding the features on your face that you do like about yourself, instead of focusing on what you don't like about yourself through apps like Facetune, and reminding yourself of them, you can start to like your face more and more."
"I loved the fear and loathing in Las Vegas reference with 'once you get locked in to a serious skin care collection the tendency is to push it as far as you can'"

"Grad student here, who wants to look beautiful again! I got lazy...no make-up, nailpolish, all black clothing... i'm working on it. :)"
"Will you be my friend?"
"Not to completely miss the point of the video... but yes... you are stunning 😁"
"It seems like you're trying to justify a lot of unhealthy thoughts by thinking that women inherently want to be beautiful."
"This is one of the most interesting and underrated channels on YouTube.  Well done"
"Ugh I fucking love everything you make Natalie choke me mommy"
"Thank you for being Contrapoints. I'd do something to support you beyond subscribing on YouTube, eg Patreon, but I need to save up so that I can get my hideous teeth fixed."
"Ironically you look more soft and feminine without the heavy makeup."
"Contrapoints is like a fine wine   pairs well with cheese   but in all seriousness, glad recovery is going okay and best of luck rejoining internet society   Cannot wait for the potential eventual video on non binaries (as a non binary)"

"11:00 The Inherent Eroticism of the Sequins™️"
"I don't think Jordan Peterson was saying that women wear make up to be sexually attractive to men, but that is why make up was invented, the reason for blush is to look sexually flushed, the redish and pink lipstick similar reason. Women now may not use make up with that specifically in mind, but that is the original purpose of the make up, it seems mostly now that women wear make up to compete with each other on looks or to avoid scrutiny from other women."
"It’s amazing how much better one looks when one pays someone to cut ones face open and fix the fuck out of your bad bone structure"

"see you at DragCon!"
"The whole video was brilliant but I'm kind of obsessed with that intro, I keep rewatching it. _v e r y  a e s t h e t i c_"
"SOPHIE x ContraPoints!?!?!??"
"As a transmasc person who spent the first 22 years of his life not caring about his looks (read: ignoring his body because of gender incongruence) this desire to be beautiful (my fragile masculinity prefers to use the words 'good looking' and 'cool') is a very new thing for me. I actually have sort of a skin care routine now and I don't just throw on the first clothes that I can grab in the morning. I used to feel weird about it but now I embrace it because feeling beautiful is a good feeling and I'm basically in my puberty now so I get to be obsessed with my looks."

"Wheeewwwwww what a PROCESS!!!! You look fab. My level of Princess Paranoia is such that I could never handle such a transformative process. Fascinating!"
"ALSO can we get a gotdamn product list from that routine?????"
"ART."
"I think part of the reason women who don't wear makeup and masculine fields are correlated is because fields where women are EXPECTED to wear makeup act unfriendly to women who don't. The fields where there weren't as many women to start with don't have that reaction, because makeup is serving as an intersexual social cue, not a general one; it's radical enough that the person doesn't have a wiener, doesn't matter if they have product on their face or not! Then, that builds up over time. There's definitely also an element of feminists pushing for more women in those fields at the same time as the anti-makeup rhetoric was getting really loud, and consequential passing down of that memo between generations of women in the field, but I don't think it's as strong a factor as you're initially noting.   (Posted this take inside a comment chain too, but felt like it belonged out in the open)"

"'hi sistercels' this is my first time here and it's been a lot to take in, but this had me dying. subbed"
"beauty is subjective just like art.  It doesn't last and ultimately is pretty pointless.  When people talk about the so call inner beauty is really just personality and other such thing that are immaterial that I cant think of at this moment.  To me beauty is purely physical.  Now I get femmine transwomen wanting to be beautiful as possible.  Which I think its part due to societal pressure that's on women, and the gender dysphoria, and the whole self inflicted transphobia I am unsure on."
"Is... is... is that beauty and the beast music I hear?"
"Pro tip to beat the slow decay of time: keep decaying body parts out of your intestines!  Yes, the vegan propaganda machine has made it all the way here, but only because it would be so sick to see ContraPoints serving an authentic vegan glow to accompany her fresh af queen-shaped skull."
"godDAMN Natalie, just when I think I can't love you and your videos more you shock the SHIT out of me. The beginning of this video was jaw-dropping. You keep upping your game every time and your surgery was so subtle and flawlessly done. You kick fuckin ass all day er day and you make me happy as fuck. LOVE IT.  I had to edit to say 'feral cat wandering the isles of the liquor store' is just... it's poetry."

"I spend a lot of time in an academic sphere, and most of the women in my field (with the exception of a few), look down on the things I do to try to make myself look 'traditionally beautiful' (AKA makeup, nails, whatever)."
"Something struck me when you said that you were going through adolescence again on camera. I remember in my mid-late teens being obsessed with beauty because it was new, exciting and felt like the refined, final pokemon evolution compared to my awkward-ass middle pokemon stage. But a decade later in my mid-late 20's, I'm not too concerned about encompassing beauty all the time because it's a facet of womanhood I've already explored. I'm invested in other things like...a mortgage, a good healthcare plan and wondering if marrying is worth the tax benefits. Lol. Transitioning now truly is second adolescence, and I'm thinking perhaps, with time, once you've thoroughly explored that part of womanhood, the insatiable need to be beautiful all the time will wane."
"the video starting off with sophie was a wonderful surprise"
"I definitely hear the point about everyone caring about beauty.  I'm a 35 year-old straight cis man who's been overweight his whole life, and I've got so much internalized hate for my appearance that decades ago I subconsciously decided the only way to deal with it was to adopt the mindset of Tyrion Lannister, 'wear it like armor.'  Basically, I decided since I was never going to be viewed as attractive, I just wasn't going to care.  It's only been in the last 10 years that I've actually started trying to take care of myself appearance-wise, and while I consciously know I'm not inherently unattractive, that internalized negative self-image just never goes away.  So when you talk about looking at yourself in the mirror and never seeing how pretty you are, I totally get it.  Cis/trans, man/women, binary/non, straight/gay, we all struggle with this shit.  Yay society!   Also, I fucking LOST IT at the pikachu bit.  Damn that was hilarious!"
"yes! yes! yes!"
"This is so smart and curious and vulnerable and wonderfully written...   Also, you're definitely pretty."
"Clearly, you need to become an ascetic and shed yourself of all your worldly possessions and wander the Earth until the end of time UwU"

"Style... So thats the word I was looking for 'individual beauty'... It describes the phenomenon perfectly."
"I was wondering where you went!!!! So glad your recovery went well, you look wonderful!"
"Oh, and I swear this is the last comment and I'm not spamming you, but now that I'm in my late 30s I much prefer the compliments I get from other  females than those I did from straight men.

"I'm nearing 3 years HRT. Despite passing (as strangers' reactions imply, at least) I feel FFS would improve everything immensely. But at the same time... I've seen ciswomen with stronger brow ridges than me. With more body hair. Anything that feels like a weak point. And somehow, with time, you can come to kind of just... own it. Objective masculinity is stripped away from it as a quality. Femininity stereotypes definitely erect steeper standards, but if you can start to see through them, it becomes a lot easier to meet and accept the way you are. And as you do, it's easier and easier to realize 'I'm a woman with these qualities,' rather than those qualities themselves.  Keep on, Natalie. ❤"
"I completely lost it at 'Hi Sistercels!'"
"I feel guilty for making a comment solely about your appearance when the whole video is so well done, but you could be Celine Dion's twin."
"I loved the video but your comment about the reasons women don't wear makeup in male dominated fields was really weird... I'm in a male-dominated tech field and I feel like being unattractive does not make men take me more seriously, in fact quite the opposite because dudes have no incentive to even pretend they listen to what i'm saying compared to the more attractive workers lol. I don't have a steady hand and any attempts I've done with makeup made me feel less attractive, which is why I don't do it?"
"1. I'm cis and straight and I don't shave. 2. I'm a doctor and I get serious salty looks cause I have blue hair, and full makeup in daily. But it makes me feel like I give a shit and it's my creative outlet. 3. Omg don't do that to your sequins! You could mess up the design 4. I'd love to see you do a tutorial for real."
"I bet you Probably think i could never be neutral about this & that's just not true.  but you are beautiful, & smart, & funny, & can do no wrong cause you're perfection Damn it! ... I fail at critique .. I'm Sorry Natalie."

I'm a cam girl (an actual cam girl, not a YouTuber heh) and I film x-rated clips. I have to constantly look at my body while editting these, and honestly it really has made me more hyperaware of my flaws. Glad this is a relatable thing and I'm not just a TOO sensitive bitch, lol"
"You know it's weird, I've never had a bare face in any profile picture of mine, yet I never wear makeup in daily life. I only wear makeup when it's a special occasion (which is when I take profile pictures) but I'm perfectly fine going about my day with nothing on my face.  Maybe the reason I do so is that I *don't* want to be desirable to men. Of course, as mentioned in the video that's not really the reason why women wear makeup but I think it's safe to say I'm less conventionally attractive without makeup ergo less men will find me attractive. Any time I've worn makeup and feminine outfits I've noticed more men pay attention to me, which makes me uncomfortable af so I guess it's baggy clothes and no makeup for the rest of my life lmfao"
"when someone gets into the process of making a compliment it is (to my opinion )beacause they like what they see.If you ask someone 'do you like how  I look' they might lie about it , they will say ''yes you look great'' even if they don't mean it so as not to insult you.But when they comment about it by their own I don't see a reason why they would lie.I wouldn't .but we must be humble"
"lately i've been thinking a lot about how little sense it really makes, from outside our societal context, to treat 'you look beautiful' as a compliment. call someone pretty and they immediately go 'thank you!' like it's an accomplishment. and don't get me wrong, if someone, for example, spent two hours doing nail art and i compliment their nails, it is 100% their accomplishment. but when someone looks gorgeous without trying, isn't it absurd on some level that the conversation automatically goes 'you look lovely' 'thanks, that's so sweet of you!'  does this make sense? am i just being peak ace? or maybe it's just the overflowing bitterness in my heart from remembering my nine year old self getting her little childish heart twisted up by pressure to use make up and wear crop tops, or from every single time a man winning some award is called onto stage and introduced as 'the talented', while his female counterpart is introduced as 'the talented, and exceptionally beautiful'. either way, for me personally, beauty matters less and less the older i get, across the board."

Ah well, who needs the real thing? I only date 2D. (strokes a picture of Natalie lovingly)"
"To escape my personal doom spiral of mentally constantly tracking and  fussing over how good I look, I have started paying attention to the paradox you also mentioned. The practice is to notice the two conflicting sides in me and make peace with both of them, by reminding myself that I am a multitude of selves inside and some of them believe in the societal beauty standards I was born into, while others consider themselves beyond such petty and vain concerns. The better I can sit in this gap of paradoxical weirdness, the smaller it gets, the more compassionate I can look at these parts and smile inwardly. It is okay to feel this way. Most of us do.

On the other hand, I feel hatred towards my body and would love to cut the fat off with a butcher's knife and manually re-align my jaw. I'm not sure how much of it is societal pressure or reality. I know that I feel ashamed when my partner says I'm beautiful, because I love them so much and they deserve so much more."

However, don't get addicted to it! When people find out that you are transgender, they'll fucking whip out their magnifying glass and critic every single detail on you. They miss the forest for that one single tree...and you'll start to do the same on yourself. Sawing off that one dead branch is one thing, cutting down the forest to replace it with a tidy park is another. What I'm trying to say is that, don't be afraid to be the woman you already are."

"I never comment on anything anywhere, as I am a 33-year-old theater school dropout and escaped mental patient that spends most of her time staring at the wall trying to decide what “it” all means, but I wanted you to know that representation does matter. So thank you, for speaking on behalf of those of us that are in a constant state of existential ennui. For helping us feel less alone, for giving us the feeling that our erratic where’s-the-point voices should be heard.     But really, what is the point? Who are we? Is it art? Have I failed or succeeded because I’m so woke? Wait, am I woke? Am I woke because I’m not sure how woke I am? Am I beautiful because I have no idea what beauty MEANS?? How long is coffee good after being brewed? I should brush my hair."

"I find it fascinating how even models and celebrities can struggle with insecurities about their looks. The modeling industry doesn't just give normal woman body image issues, but models themselves can develop issues. Cameron Russell called models 'the most physically insecure women probably on the planet.' Having your looks photo-shopped all the time doesn't feel great.   Also, praise from fans can have its own drawbacks. There's an episode of Justin Baldoni's Man Enough where they talk about body image issues and how positive reinforcement can become a pressure and create an expectation for them to constantly look good. Justin Baldoni himself gets plenty of compliments on his looks from fans, but even he considered getting cosmetic surgery."
"You were always pretty gorgeous and that didn't seem change much :)  Oh no I'm doing the Parasocial crush thing again."
"I... didn't even notice the difference... oops..."
"Natalie, you are so pretty! You would have ruled my high school (class of 1969), and you make our homecoming queen look like shredded crap. But as a 67-year-old woman, I can only tear up and nod in empathy when you talk about not feeling pretty enough. Sweetie, I am here to tell you that the day will come when you look in the mirror and think, 'Damn, I am gorgeous,' and it will not be a fleeting thing. What is the secret of my geriatric beauty? Is it the acceptance and wisdom that comes with age? No. It is macular degeneration! I look fabulous all the time now. My skin is flawless and, honestly, I look as good as I did at 30.  Enjoy everything you've got, girl, and be assured that you will one day get to revisit the exquisite physical perfection that you now embody (and erroneously deny), in time to wow them at Bingo. Perfect beauty is attainable if you can slowly and simultaneously go blind."

"I used to wake up 2 hours before I had to leave for work to make sure I could complete my makeup routine, eventually I realised the benefits of looking slightly better wasn't worth the time and effort I was investing in it. It wasn't making me happy, I still wasn't as beautiful as i wished I was. I now feel more comfortable in my skin than I ever felt when my life revolved around making myself look beautiful. There's a big difference between between putting on make-up because you like the way you look with it on and putting it on because you can't stand the way you look without it."
"This is one of your best videos and it helped me think about a topic that generally just leaves me feeling queasy and uncomfortable. Also, you look stunning. <3"
"Tatiana westbrookova wow that’s a niche meme"
"CUNTY"
"I love that you highlighted the chasm between flawed mentalities and having our desires constantly out-edging them. I think that desire is something rarely acknowledged in terms of making social change. Maybe it's because we've been hammered with 'facts over feelings' but acknowledging a feeling is just a fact in the end, isn't it? I dunno. I'm just as much at a loss as you are when it comes to my fears of aging."
"that fear and loathing reference <3"
"Thank you for the F in chat. Very cool."
"Just want to throw out there that I find it interesting how similar and different FTM experiences are from MTF. (I am FTM, pre-T & pre-Operative, and currently contemplating both). It is so different starting at the experience of being raised as a woman than it is going into the experience of becoming a woman...the way that Patriarchy and internalized inferiority functions both so similarly and differently. I dealt with a lot of what you are going through when I was going through first puberty when I was a teenager. Anyway...it's strange that the various operations that FTM people get are not, in my experience, seen as vain, whereas the equivalent surgeries for MTFs are seen as vain. It's so strange because it almost demonstrates how the Patriarchy functions on stereotype and appearance. Despite being 'biologically female' as an FTM person, I am not seen as vain for getting surgeries done that will make me feel more beautiful/whole/me. Whereas the opposite functions in a way that frames these surgeries as vain / excessive to a degree / fixated on beauty. I'll be thinking more about this!"

"Honestly, what you said about women in male dominated fields is very true. I am currently going to a tech-school for 3D animation. There are only 20 people in my class, 4 of which are women, none of whom wear any type of feminine clothing or makeup but have expressed a strong desire to. I am nonbinary and masculine aligned, and most of the time I worry if my gender expression is linked to my desire to go into a field of work dominated by masculine people. At the same time though, I worry that if I explore my femininity I will not be taken seriously."
"Great video as always. Just commenting that the surgery looks like it all went awesome. If I saw you on the street (cishet male gaze, if it matters), I suspect if I didn't recognize you from your channel, I would have never thought you'd had work done (and yes, it if it matters, you would pass). Thanks for what you do on here. I learn a lot."

"14:44 You would expect that from deeply ingrained biological behaviours. If you're a female in pre-agricultural times, you're always around your own tribe, thus you're always in the mating game. There is no evolutionary incentive for there to be an inbuilt 'on/off switch' specifically for that type of behaviour."

"I wish for you to have a circle of friends and lovers, and a whole tribe who appreciate you truly for who you are, no matter what you look like. When I grew up I didn't know a single female bodied person who let their body hair grow, now I'm surrounded by gorgeous hairy women and the gorgeous men, nbs and women who love them. I have never felt more at home in my body than with this tribe of people, and in this bubble I don't even feel dysphoric. I hope you've made/will make this experience too."
"You're right, lesbians are chill about this and let me tell you why, since I am one. Well, I really don't want men to find me attractive, since they gross me out, and I know women will find me attractive cuz lesbians are so rare and everyone is so starved in the lesbian dating world, that when they finally find a decent looking woman to date, they jump right in. So, yeah, I'm not worried about looks."

"I want to be beautiful because it makes me feel good. I generally don't like how I look: I'm overweight, my face is kind of... lumpy, and I feel like my head is too big. Sometimes, however, my hair might look extra nice or I might be wearing pretty clothes, and I'll be able to look in a mirror and not think 'ew'. Feeling beautiful gives me a little confidence boost."
"Maybe unpopular opinion but I think you're beautiful without makeup."
"I love the point you make about style! I sometimes feel I rely a lot on style in order to compensate for other things... Either way, I absolutely love your shirt! And your face too."
"Fantastic video but there's one bit that bugs the hell out of me: the constant 'people are liars/deluded by parasocial bonds/etc' joke to invalidate positive feedback. Like, I'm not saying parasocial relationships are weird or that fans' feedback should be taken as gospel, but the implication that any positive comment is dubious seems to me like more a projection of your own insecurities than anything else. I mean, you go from 'every other trans women on youtube is a goddess' to that statement, and like…are *you* lying when you say that? I mean, it's a hyperbole, but when you compliment another trans woman in particular, are you generally being honest or not? And if you are, why assume you're the only one who is? Maybe the issue is you've spent too long on forums like 4chan where sincerity is basically taboo, in very much the same way as the black-pilled incels who, in your video about them, you described as rejecting anyone who makes positive responses to someone's post. Then again maybe I'm just psychoanalyzing a complete stranger and this whole comment is parasocial bullshit. I don't know. Just seemed like something worth thinking about.  Also, unrelated but 'what's going on in my head?' *dancing pikachu video* was amazing and extremely relatable."
"I only wear foundation and powder to cover up acne, but I’ve worn mascara a few times for special occasions and loved it (my sister and mom always helped for those times haha).  I guess I just never felt like I had any natural beauty for makeup to accentuate. And I’m also deeply afraid I’d do something that looks like shit (but I think it looks nice) and other women would judge me for it or something...idk I guess that’s prob just my social anxiety talking  Also, when I was younger, I had a very boyish face and I hated the way I looked - I mean I still do _most_ of the time (not all the time like I used to). But I’ve actually started looking more like a woman - fucking **finally**, I’ll be 21 in sixteen days - so maybe I’ll start wearing more makeup"

"This video is painfully real to me, I’m a chemical engineering major and one of the handful of women in my class and of that handful, I’m the only one that ever wears a full face of make up. Usually What those beauty gurus call a “natural beat” except with winged liner. Because of this I find myself in a weird place where I’m taken less seriously by male peers, yet I also find that they’re nicer to me than any of the other women and when they talk to me I’m regularly subjected to that comparison game a lot of men do where they try to complement a woman by insulting other women around her. It’s absolutely infuriating."
"Video starts at 6:20."
"The part about men liking more 'natural' makeup is sooooo true. Not only that, I've expierenced it from A LOT of people around me. I like to have days of over the top makeup and then of a more natural one. I keep hearing my familly, some friends, some of my mum's friends etc say that I should stick to the natural one, 'cause I'm a 'pretty girl'. Honestly, it's just sad, also because that kinda implies that makeup takes that away from me. I wanna get colourful hair - that's childish. I wanna get piercings - ew, just don't. I'm blessed by also having friends and a wonderful boyfriend that incourage me to be who I wanna be, to look how I wanna look.   I was always told from strangers and familly that I was a 'pretty girl', though I never really believed it. That might be, because I have a lot of alergy-related scars and open spots till now, but it started when I was a child, so some kids were afraid of me, which always made me feel bad about myself. Also, even if people from my familly were calling me such a pretty child, a lot of them were terrified of the state of my skin (including for example my mum). I was also told a lot by my dad that I was fat, because of having no muscle-structure. I was never into sports and I'm just too lazy to be, even though that is haunting me 'till this day. So a lot of my life was feeling like trash about my skin, my weight (I was never really overweight, exept for a passage of time when I was about 10kg havier than I am now and I hated how I looked and felt), I didn't like my face... even the things everyone around me complimented didn't seem that great. The way I felt about my body goes beyond that, too. I was insecure about EVERYTHING I did. My state of mind this year was so bad, I couldn't stand it. I had such an identity crisis and one night I cut my hair short with scissors that are supposed to be usued to cut nails. Through everything though, I finally had the courage to dress how I wanted, do my makeup as I wanted, as I just didn't care. Almost everything that happened to me in this time was just awful.   Idk why I wrote all of this, oh well :')."
"Damn girl, you’re so pretty without makeup, which you are not wearing in this video. Also do you wanna come on my debate podcast Free Speech Radio?"

"I loved when she talked about being able to judge whether others are pretty but it being impossible to gauge our own prettiness and how we can be constantly changing our minds about how we look and can never truly trust anyone else’s judgment as they’re probably lying  I feel like thinking about whether or not I’m beautiful takes up a ridiculous amount of my time and I’ve never heard someone articulate why so well before."

"The first time I came across Contra was by the inecel video and due to circumstance, my viewing was spread over like 3 days. The section that she said she used to be a man I was really surprised. It didn't seem true, she seemed so female as if she was never anything else. And even after knowing that, Contra was still my femme ideal.   I didn't have any understanding of the Trans community beyond vague acceptance.  I've learned a LOT from queen Contra as well as being entertained."
"People like you make me feel somewhat glad to be such a self-destructively careless and apathetic pile of brutalist rubble. My face is covered in acne scars and I won't do anything about it, because go fuck yourself. I have more important things to worry about and I will not spend hours upon hours doing skincare and makeup. Instead I'll spend hours upon hours hating people because of my deep insecurities. But that's still better than hating yourself for not being beautiful enough."
"It's very brave of you to go through surgery Natalie, and I think you look wonderful. If you look pretty and satisfied to yourself though, is all that matters, and somehow I've been blessed with the dumb ignorance of thinking I'm pretty 24/7 even if I'm not."
"This is some high quality shit."
"For a long time I earnestly thought i couldn’t be pretty. I felt ugly and thought not caring made me punk or something. But in college I realized I really wanted to be pretty. So bad. I don’t have time to wear makeup everyday, but I do it whenever I have an excuse to and sometimes I just do it for fun in my dorm. I started buying clothes I actually like, i cut my hair for the first time in TEN years, i got wigs, and I go to class feeling cute af. Before this i had little motivation to lose weight, and its dumb and vain but my greatest motivation to get thinner is to fit into more cute clothes. I’m seeing it as me trying to physically and aesthetically the person I’ve always wanted to be.  In high school I thought lolita was beautiful but could never wear it. I know now that at that time there was actually a lot of lolita i could fit into and it hurts now that I’m too fat to fit into these gorgeous clothes😔 But the changes I made now make me so much happier, and I hope this happiness helps me love myself more and take better care of myself.  Thank you for this video. It really vocalizes little things that have been bubbling in my head."
"vanities vanitatum indeed!  the characteristics of external male and female beauty derive from deep-rooted biological indicators of reproductive health, with an overlay of cultural preference... and then there are the fashion-dependent antics of prettifying (think powdered wigs and whitened faces of the Baroque; the blackened teeth of the court ladies in the Japanese Heian period; facial hair gardening for men, and so on)  body beauty is fleeting, fashion is fickle... beautiful minds and generous hearts are forever... just try to maintain a healthy body and transfix those around you with what is inside you, you are doing great as you are!"
"Can someone list the people referenced in this video for some of us oblivious folks. I'd like to understand the context better. Thanks!"
"19:17 lol I feel personally attacked  Guess I’d better quit “Naval-Gazing with Natalie” and go perform my actual job. I’ll just put these silly feelings in this cute little box and keep playing on easy mode, hopefully make a difference.   I mean I actually managed to snag a job in the field I studied and might end up helping effect the kind of change that I’ve cared about since childhood. I’m probably a fickle, ungrateful bitch for worrying about myself when I’ve got this opportunity right at my fingertips."

"17:00  Non binary dark subculture person here.  Not so much my face, but THIS with my body.  Is it too fat?  Too lumpy?  Gross?  Or normal for my age.  Just hit menopause and body has changed.  Swear all the mirrors in my house, window reflections when I am outside, fitting room mirrors are all different.  I have NO idea what my body REALLY looks like.  It is ok or am I a fatso?  And, that changes daily.  Am I just body dysmorphic?  Or do I need to just ignore all the media images and don't let it drive me totally nuts?"
"If it helps, my very straight very oblivious male partner will walk in the room when I'm watching your videos and say 'who's this lady you're always watching?', so I think you can probably trust his opinion that you look great, lol."
"SCRIPT ADVISOR THERYN MEYER LMAO this busted up tran is still around?"
"How do you know if you're beautiful?"
"Natalie, you may not even read this comment, and even if you do it may not change the way you feel one bit, but...   If you think you're not beautiful, you're clearly not in a position to judge beauty, because you're gorgeous. That's the big paradox of self esteem. If you have low self esteem, then you're not qualified to esteem.     I could go on and make a very misinformed presentation about zen buddhism but this bottle of whisky isn't gonna empty itself, so..."
"I’m not really on board with the insinuation that women not wearing makeup is always (a) a power move in the workplace or (b) a not-like-other-girls flex. Can’t women just exist without political motives being assigned to everything they do — and even things they don’t do?"
"I fucking love you."
"I'm a cis woman but i genuinely want to be as beautiful and strong as Natalie"

"Hi Jenna Marbles, your videos have really changed. You've taken inspiration from Philosophy Tube?"
"If your academic classmates are like me, I wonder if it's just another response to the beauty pressure: giving up.   Sure, there are times when I make and effort and feel pretty (well, more along the path to pretty in any case), but that only makes the self loathing worse later. I've even made an effort not to hide some of my faults because coming to terms with them seemed like it might work better (hardly). And in the end, no metter what I do I'll never be able to come close to those who have practised for years to look perfect. I look like a pig in make up. And even if I did become an expert it would all be for nothing, because the experts hate themelves too! We all play to lose.    Anyway, you do look gorgeous. 30 is no age to talk about the ravages of time and you'll end up a magnificient dame anyway."

"It's funny, you're the second trans woman I've been watching pre- and post-FFS, and both times I didn't really notice (or even believe!) there was any difference in the 'reveal'. I'm so used to the 'Real Housewives' style of plastic surgery that makes people look less like themselves, creating an uncanny valley feeling of not quite recognising who I'm looking at. But from my perspective, FFS does the complete opposite, and matches people more closely to the image I already had of them in my head. It's a huge difference, and yet it's imperceptible."

"It's similar to the problem of obsession with realistic graphics in video games. People want the best possible graphics for new games because they like the way it looks and that is fine. But after a while games with only good graphics with start to look outdated compared to more recent titles so people judge it for that. To prevent this from being a problem you have to create a consistent style or aesthetic for your game like with Wind Waker."

"You're 33? Holy shit"
"Hey Natalie, I really like your videos, I'm glad you are back!  This video was so personal and honest, and I felt a little sad... It made me think about my own relationship with beauty. I have never cared about beauty culture too much (I'm an average looking non-binary person, I don't like makeup and my style is a disaster).  If you read this comment, I just want to tell you that you look very pretty to me, in the conventional sense. But I think people look truly beautiful when they are happy, like when you laugh at your own jokes, that's very cute. I think sometimes is wiser to don't think too much about it, because if we obsess after our apearence we only see defects, as you already mentioned. Maybe one day you will feel really beautiful, in a careless sense, and you won't put much thought into it. I wish you the best in the future <3"
"Gettin' top surgery in two weeks. And to tell you the truth, if my breasts weren't sexualized by society, and used against me as a 'gotcha' by transphobes to point out my inherent ~womanhood~ then yeah, I'd probably be cool with them. But that's not the world we live in. Props to the transmasc people who are cool with their chests unaltered, but not me."

"This only further proves my opinion that BDD needs to be given more attention amongst psychologists. For those who don't know BDD stands for Body Dysmorphic Disorder. It is a mental disorder that affects about 2% of the population, is very similar to OCD and is characterized by an obsession with a delusional or non-delusional flaw or flaws. Symptoms incude a general feeling of being unattractive or ugly, a fear of rejection based on your flaws and spending hours obsessively trying to fix your flaw or neglecting that part of your body altogether. BDD has the highest rates of suicidal ideation and attempt rates out of all mental disorders with 57% and 22% of patients respectively. Another danger with this illness is that plastic surgery doesn't help and can either make you more obsessed and unsatisfied with the result or make your BDD move on to another body part. According to a questionnaire amongst plastic surgeons 1 in 5 people who seek out cosmetic surgery have BDD. Now, finally, plastic surgeons are considering a mendatory screening for BDD before taking on a client. Please, if you're reading this and think you may have BDD, seek out help! I was diagnosed last year and the past year my BDD severity has dropped immensely. It gets better."

"Well, congratulations! IMO your prevoius look was as pretty as the new one, but since passing was the goaland it works - it was totally worth it."
"asmr"
"Thank you for doing this. I’m not transgender, but I have body dysmorphia and I have been struggling with an eating disorder since I was 9 years old. This hits so close to home. If you ever find a solution to this bullshit please let us know.   For the record, you look like a beauty from a Sofonisba Anguissola painting (or do you? I could be exaggerating and you’ll never know)."
"Contra, you look great. I think this video is really shitty though. I hate that you said that fat arms and cellulite are ugly. If you're going to be a woman don't be a shitty bitch ok? I love you and I'm sorry this video is so bad."
"you are amazing!! found you through Stef (breadmom) on Twitter! gonna go watch your other videos now! :)"
"So why do you never talk about your family? Where do you come from? How did you grow up?"
"The only thing that made me realize she is a biologic man it's how hilarius she is."
"the whole video i was like oh GoD please touch the sequins with the nails and then you have me a whole asmr moment ~~___~~"
"Damn, you look good with heavy or light makeup. And I thought that before and after this video. ... I'm genuine dammit!"
"just yesterday i had another hour long meltdown about which bikini to buy because i couldnt figure out which one would make me look sexier, so this video means a lot. it's very well put and painfully relateable. while i hate the beauty industry and instagram culture with a buring passion, being the absolute hottest person in the world is still my #1 priority and my inability to live up to this arbitrary standard i set myself makes me extremely angry at myself. and the self awareness truly doesnt change anything. at this point im not even sure if i hate the beauty industry out of concern for my fellow women and girls or if i just want everyone to realize the futility of beauty so i alone can strive to be beautiful. this video makes me feel understood and also made me laugh. the points you made about 'beauty' vs. 'style' is something i hadnt counsiously formed out in my mind yet and i feel like this might help me. thank you, mademoiselle points :) i stan!"
"I think the idea of style as a way to combat not feeling beautiful is actually quite profound. It's something that my wife has said to me before and we were both really happy when you suddenly echoed that sentiment. She's said she rather wants to look fun than beautiful, by for example wearing clothing that is colorful or stands out a bit more. It's a way to take power back from how society thinks you should look and decide for yourself what works for you instead of feeling like you're reaching for an ideal you'll never get to.  Thanks for the great videos as always. You make a difference."
"Lookin like Celine Dion on a journey"
"'starfish night'😭😂"
"It doesn't matter where beauty standards come from, only that they exist. The specifics may change, but it will never be a #inclusive thing, because it's contrary to the very nature of standards. We will never honestly believe the 'everybody is beautiful' mantra, because all of us have our own internal standards , and we obviously don't consider everyone equally beautiful.  The erections don't lie. What we want is that the 'official' standards to be changed to benefit our particular characteristics."
"What the actual fuck? You’re disgusting"
"Contra is honestly the only YouTuber I’d invest countless hours in watching and rewatching every video. You never cease to amaze me, Natalie (and not just with your intelligently well-articulated theses and subtly addicting humor but also w o w you are so gorgeous it’s hard to look away). I hope I one day can be as influential on someone’s life as you’ve been on mine. Thanks for being you, can’t wait to see what you do next. 💕"
"Girl, you look amazing and your commentary is enlightening as well as engaging. Also, I loved your Dr. Thompson reference quote."
"I'm a male cashew and I can relate to everything you said. Also by now I feel almost ready to kill if that meant some people would come onto my profiles, telling me I were gorgeous, I really don't care anymore if it's hyperbolic or not (and let's be honest, it would). ....really, I'm starving over here."
"You DO look great, hun. ;-) I always thought that you were a very pretty woman (and I dont know if that is something you want to hear, but I also thought you were very handsome when you still considered yourself a guy).  But you know, I don't really like to tell youtubers (especially ones that are video-essaying), that they are good looking because it just feels like i am objectifying them while it is really their personality and thoughts that they want me to comment on. So if you want to hear that, I will of course say it more often, because it is true. And that you are intelligent and funny and talented makes you even more attractive.  It is hard to come to love oneself and find beauty in oneself and at least accept your own body, for me as a cis woman, but I imagine, when you are transitioning it is even harder. Some people never come to that point in life. So I really wish to you that you find the beauty you already have."
"What a beautiful woman. More importantly... a beautiful heart."
"Ok I love you"
"I think you are beautiful. With or without an eve's apple. If we are ever in the same country at the same time I would like to go on a date with you. Please don't think I am creepy but you are my main girl crush. You are so smart and funny and clever and and you can teach me how to be feminine because I can't woman at all."
"'Eastern asian people who are doing double eyelids surgery.' like, no, no... that's so racist😨.... there are eastern asian people who are born with natural double eyelids and those are quite different from Westerners'. if we wanted to look more like white folks, we probly tryna have creases but we don't. I don't know about how Natalie think about that since this is a quote from an another person and I haven't watched the video whole through."

"I'm lesbian and I don't wear makeup or dress up bc I'm terrified of attracting men. every time I dress up men speak to me and it's scary bc they often won't leave (ye I love being followed by a man down several streets, totally not fearing for my life). I don't know how to be femme in a way that attracts women. lesbians in the comment section pls tell me how to do this I'm so lost. I'm so close to just shaving my head bc I know men generally don't like that"
"I actually miss anti make up feminism. Now it seems every other feminist reference is super confy wearing professional levels of beauty-enhancing make up. I better not even say what I think about plastic surgery.   Still, great essay as always. It would have been better with a no make up, no shaving, regularly clothed feminist character, though..."

"As a woman whose skull looks more like your pre-op picture than post-op... I don't know what to feel right now. But you did make that point in a lot of your videos... Society already accepts me as a woman, while you have to claw your way up to that acceptance. And yes, the tightrope I walk every morning between wearing too little and too much makeup to work is real."
"You’re pretty. No really. Now shut up about it."

"I smiled every time Pikachu came on."
"Natalie, thank's for engaging with this complex topic in such a detailed manner. It's complicated. I would say you noticeably made your nose more conventionally attractive. But I don't think it was ugly before and aren't there lots of women who don't have conventionally mega attractive noses? As you say, it seems like a relevant part of your obsession with how you look goes beyond gender dysphoria.  I usually tell people that cosmetic surgery is just super expensive and feeds into an unhealthy mindset. But I can also kinda understand it, because I've been too fat my whole life and as a kid I had my gyno-tits removed which were a source of intense discomfort (maybe not unlike gender dysphoria?) and the doctors convinced me that there was nothing else I could do about them. Though it seems like that was not true and I could have tried to sweat the breasts away with years of intense workout regimen. Now, obviously that does not apply to bone structure, which can only be 'feminized' by surgery. But in the same way that I wonder if I shouldn't just stop waging the decades long war against being overweight and learn to accept myself as I am, I also wonder if a trans-woman accepting herself as she is wouldn't be more effective than surgery in the long run. You yourself said that you may never find yourself beautiful enough, which does sound a bit like the mindset of an addict. It sounds like you should get out of it.  Much love"

"'lesbians are just straight chillin' yeah. although lesbian fashion revolves around what straight men DON'T find attractive which results in chaotic fuckboy outfits and I find it hilarious also help i owe too many snapbacks now because of this"
"maybe women wear makeup to stop other women talking shit about them? ive never in my life heard a man say 'her makeup looks terrible' or 'jeez she should wear concealer' or whatever it is.  heard women say that and more, however."
"Please please please allow me to add another validation message for you: you are an amazing editor, the best channel on YouTube, powerful in your messaging.... I'm forgetting something. Oh! Yes! Beautiful! Because the most impactful beauty is achieved by a combination of getting sucked down the societal spiral of beauty expectations and doing SOME conforming (in a very personal way, hah!) but also having a stunning personality."
"I cant believe SOPHIE invented face shopping"
"I'm not a 'fan', I like your reasoning and logic, the editing, the colours (Where can I get that 6000 sequins top, holy shit its amazing), the list goes on. I think you look pretty. What I dont get is why you drink so much alcohol (atleast thats what I have an impression of) if you want to look young? Also, fasting slows aging."

"a youtube video thats license SOPHIE, what a time to be alive"
"You're worrying me. The type of internet-cutting you said you used to do in the Incels video, I feel like you're beginning to do again in subtler and deeper ways."
"Great to see you make some progress with being at peace with yourself. I come to your channel for that very direct and honest style as well as the aesthetic. I feel a lot of empathy for your suffering, but nothing I can say will make you feel less suffery, so I disassociate ever so slightly when it comes to that. Just like with climate catastrophe..."
"Love the song choice at the end. I’ve been obsessed with this song for a year."
"As I am a new viewer, and therefore consuming in reverse, it sometimes looks like I’m watching a beautiful woman transition into a handsome man. In any event, thanks for making politics bearable again!"
"I was thinking at first I didn't want all that much done, but I've since reconsidered.  I need more than rhinoplasty to look how I feel like I should."
"SOPHIE OMFG YES EUSHHWHWHS"
"You’re this cis bisexual *FEMOID*’s dream girl and I say that with 100% honesty, not just bc I’m a fan. All fax no printer 💕"
"One perspective that came to me while watching this video was during the part where you spoke about who you want to be compared to what others or the world needs(tied together with how this channel started). I understand that there's a lot of humor interwoven into this and at the same time I'm thinking to myself: in the case of Youtube channels that have individuals with certain philosophical/political views(that have a big crowd of fans that support the content creator financially). What happens the day when the individual/content creator change their opinion or want to do something or be something else in life?  Maybe a weird question nevertheless I really enjoy your videos/content. That question has recently been in the back of my mind."
"The solution is pretty uncomplicated tbh. Went through the same journey(minus the publicity), didn't leave my house more than once/twice a month because I felt ugly. After about 5 years of that you discover: 'oh hey, this constant cruel shit I keep saying to myself in my head? maybe that's actually making me feel worse about myself!'. Revolutionary, I know.   You don't have to use constant 'im gorgeous'-mantras or learn to love yourself(which is way too high a target at first), but if you at least stop yourself when you notice you're saying mean things to yourself again, and you keep this up for long enough, your self-esteem will actually get a chance to heal. It's 'just' about habit-changing, and sticking with it.  (And in Natalie's case, resisting the temptation to roam the internet to see what people are saying about you.)"
"GIRL. The person who said you didn’t pass before the surgery is on crack!! Not only were you hot (and still are) you were feminine AF. I want you to do what makes you happy and alleviates any dysphoria but that person was also flat WRONG. I’ve never looked as feminine as you did pre FFS and I’ve got all this estrogen and XX chromosomes and shit. You are stunning! I love you."
"Not sure why this video somewhat depressed me but it did - love u tho queen xoxo"
"How are you such a mood all the time"
"That gymnopédie version in the credits is to die for!"
"The SOPHIE intro though oh my"
"As A cisgender black Man from France ( I really despise this identification but here based on the people who might read this comment it's important for them who is gonna right this more than What is written ^^ ) I feel I absolutely can't relate to the last videos.  I feel like it was much more relatable when you were talking About Democracy, capitalism, racism, or alt-right. Last Very Very good content was the Incels one, maybe the best actually.   But this super girly representation that you are on I dont feel Girls are like this, If we can Ever put all femaleS under A concept ( we can't ) but A Very commodified version of A girl ( Which makes a lot of echo And irony to your critic of capitalism ).   And yes I feel it's Just about trans trans And trans. NOT An all around Channel that is open to all ' identities ' but Just A trans Channel where trans feel at home, And others have to get with it.   I look forward to the growth of this Channel ( sorry If my english is bad I'm french mdr )"
"I really love what you do.  So many complex thoughts and ideas.  Deeply clever and and brilliantly delivered.  Thank you."

"Genuinely not trying to fuck with you or say some smart shit, Both the before and after look like women I've known (cis women in this case). Good thing its not up to me what other people do with their bodies, I'm happy you're happy!"
"<3"
"This was a really great video, I think there is a bit of a beauty revolution happening, where beauty and 'intelligence' meet again. My ideas on beauty have started to become more like the ones you mention at the end because I've been watching Aly Art, who takes more of an artistic approach to beauty."
"I agree that it's tough to tell how pretty you are when people have this idea that calling someone anything under a 9 is insulting. Thanks, patriarchy lmao. I think you hit the nail on the head when you said that beauty is a collective aesthetic, and the rating scale is a measure of those standards, not how desirable/likable/attractive/moral/etc. you are.  In terms of how desirable/likable/attractive you are, yes absolutely, indisputably, you are a 10. You're amazing and I want to be around you all the time. I love staring at your face. But that's not the same thing as how well you fit conventional beauty standards. For that, I agree with your flippant assessment, which is that you're 60-70% conventionally beautiful, with wiggle room depending on personal preference (Ask two cis dudes to rate which Hollywood actresses are the most beautiful. There's wiggle room.).  Since you talk a lot about your personal complexes surrounding beauty, I'm curious why you didn't get more 'conventional' work done since you were going under the knife anyway. Whatever the answer, I commend you for staying authentic, and I also award you 10 morality points (society is made up and the points don't matter)."
"So I know the make up tutorial intro was a spoof, but I am actually deadly curious about what eyeshadow you used in this vid, it’s gorgeous and I want it"
"Plastic surgery (especially silicone) makes trans women more clockable. So if that is your goal... don't do it.  Unless  you want to look like Blaire White... in that case go for it"

"I was about to go to sleep... oh wait contrapoints uploaded nevermind"
"The Raoul Duke of Revlon!"
"I find it hilarious that anti fa find contra points videos convincing. It’s also funny how people think conta points is “de radicalising” young white men."
"Must be nice having a face to match the voice... because I mean, gurl, dat voice... meowr! X3 Considering the amount of vanity that men participate in, (bodybuilding, fear of balding, tailored suits, trimmed facial hair), it honestly seems like beauty obsession cuts both ways. It's just, when men do it, they're 'taking pride in their appearance,' and when women do it, they're 'shallow and vain.' Because double standards. jus my 2c."
"So many of the comments here are so positive and supportive. What the fuck is happening? This is still YouTube right?  Has anyone else noticed that Natalie is the ONLY trans person on YouTube whose comments aren't absolute fucking cancer? What is her secret?   Are the transphobic trolls afraid of commenting because they know her Stans are NOT to be fucked with? Because that's my theory."
"'See? I'm not a bimbo! I'm a poet!' Best. Channel."

"Loved starting this video and hearing a SOPHIE song!"
"I've said it before, and I'll say it again:  please sit on my face mom"
"You really are beautiful. But then, I get it."
"I'm halfway into my phd and i always feel the pressure of not dressing up too much. I don't know why i love makeup. now in my mid 20s, having survived anorexia, i'm finally coming to terms with my face and body. I used to like painting so i assume (and tell curious ppl) that my fascination with makeup and clothes is an extension of that. but whenever i have a doctoral committee meeting i consciously dress down. when i go out i get too many comments like 'ur so different'. But most men appreciate the artistry that goes into it and the effort i put into it (they flatter themselves with the idea that i do it for them specifically) but i do it for me...complicated!"
"Just let us stan you don't worry about it"
"I'm not a fan of yours so please notice my unbias opinion about your looks. The first video i watched from you (the incels one), I immediately knew you were a trans woman. But now, after the medical procedures you remind me of a larger face version of Anna Faris when she doesn't wear bangs... Which is an acceptable feminine look for me. BTW I prefer a woman who looks like you, instead of someone like gigi, she looks so plastic to me. But that's just me, and I'm a grain of sand in a sea of opinions."
"That intro is the most amazing intro I've ever seen and heard. That is just incredible. It's horrifying and intriguing at the same time, so on point, it's scary. Make a full music video, full song. Pleaseeee"
"But she look good. 💁💜"
"i love your honesty about this. i also struggle a lot with the GAP between my woke mind and my messy feelings. i knew that 'my feelings are valid' but most people dont really talk abour wtf that really means. you did. thank you 💛💗"
"Hey, Nat. Some good stuff, but it looks like you are losing inspiration. Will you put on a concert?"
"The bone lady is creepy. I love it. I want to meet her."

"At first i was hopping you will read my coment about how goregeous you look....     ...now i know you read every coment ever done to you at least twice. (L) happy scrolling trow the coment section contrapoints(L)"
"Your surgery worked. Took me a moment to be sure you were you, and not some pretty girl doing a video under your identity. What you do with your body is obviously your decision and nobody else's. So don't let what anybody says override what you feel is right. That said, I do think you look great. There's nothing wrong with being pretty and political! 💜💙💖"
"As always, you have like the most nuanced take on issues. So good. And you looked pretty before and pretty now with a softer face shape."

"20:07   imho, watching the evolution of your face during the 'day time routine',  you looked best/sexiest by just rubbing on the exfoliator + cleansing jell combo."
"So, basically, beauty industry is like low-key religion. It creates unachievable standards impossible to uphold. Then it constructs holy icons and associates these artificial images with being beautiful and happy, condemns those less lucky in the genetic lottery as sinners and shows them 'the only path to redemption.' Profit. And the reason why it works is the age-old psychological problem of facing the inevitable: transience of youth and mortality."
"Hi, grad school Becky here. I can't talk for all of us, but personally, I don't wear make-up on a regular basis and it's not supposed to be a 'not like other girls weird flex'. I just noticed that when I do, I get used to it and then feel less comfortable without make-up. I wanna feel beautiful too, but make-up has only been a vicious cycle for me, making me feel less pretty and more inadequate in the long run. So I just forced myself to get used to my diseased lookin buttnaked face and now I'm hella comfortable with it. Most of the time. Kinda.  Or maybe it's because I'm half lesbian and thus medium chillin', who knows."
"I love this show. This episode was fantastic. So many good points were made and so much Truth was laid to bare but still, it was also very funny and I appreciated that humorous touch. Also, Natalie, you have so much style and I am so very happy for you that you were able to afford surgery and had a good experience. Congratulations darling you look like several tens of thousands of dollars and years of education and skill. What I mean to say is that your beauty has deep worth in a capitalist society and it really shows.  - AKA you look Hawt. Not that my opinion matters. Also, I love your style and personal aesthetic and while at first, I questioned the direction of the channel because for me it seemed to focus more on entertainment than education and I prefer your wisdom and intelligence to whimsey - Damn girl you still got it and the entertainment is just extra fries. Very nice."
"I so resonate with that part about critiquing, but  still wanting to achieve beauty standards. I can critique ideals of masculine pulchritude till the cows come home, but I still find myself wanting to chug gallons of whey and throw around massive iron weights. And maybe get some hair plugs too... Ugh"

"as a gay guy, i know little of female customs and rituals. Seeing a woman without makeup is always a shock (especially when >50 of their eyebrows are makeup and you never noticed) but I must say, you look lovely with or without makeup. Your videos help me get an idea of how my wife feels about being transgender, and for that, thank you."
"I have the same problem with hair length. I grew up in the sticks and as an artistic, book-loving, TTRPG-playing gay, having my hair short gives me life. But then I panic. Do I look like one of my brothers? Should I have spent an hour longer in the chair so that the back of my head could look more 'feminine' than the clippers can accomplish? Do my cowlicks make my hair look dumb? Then I kinda forget about it until it grows out enough that the back begins to look like a mullet which brings up all kinds of emotions and I get the urge to buzz my entire head."
"The Apocalypse has retail employee uniform aesthetics. Much easier to think about Kandinsky sequins."
"Okay, I just started watching the video and that intro was FIRE!"
"i agree with you 1000% on 'style' over 'beauty' and i hope you really take that insight to heart. imo you don't need any justification or shame about manifesting your aesthetic; you, and your life, are a fucking work of art to shape into whatever expressive form resonates with your desires and beliefs. even 'superficial' aesthetics can be surprisingly full of meaning and depth to the right pair of eyes. don't underestimate the insane, spiritual importance of turning your life and self into an unbounded work of art."

"I know you'll never believe this hyperbole, but you really are the best. Like of all people, places, and things. Like ever."
"I think there's a whole interesting conversation about lesbians (but namely the more masculine ones) rejecting the idea of lots of beauty standards  Because there's often this IMMENSE feeling of a relief when a lesbian realizes they don't have to marry a man, and that can come with 'oh hey hell yeah actually fuck shaving i dont care anymore' And one of the more shallow reads on this is 'oh, rejecting heterosexual beauty standards because you're not available to men'  But in my experience this may align more with the kind of self-understanding that comes with that revalation that you don't have to put on as much of a show  because lots of other lesbians are also taking that breath of fresh air and know the kind of vulnerability that it takes to get there This is not all across the board of course, I'm more aesthetically in the 'ruffled scientist in a cartoon' nb-masculine camp myself with my round glasses and stick-up hair Lipstick lesbians are out there though and they're honestly supporting the backbone of our society I had a girlfriend who looked like a sanrio pixie with a kpop haircut every day and that kind of thing heals your soul tbh (but also she wore makeup for herself, and it added that other interesting dimension of being around when she wasn't so polished) But styles more on the masculine end definitely exist and are fascinatingly varied there are definitely lesbians who will put A LOT of energy into being beautiful in nontraditional ways. Janelle Monae comes to mind in terms of manicured gender nonconformity, or the girl from My Drunk Kitchen who walks the line of relaxed fuckboy aesthetic I forgot where i was going with this uhhh it's 2am sorry thanks for reading  Anyways a very interesting point though! I hadn't considered a lot of this, and congrats on getting your surgery!! I've only had lung ones and they suck but i can't IMAGINE the kind of pain face ones involve, thats some really really admirable determination and commitment!!!"
"'obsessing about looks' isn't at all the same as 'caring about looks'! contra, that's just wrong. some obsess, some just care. obviously the society we live in wants all of us to obsess, since that sells a hell of a lot more stuff. this clip could've been a lot more interesting, despite your honesty and irony.  ps. in my (cisfemale) eyes, you are lovely."

I definitely get treated like less of a shallow idiot when I wear jeans and T-shirt’s than when I wear makeup and dresses. It’s stupid, but true. I’ve just cared less and less about what people think. You gotta do what makes you happy!"
"Thank you for your videos. I've been watching you for a while and I know it's not saying much but I think you're beautiful."
"Our Dark Mother returns!"
"fuck you, you gave me tingles while I was already listening to other asmr in the background >:("
"She may joke about being Van Gogh But I truly believe these videos will be watched a hundred years from now. while the 'great art' of today will be only a footnote."
"Hey gorgeous!"
"You look different. Is it the lighting?"
"Love this video and nope, us lesbians care about our looks a lot too"
"Kalamu ddin ansari"

"okay but can we get a full fanmade m/v for Faceshopping because you're KILLIN it!!! UR FUCKING EVERYTHANG!!!"
"17:17 - one moment of unguarded infectious grinning."
"That 'Faceshopping' song is fucking disgusting.  I love it, thanks for sharing it."
"You look so much look a young Winona Ryder. I don't know if this is something you have heard a lot because this is the first video I have seen of yours. I'm definitely a fan and just subbed! (That's a compliment btw. She was beautiful)"

"Natalie, I'm a liberally educated post-woke intellectual like you. I've been reading a mediocre book recommended by a woman who I'm romantically interested in for reasons other than her literary taste, and I've been dishonestly flattering her about the book rec. Why do I flatter her, lie that I'm enjoying the book when I could just as easily make it a project to destroy and reconstruct her literary taste? Flattery is a way to express attraction and admiration by ensuring that the flattered's necessary failure within a refined critical apparatus doesn't exclude them from attraction and admiration. I think about your fans telling you that you're flawless, so patently false that it has to be flattery. Your reaction reminds me of a George Lazenby blog post about liberal education    'Do you care about the whirl of experience more than you care about the comfort and leisure that would make that sort of life a pleasure? Because if you do liberal arts right, you’ll become a roulette ball that never settles. For the rest of your life no identity will seduce, no doctrine will persuade, and no accomplishment will reward. You will not win because the momentum of intellectual greed bends everything into a circuit.  If Faust and Paradise Lost don’t read as cautionary tales to you; if you’re okay with seeming like a loser to everyone around you and—inwardly—even to your deepest self, then do it.'   It must needs be remarked that you should just read Plato again and live for death."
"I have a strange relationship with performative femininity. My mother was THRILLED to have a daughter but ended up with a genderqueer kid who did not give a flying fuck about makeup and dresses. She tried to encourage me into makeup and the like and I just hated it, still hate it. I hate how it feels on my skin, I hate that I can't touch my face out of fear of smudging everything into ruin. I'd say I'm usually 60% masculine and 40% feminine but if I try to push more femininity I feel... fake... artificial... I hate it. To me, it's putting on a costume and pretending to be something I'm not.   I've been struggling to come to term with my 'transness', I don't consider myself a woman, or a man, I just don't want to engage in the social norms of either. Yeah, I wear a bra, because I have big tits. Yeah, I tend to wear clothes from the woman's section but that's because I have giant child bearing hips and a snatched waist, I'd have to tailor anything coming out of the men's section to fit big boobs and hips. I'm also autistic and can't handle harsh fabrics and men's clothes are often made out of sandpaper and cardboard.   Even with all that I still feel the pressures of beauty and adhering to a standard. People view me as a woman so they expect me to do traditionally feminine things. I've always gotten weird looks how I present myself. It would be easier on me if I wasn't like this but... then I wouldn't be me I'd be someone else.   I do respect the HECK out of anyone who can put on makeup. It's practically an esoteric ritual I can't understand so y'all are doing magic."
"I’m of the opinion of do what makes you feel better with yourself. I’m almost 40, and I still want to have FFS but here in Mexico there are only a couple surgeons that practice it and it’s uber expensive; same with GCS (previously SRS). you’re fantastic any way I look it!"
"Looking great. And I mean that, it's not empty flattery or anything like that. :) Also, do camo pants and band t-shirts count as a style?... :P"
"I mean... If you can afford plastic surgery, you can definitely afford therapy. Seems like a better thing to do for yourself in the long run."
"I would like to say... your face surgery is absolutely poppin. It looks amazing and you look so gorgeous. And makeup is on point. Seriously, I think your face looks so pretty and so cute in this video! The hair look with your hair pushed back behind your shoulders with one strand to the side (like in 25:30) is such a nice look too.. Style is good. Honestly, even though a lot of people conform to beauty standards it’s pretty rare for us to judge other people based on those standards.. we only seem to judge ourselves Idk I’m pretty drunk 🤷🏼‍♂️"
"I needed this"
"I've watched the vid a handful of times.....and I still physically shudder every time it gets to: 'was then CHISELED away, removed,  reshaped, and then re-affixed.....'"
"Don't skip your sunscreen doll. Add tretinoin for anti aging :)"
"Amazing video. Cancelling 'beauty' by becoming beautiful on your own terms. Exceptionally gorgeous and fabulous."
"You’re valid; your decision to get ffs is valid. As cis allies, we must understand that the decision to get such a procedure is incredibly personal and that it’s imperative to support whatever decision trans folks make in regards to it."
"My... You are so beautiful!!!"
"You look beautiful as always"
"I am in office and I am laughing out loud at her skincare routine. Natalie girl, you rock! XD XD XD"
"Important q: is that your brain scan?"
"I appreciate this amazing makeup tutorial."
"She looks soo good gggff"
"I don't make comments like this often, but hearing you talk about the torrent of negativity you get and knowing how awful that can be, I thought I should voice my opinion too.   You look very nice! I was surprised, I didn't realize plastic surgery could look so normal. Your face really does look more female now. I'm not going to lie to you and say you look like a transcended beauty goddess come to shower us all in graceful femininity, but you do look pretty. If I saw you on the street, I'd automatically assume you're female."
"Seriously, get some P50 and Good Genes! And a good Vitamin C serum!! And follow Caroline Hirons for more skincare!"
"You actually gave me tingles from the ASMR part"
"The music was high quality."
"Ok Seriously what does feeling pretty means.🤔 Please elaborate people 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🙄😶"
"1:22 I thought you were about to do the THX sound"
"Natalie! Get some P50!! You'll love it."
"I’m a lesbian but I still hate myself."
"I'm not a bimbo, I'm a POET. lmao using that one"
"I love lesbians"
"I felt that body hair comment. I, too, am on my way to be a cisgender boiled egg"
"Not to downplay the rest of the vid but that intro went h a r d Also ilysm you strong ass comrade(tte)"
"I wonder what Freud would say about the fact that I’d fuck the shit out of bandage Nat with the freaky music in the background"

"You can make change through the way you spend your money. Like makeup? Buy from Black female owned companies.  Need effective skin care products, look for independent companies that use few ingredients so you only pay for what you need. Plus, you can watch all the beauty influencers you want, and call it “research.” Win-win."
"I like how every time Natalie pronounces a foreign name with a guttural fricative—like Baccchhhhh or Van Goggghhh—the music stops, the camera zooms in, and for just a brief moment in time we get to appreciate the sophistication of European phlegm."
"this is so freakin relatable and thank you"
"*gracile*"
"Choke me mommy  But all jokes aside, yet another thought provoking video! I love your content so much! So cerebral and yet not taking itself too seriously in a perfect ratio! You're the best and I want to date you in a parasocial way 😉"
"*Van Gohchhhhhhh*"
"You are beautiful"
"Ngl natalie you look like blake lively in this video  And yes queen you are beautiful"
"I love this outfit"
"These videos always remind me about how life is stupid and garbage and that we use sequins to try to justify our own existence."
"Good song"
"You wanted to be conventionally beautiful nothing wrong with that."
"SOPHIE in a ContraPoints video I NEEDED"
"I love your videos. I wish I was smart enough to say something witty to make you feel better when you are having a hard time. I think you are gorgeous, surgery or not ive been attracted to you since the beginning.  I really , really hope that you find some kind of balance, that you can look at yourself in the mirror and see you the way that I, and many others, see you. Take care."
"It does look natural. It's how you feel, if it makes you happy."
"It's funny you talk about women in academia being 'Anti-beauty'. That's always been my thought as well, but my girlfriend and her best friend (both women in academia) have both said the opposite: they feel judged by their women peers when they *don't* put in effort to look nice. Whether that's just an isolated case (they work in different but culturally similar institutions) or not I really can't say, as my several millimeters of skull give me immunity."
"You are Beautiful with a capital B, my dear."
"I thought you were doing great being honest about what you actually care about until 26:16 and the whole bit about changing desires. As though YOU know, or anyone else knows, what desires it would be good for us to have--or would know how to produce them if you did. It's unbelievably arrogant and false. Forget the idea that desires are 'socially constructed,' since no one understands the mechanism that's involved. Our desires are what they are: we should just try to distinguish the enduring from the ephemeral and square ourselves as much as possible to what we cannot hope to change intentionally or within the relevant time frame. Yes, some people will end up feeling bad about themselves, but at least they won't have faked a solution to something that genuinely bothers them."
"Personally I find beauty to be a individual uniqueness. This is coming from a bisexual guy who finds  masculine/feminine men/women trans both MTF & FTM to be attractive. I guess if someone looks generally healthy and i dont mean by body shape but taking the time to look after themselves and can express their individuality through there choice of style like conversational or punky or hippy or anything as long as it's a reflection of who they are inside. Then i would think their beautiful. That's how I see it anyway."
"the makeup tutorial is unclear and now there is lipstick all over my eyes!"
"i missed you and your frank, open talks about dysphoria :D"
"I have no constructive commentary other than your makeup looks amazing."
"congrats"
"How about beauty giving us power? how the masses bow to the beautiful?   I am sorry, that you didn't feel like that after your operation, hope you feel better soon.   I solved the issue, as I once realised what beauty means and what it means in the eyes of other people. how they see/value/etc. you. I decided that I didn't want that and stopped going for that.   Yes, I have my own style and I am happy.   I am even more happy since I realized my selfworth isn't determined how beautiful I am. its a bit like the emperors new clothes. But I also agree that you need to take careof yourselves, as it shows how mcuh you got your life together.   Hope you feel better soon :)"
"Did you just deliberately film yourself staring into a mirror until it all inevitably became to much and you broke down crying?   Because that...I didn't think their were other people who felt that way.   But also, WHY! I wouldn't look in a mirror for more than the amount of time it takes to shave and put on some foundation and concealer. No footage would be worth that."
"Can we talk about how this is the best contrapoints video? Here's why: 1)  Obviously I'm sure she curated herself, but we got to hear from Natalie herself, instead of just through characters 2) We got to see her replay a lot of old characters and reference a lot of older videos post-FFS, which I hope was as empowering as it looks 3) That production though, like damn 4) Detective Pikachu."
"Well, uhm thank you for being so sincere with your thoughts. Sincerely me."
"Natalie, Jeffree Star is a fucking racist. You may not know this but he called Jackie Aina a gorilla last year. I’m disappointed you gave him the smallest of shoutouts.  I’m glad you’re feeling yourself though, that biological ‘sequins dress’ is incredible."
"It's a real shame that you care so much about being beautiful ..."
"no shade but is this like the contrapoints recap episode, there's so many references to your other vids (and i love it)"
"that opening was SO METAL im heart eyes"
"15:41 I laughed so hard I had to pause to collect myself  F."
"Another amazing fucking thought provoking video honestly I watch these every night and they always get me into an incredibly positive but critiquing mood about how to make my life and those around me better so thank you for that sincerely"
"woah that got scary so fast"
"I think the reason I don't care much about my appearance isn't because I'm less shallow than anyone else, I'm just busy doing other things. Also, as you mentioned, I'm studying engineering, a heavily male-dominated field, so I don't feel much pressure to look feminine. Wearing a lot of makeup would make me stand out more as one of three women in a class of 25 men. Also I just never learned to do makeup and now I'm too nervous/lazy to ever do it. I've been putting most of my effort into creating the most bisexual outfits possible."
"you were always beautiful (not to be one of those people, i just genuinely always thought you were) and you are now too. I love you and your humour so much, i could watch your videos all day"
"Liking this video, even though it breaks my heart that Natalie can’t see herself the way i see her 💜 my parasocial relationship with her just keeps getting more intimate with every videoooooo!"
"Listen, you don't need style or beauty to find meaning in this world. You need a big fucking sword and Meshuggah on repeat in your head. Just let the darkness wash over you as you succumb to your demons and become the evil you sought to destroy. Only then can you find inner peace. Namaste."
"I didn't think this video would be very interesting so I avoided watching it for a few days. But once again ContraPoints has given me a lot to think about and given me a different perspective on things. ContraPoints can turn any topic into something deep and thought provoking. She could literally do a video about a stick she found in her driveway and still make it interesting. Also, she looks absolutely beautiful."
"8:13 I find that interesting since I also feel more masculine when I'm lookin' ugly, bUT I'm a trans mAN. And I think that feeds more into your point, since guys dont feel societal pressure to be attractive at the same level that women do. I can get away with it whilst alleviating dysphoria because of that social norm"
"I’m so proud of your j o u r n e y, but I’m also happy that incels have a pathway through that measly few millimeter of bone."
"You're giving me 90s young Celine Dion vibes. But more importantly you're a unique, smart and funny individual."
"it's so strange to know its ok to be ugly and still not feel ok with being ugly"
"we use the same missha essence :D"
"Looking fabulously feminine. Keep feeling better."
"um just curious what is with all ASMR and hypno stuff?"
"Watching this 4 days post-op from my rhinoplasty haha, how ironic! Ain't nothing wrong with wanting to be beautiful <3"
"There is something missing here. I can’t quite figure it out though. Desiring to be beautiful comes from a need for acceptance. Women tend to be more critically judged on appearance. It’s understandable how you feel. I think it is important to do more introspection and discover the root of your emotions. Why is it important for someone to feel beautiful? How did that word become so emotionally loaded? I’m sure you’re beautiful even in a burlap sack. And I’m sure that’s coming from both envy and attraction."
"The beginning reminded me of a video I saw a long time ago. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbSZC09A29E"
"You've looked a queen before, but now  now you look like a GODDESS"
"You are beautiful. And it’s not just because of your skin wrapper. It’s because of your soul. 🧡"
"Nah, the reason we throw that over the top lust at you is because we love you no matter what, and want to back-justify our love against however you look today. People don't want to been seen lusting after someone who doesn't look utterly hot; we say you always look like a goddess  because we want your look to match our desire, even when it doesn't.   If you're always attractive, we're always clear to lust after you.  /Drunk cynicism"
"NATALIE MAKE ASMR VIDEOS PLS"
"x,D NOoo the sunscreen was the most important one!"
"Darling, you're looking at the reason for our societal preoccupation with beauty all wrong. Beauty is a symptom, as is ugliness, as is aging. We're all capable and able to be beautiful; and the reason why we're obsessed with certain beauty standards is because they are indications of health. By understanding the issues we have with our bodies as symptoms of our internal health; then we're all capable of attaining perfect health; and through this: longevity.  I'm ranting, but here are some examples: Upper arm fat is a disturbance in our endocrine system (the one that uses adipose as a means of inter-glandular communication and storage) caused by a thyroidal imbalance: eat some iodine (best sources being seaweed like kombu, wakame, and dulse).  Dry skin can be caused by a vitamin A deficiency.  a lack of/ or depletion of ones' magnesium (and some other minerals) shows up in our dental-health.   Seriously, try googling whatever symptom you dislike with 'hormonal cause' or 'vitamin deficiency'; and you'll find a rationalized, un-co-modified answer to your completely subliminally valid insecurity.       Sometimes I think the free market is just confused, not evil. Anyway, you should read up on some estrogen/ progesterone boosting foods (like coffee and parsley). Oh, and collarbones are, like, one of the hottest body-parts; don't even."
"My stomach was in my throat. After seeing plastic surgery being performed it grosses me out big to thing about"
"you can never truly be cisgender female some can pull it off but you cant."
"This dude sounds like a fag"
"Oh god don't skip the sunblock. It's probably the only thing on that desk that actually does something"
"The sunscreen probably does the most to protect your skin. UV rays make your skin age. Ever see the pictures of truck drivers with the left half of their face more wrinkly and leathery than the other half? UV rays. 'S also why we can't live on the moon."
"Dramatically saying story time three times *REALLY* makes me feel that story time is coming up. Edit: This shit was deep. I've been following you for a while, but honestly, due to a disappointingly lacking attention span, I've rarely finished any of your content. This was the first video that I watched all the way through, and I have to say that I'm deeply impressed. Despite your flair for the frivolously dramatic and your dry but immensely effective humor, I felt the intensity of your feelings. I bet you cry sometimes because of the things you're going through. Incredibly hard. But after you're done, know that you're a glint of positivity in this ocean of temporary entertainment. Some things will fail to stand the test of time. You're not one of them."
"Fuck, this video hits waaaay too close to home lol"
"Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides was my AOTY 2k18 and when you used it in the intro my entire brain was snatched."
"Please make a pallet. We love you."
"This is my new favorite video of your's, so raw and real; yet, it made me smile and laugh at points.  As a non-binary for whom wearing make-up causes dysphoria I wholeheartedly applaud your dedication. It's really quite inspiring to see the effort you go to. I may not personally understand it, but I recognise the empowerment you can get from it.  The bluntness and honesty you put into your work is one of the most appealing things for me and so let me say in pure bluntness and honesty you look great. I thought you looked particularly fem when the vid started and couldn't quite figure out why. Imo you more than pass, your dedication to the art of fem aesthetics pushes that ever higher.  You're an inspiration academically and visually. A part of me wishes I'd had half the love for the arts of face and hair you do, would have saved me a lot of abuse, but that said I do honestly admire you and all that you've done to find and live your truth.  Thank you for this and so many of your other videos, they always help me gain perspective, and are more deeply memorable than I really have the nuance to describe."
"I watch your video and, inmediately, share to my waifu. is increidible how the humans pursue the ideal of beauty and how this pursue hurt us"
"Women are wired to pay attention to their looks ion order to attract men. Pretending that men and women are islands that evolved these expressions for no reason is silly.    Yeah, women feel good when they think they are more likely to be valued by men. Who'd a thunk it?"
"Glad you’re back."
"I think about the relationship between beauty and gender disphoria a lot because I identify as agender and often I can't tell if my dysphoria is gender related, beauty standard related or both."
"lesbians are INDEED straight chillin ....in that old navy men’s section swag  😂"
"I think you're gorgeous 😘"
"So I'm the daughter of two engineers, and while my mom's lack of makeup may have been an affectation of trying to be taken seriously in a male-dominated field, my own complete lack of understanding of or concern for (facial) beauty is something I grew up with. It's like being raised speaking only Klingon: your parents are going to a lot of effort to keep up something that is unnatural for them; everyone else thinks you're weird, or even going out of your way to seem smart; and you're just speaking Klingon fluently and have to slowly teach yourself English as a second language to figure out how to communicate with other people."
"Style is classist, you capitalist sell-out.   *tips beret*"
"CONTRA IS HOT. FUCK."
"Okay I have to know. Was that spontaneous ASMR?"
"mm i have so many issues with dysphoria combining with eating disorder combining with instagram angst, from my own weird afab androgynous fag perspective. it helps + feels validating to hear it from another person. there were also parts that were very challenging to hear but i think i needed that. thanks for making these videos"
"5' 2'? CUCKED"
"Looking SHARP!"
"❤"
"You can't seriously be suggesting that style is more accessible than beauty. Fashion is one of the most elitist and exclusionary institutions I can think of. I guess you can get lucky and have a cheap sense of style that works for you, but you'll always be judged as inferior to people who can afford nicer clothes."
"That dark Gymnopedie at the end was amazing. Zoe Blade is amazing."
"It is complicated. But thanks for tackling it and sharing your vulnerabilities with us. I've wrestled my own issues with my appearance for years, and just when I think I have them pinned down, along comes some other bullshit for me to obsess about. Serums, eye bags, impending 40-hood. Does it ever end?   I'm just another internet rando, but I think you have a metric asston of style and you're gorgeous. I hope you can someday see the beauty that we do."
"Haha, FFS."
"Wrong to relate so hard to this as a cis woman? This video hits so much profundity, it hurts. Wow."
"They ate biological sequins 😂"
"OH YES THE SOPHIE SONG OPENING IT"
"You definitely look like yourself."
"Gay or gamer"
"'Post-ironic, feminine beauty.' Sing it, sister. Gorgeous brains and gorgeous faces: forces with which to be reckoned!"
"Finally a Natalie video where I have at least a fraction of the knowledge to contribute.  As a lifelong aesthete and purveyor of glamour, I feel it's my duty to invite you to our club. Do we feel guilty for the negative effects the fashion and beauty industry wreak on the world! Absolutely! I've been at this for 20+ years now so as an experienced superficial monstrosity, I recommend my model of slightly mindful but still deeply vain consumerism. I'm trying to buy more makeup from black owned beauty brands so I can at least enrich black women, since they're our real leaders in this social justice thing. With clothing and accessories, I'm attempting to buy from small independent Etsy sellers or thrifting, so I don't contribute to the fast fashion food chain. Etc etc. Can reccomend, definitely alleviates much of the guilt.   Frankly I would say if you're subscribing to arbitrary beauty culture such as wanting to be hairless and cellulite free, then you're just like your cisters. That's what we do, because we want to serve fashion and glamour to the girls and that's what our media glamorizes for us. Most cis girls of today are trying to fit an hourglass mold, in the oughts when all fashionable clothing was midriff baring, we were obsessed with flat stomachs. In the 90's we wanted heroin chic, in the 80's we wanted skinny athletic Australian with big titties etc etc. Welcome, come enjoy hopeless consumption culture with the rest of us!"
"Man, that's heavy right off the bat."
"Fabulous points (no pun intended)--style has this amazing ability to render traditional physical beauty meaningless if you want it to. I think you may find it useful to take a look Violette_fr, a French makeup artist and upper-level beauty industry employee who dedicates her career to using style and aesthetic choices to help people appreciate and embrace their societal 'weirdness' as something rare and beautiful and tailored to them :)"
"You mentioned my country!!! I'm glad you like Bulgarian rose oil <3"

"'I want to attract nonbinary people too, of course, but right now you're kind of getting in the way of me crudely stereotyping people based on gender sooooo HOW DARE YOU,' god I'm nonbinary and I can't tell you how many times I have been mildly inconvenienced by my own existence when trying to make a point about how things work in a binarist cisheteronormative society, seriously, a mood"

"ok what highlighter is that though"
"Ok, I am going to tell the truth, Contra. You didn't pass amazingly before the surgery, but you were hot as a woman, it kinda sounds like it makes no sense, but it does, I'm a lesbo and I know when girls are hot. Now, your face passes 100% and by the way, looks cute af, even though it looks a little swollen. That's the truth"
"I used to hate my chubby body, until I watch porn that have male models that looks like me, and then i became okay with my body cuz I tricked myself into thinking that there are a niche market for chubby darkskinned asians. Try it it works"
"I've been thinking about this since last night and I do want to say a couple things. The depression stuff really comes through, I think less in the couple of times Natalie mentions it outright but in tone overall and especially the 'I don't want to be contrapoints anymore but I guess I have to' bit. Uh hey, Contra, hang in there. I really want this to be the depression talking - it does sound like the sort of thing depression says - but I also hope if you're feeling boxed in that you can find some freedom. It's hard with capitalism and all.  And also like. I want to say re: the actual topic of discussion that I think maybe it's just not helpful to talk about whether individual trans women should have ffs or do anything in particular to meet societal standards of feminine beauty but like, the responsibility has to be instead about system change. I know this is kind of just trite leftist one size fits all talking point stuff but I mean it. Like to me the argument that ffs is medically necessary leaves a lot of room to leave out the validity of other people's transition if they don't do it for whatever reason but I think it's also bad to attack someone (Natalie) for trying to feel good about themselves in a hostile world and like solidarity to make the world less hostile seems  like the only way to reconcile that yno?"
"She always puts in THE BEST surprise ASMR in her videos 😂  Also, anyone else feel like she would love the movie Neon Demon?"

"Let’s get the weird thing out. Not wearing makeup may appear to be more visually contrasting on the face, because of dark circles around the eyes and stuff. However, makeup actually makes the face more contrasting, depending on how you do it. This then brings in the point where studies have shown that higher contrast makes the same face more feminine and vice versa. However, due to “natural” makeup there seem to be more of a gradient where the masculine is off center and gradients to feminine both ways. This brings up non facial points. For example, I as a nonbinary trans person, who has a hard time explaining the use of she/her without being a woman and it not generalizing to miss, madam, or the similar, find that my broad shoulders make me look alien in a dress. This is mainly due to that style of clothing not being designed to accommodate my body type. One massive way society could change would be for clothing to match by body type and style preferences."
"When I was in my phd program (which I also left), I was encouraged to quit wearing as much makeup as I did. I tried- I cut down on wearing all my favorite colors to try to look “serious,” but ultimately just felt entirely unlike myself. It always makes me feel better to hear other people noticed the same thing too.  As always: thank you so much for such an incredible video 💚"

"I just wanted to say that when I started watching you Natalie (about 6 months ago) I completely thought you were a cis woman. I’m not playing- I didn’t clock you at all. It took me a confused moment of going through your old videos to realize- and I still had a hard time seeing it. Now, I may be an absolutely gender-clueless pansexual mess- but believe me when I say you really are, and have been, a very beautiful woman to me. I also find your voice sweet and sassy- since you often are critical of that as well.   I know none of this can make you feel better- but I just wanted to say it. You are and you have been, really gorgeous.   Also, those sequins. Damn."
"Why not instead just become Theravada monks? You already know that your clinging to beauty is just a protection of your ego. You understand that this clinging causes you suffering and that only you have the ability to stop clinging to it."
"Yup. The somewhat universal female experience is trying to find that line between 'well groomed' and 'vain.' Do I like my leg hair today or does it make my legs look short and chubby?  I hope you'll be able to reach a point where you like your looks Natalie, because you are pretty."
"P.S. Looking for fullfillment in the shallowest places, denies the value of your struggle. Putting that magnificent mind at the mercy of your amygdala is a waste of the material.  Being happy in one's life will always be more appealing and valuable than being happy about one's life (for you and the people who see you).  Ego is a cheat and a liar."
"Lookin good, thanks for the video and all you do."
"Girl, it's YOUR face. YOUR body. You don't have to justify anything, I think you were already beautiful before the surgery but I'm happy you had the dough to pay for it and that you're happier now. Also... honestly? I think you only get off the crazy beauty train when you're really so fucked up that the thought of bothering with what you look like seems ludicrous.    I'm in that stage myself, I've been chronically ill and in ridiculous pain for so long I've just resigned myself to the fact that I'm not gonna be beautiful ever again, becoming blind and having to worry about money to pay for surgery to freaking be able to see anything is just about all I can take, and if anyone criticizes my appearance they'd better be ready for a fucking earful, too.    So as long as it makes you feel good, do whatever you want, girl. Gods know life is too fucking short for regrets."
"I find the discussion on makeup very interesting because I had experienced very different growing up as a cis woman. I remember in middle school the day my mom took me to  Sephora and a lady there showed me how to put on makeup for every day and make up for special occasions. From that day on, I felt as if my face without make-up was unpresentable. I could not go outside without makeup. It was a necessity. By senior year of high school, I realized I had deeply internalized these feelings. I felt ugly without makeup. Whenever I went outside without makeup, I was deeply self-conscious. I had never really struggled with self-image like that before. For the first time, I really thought I was ugly. So I decided in college I wouldn't wear make-up. At first, I was super self-conscious, but eventually, I thought it insane to wear makeup everyday. I want to add that I never really liked makeup. I found putting it on to be a chore more than anything else. So I didn't wear makeup. I am going into my junior year of college, and I can happily say I find myself beautiful again without wearing makeup.  Now, I only wear makeup when I want to and not for some sense of necessity. I also don't consider makeup to be covering up my flaws but just enhancing my natural beauty.  This turned longer then I wanted it to, but I just think about if I would have a different understanding of makeup if I started wearing it when I was older and not eleven. Also, how vastly different ever individuals experiences with makeup. It was fascinating hearing Natalie talk about this and her feelings about it."
"I kinda feel the self affirming beauty rituals as a fat guy. I'll try super hard to find the right clothes that are loose enough to hide my gut and hips but don't look baggy and slovenly, and finding jeans that fit my waist but won't end up under the heels at the end of my kinda short legs because Levi Strauss decided that having a waist over 34 inches must mean you're a giant. Then I'll spend a good amount of time sculpting my beard to the jawline because, again, can't lool like a lazy slob because being stylishly disheveled isn't an option for fat guys, but not having a beard emphasizes your double chin. I seek that rush of 'yeah, I look good' and love comments about my hair or clothes but have no idea what good looks like for me. I know you focused on your experiences as a tall trans woman (I wish it was possible to offer you my tiny limbs) but thank you for showing me I'm not the only one who does this kind of thing."
"1:20      Me reading the first question during a Chemistry Exam"
"Loved the Fear&Loathing reference."
"feeling ugly regardless of how you look is the fishiest thing of all. congratulations, nat, you're a girl."
"Damn, Sophie. Continuing the trend of excellent music taste! Thanks for the new vid :) amazing and sharply insightful as always."
"You look so cute!"
"I'm not a big fan, I'm more here to see your points. I'll be honest, you didn't really pass before, you were attractive then but yeah. You look more feminine now which I will be honest, makes you look great. You pass and it's definitely made you look stunning. I showed a picture of you to my guy friend and he said you were hot. (He wouldn't be a fan. He's very right leaning.)"
"Holy fuck I need that sequin ASMR bit on repeat for like an hour plz."
"You’re a sad thing, contra. A sad thing."
"For someone like me; a ciswomen that suffers from body dysmorphic disorder this video is very helpful and comforting somehow. Thank you <3"
"the feeling of SOPHIE opening a contrapoints video is beautiful! period!"
"I have HW to do this fucking cruel!"
"Less shots with the dramatic lighting in this video...I suppose bc she got the surgery done. It looks nice"
"As I boy who grew up with no athletic abilities, yes I can appreciate your starfish nights as I gazed up at the same starfishes growing up.  As a gay man, yes, I understand the ravishes of time, and how the oil of the paintings about which I critiqued, hold up better than my own skin.  Having completed the second half of my doctorate in mimetic research both occidental and oriental… Well, I read a lot of German and English literature, continental philosophy, and psychoanalysis… well, just those that came up on the syllabi, the most memorable/traumatic being Rilke, Spenser, Milton, Kant, Scarry, Marx, Jameson, Marcuse, Freud, Jung, Lacan, Zizek.  The constant tension between die ewige Ewigkeit and truth and justice and reform and beauty and the.. well, The.  It was a way to open avenues of understanding myself *AS A GAY MAN* I couldn’t comprehend until years later.  The tension still remains between what is aesthetic and beautiful, what is aesthetic as emotional response, and what is beautiful for me… as a Ding an mich selbst. And I am a thing both to others and myself when I, like you, look into the mirror.  What is this thing?  (Fun note in Early Modern English the relative pronouns “who” and “what” were interchangeable).  I’d love to think that, because I am an intellectual, I am attractive, and to some sapiosexuals I am, but my analogous Gigi is the man with the huge Tom of Finland tattoo on his back on all fours at the Folsum Street Fair sucking dick at his master’s command.  That speaks to a sexual aesthetic, which is always at tension to my cerebral notions of what is and must be accomplished for beauty to exist.  As a cis-gendered gay man the beauty of the well-built, hairless, aryan, sex god has ebbed to some extent, no doubt because the people who came of age in the 90’s watching “Bel-Ami Boys,” are no longer boys themselves.  I noticed on Pornhub a category for “men in their thirties,” not daddies, but regular men, or porn stars, who of another generation would have been deemed passed their prime, who create content for those who grew up with them.  I think it’s because there is some recognition within the gay porn community, to recognize that: 1.) their actors are growing older, 2.) the fans of those actors are also growing older, 3.) those who watched those actors want to know they are still virile and/or sexually desirable, and 4.) and audience now exist where middle-aged men will pay (just joking) watch men of their own age…the porn they grew up with now grown up itself.  This aesthetic is on foregrounded in capitalism, exploitation (the cornerstone of capitalism, I don’t need to tell you); nevertheless it creates new categories for the left to critique.  But as a gay man in his late-late thirties, it gives me some reassurance that age and faggotry need not be mutually exclusive. And that is what Christopher Marlowe said before he was stabbed to death… by a cock in his eye."
"Plz forgive yourself for wanting to be beautiful."
"Contrapoints should take the black pill"
"Is is presumptuous on my part to say that, I came for the beautiful face, and stayed for the lesson? Viva, art."
"THANK YOU MY GOD FOR THAT SOPHIE IN THE BEGINNING YOURE LITERALLY AN ANGEL GODDESS QUEEN LEGEND FUCKING INCREDIBLE BITCH WOW"
"i'm waiting on the debut of your asmr channel"
"This video has no damn business being so monumentally relatable to a male teenager"
"very interesting commentary. love that you used Sophie's song to open up! quite appropriate."
"Production value and topic just keeps going up, I love Also, he’ll yeah I wanna be beautiful. And no one should be afraid to know and say that. Also I’m a lab tech, and yeah, I don’t see much in terms of pretty makeup or nails on my fellow women, and I’m guilty of this as well. But I’ve been fighting that, wearing cute things to the lab (don’t worry I prioritize my safety above cute), wearing pretty nail polish, and grooming eyebrows and hair more often. I do it because I like it, and because I enjoy the routines and confidence. Granted all my cute stuff is comfy, but comfy doesn’t need to be ratty tennis shoes, sweatpants, and sweatshirts. It can be. But it doesn’t have to be. Ok rant over. Also ALWAYS USE SUNSCREEN, neutrogena has a good sheer 70spf face one I use all over."
"these videos are easily the most profound thing on the entire internet"
"When you said the only thing you care about is being beautiful I felt like I was hearing my own mind speak. aka I want to look good too."
"Also youre fucking gorgeous i wouldnt have known youre trans if you hadn’t mentioned it. I just went follow you on instagram and you literally look like a NYC MODEL AND IM NOT LYING"
"This man is amazing."
"While we are being all honest with ourselves... Natalie, you look gorgeous. As a fellow plastic surgery patient, i can only wish you comfort and happiness in your slightly newer skin. As a straight woman though, today i am feeling a bit nostalgic for the hot dude you once were. You now look like a bff i want to get my hair done or fight the patriarchy with 😌😌"
"Thank you for this video. Lmao, toner rebalances the pH of your skin from water exposure. It also cleans out the dead skin and other skin products that was used previously."
"Your eyes are very big comparatively now. A good look. It makes you more mesmerizing."
"I adore this topic & discussion, it's a deep dive I didn't even realize I wanted it until I saw it. Also, happy to see you back!  And, since it's basically required- Your surgery results are somehow both subtle, in that it is very much still your face, but especially your jawline is strikingly different- at least from the front. It's really impressive. I hope you're happy with it, because it came out great"
"Great stuff as always!"
"That intro !!!!! Also I’m living for the purple cut crease I wish you’d actually do a makeup tutorial for real one of these days ❤️❤️"
"“The unintentional shade of it all”"
"<3 of course."
"Hey contra. Don’t know if you’ll see this or anything. But I’d just like to thank you for this video. As a closeted tgirl you talked about a lot of things that I also think about a lot. So, thanks for letting me I’m not alone in those thoughts and worries."
"sophie <3"
"Wish you wouldn't be so hyperbolic with the leftist talk. Attributing beauty standards solely to societal influences and conflating skin color with weight are very disingenuous. I guess it's probably part of the whole contrapoints personality, but i've always enjoyed your candid understanding that there are two sides to every argument"
"Holy shit? This is the first video of yours I watch because it popped up in my recommendations. You are the Alton Brown of Youtube. I mean his Good Eats era. This reminds me so much of his style. An expert in his field, he also had a good bit of education in film. So he brought a unique style to Food Network with his extremely educational and interestingly creative episodes. Awesome job. I’m entertained and subscribed"
"Omg girl you look so GOOOOOD!  Congrats!  Super proud of ya!  Hope its everything you wanted.  :)"
"You're so lovely and looks like Celine Dion"
"You remind me of my sister in your intellect, inner and outer beauty, and your humor in the face of hardship. You're honesty is as much an inspiration to me as she is."
"“I just want to be beautiful...” said every fuckin weirdo that hacks up their face and body to be anybody but themselves😂"
"Annoying edit: as fuck"
"great, now im gonna be stuck with serious thoughts all day.    in all serious though, thanks for the honesty and introspection. it's contagious."
"Love you natalie...you were beautiful before and you are beautiful now :)"
"Oh wow, I just can't concentrate on what's being said when a Gymnopedie is playing in the background."
"I had goosebumps because of that intro! Great video as always"
"I'll be completely honest with you Natalie, since that is what you'd probably prefer. While I don't think you're the most beautiful woman I have ever seen, I do in fact think you are very beautiful, both inside and out. That said, beauty is subjective. I'm sure there is someone out there who truly thinks that you are the most beautiful woman they have ever seen :)"
"Is that the Minecraft music playing in the background?"
"1:28 in and I FREAKING LOVE YOU."
"“If all the men died tomorrow...f...”"
"work on confidence darling .. not only looks you're already beautiful"
"So since today's trendy response is to review contra's physical appearance.. let's have a go at that I guess.   TBH babe, I actually kinda prefer the way you looked pre FFS. Like yeah your nose sticked out a little and your chin was more prominent but it really didn't look bad, much less did it look manly, I actually think it looked cute, it had a spritely elvish quality to it..   Not that my faceless rando comment matters or anything, if this new look let's you love yourself more then that's all the reason you need, but for the record I think you've looked gorgeous for a long time.  Now back to pretending to be above such petty trivialities as the hotness of my para-social baby mommy. You are my sinful dark mother and are welcome to step on my neck whenst you please <3  (PS. Really tho if you're reading this Natalie, please don't worry so much, also make more asmr)"
"Natalie, your videos inspire me. I love how you've taken the concept of a YouTube video and turned into something that is both a highly aesthetic art form, and a thought-provoking piece of intellectualism.  Watching your videos gives me a similar feeling to what I have after seeing an impactful classic movie, or after reading a deep book on philosophy or human nature.  Maybe you'll think I'm being hyberbolic, but I think you're doing something really profound here and I hope you realize that. 😊💜  Edit: Not to mention, your videos are funny, which is always a huge bonus, haha."
"Idk, i meet a good number of beauty standards and still i feel too ugly for Instagram. This video spoke to me in a personal level. Thank you so much, Contra 💕"
"Okay but you honestly look amazing. Not only you pass, you're an absolute queen, don't ever think otherwise. You are beautiful."
"i barely noticed that you look any different. but once you pointed out you do have a softer face that looks admittidly better but still 100% you"
"have you considered making a movie?? that intro felt like enter the void or sth"
"this channel is so refreshing bc theres lke an actual person here"
"Hey, Satans apple. I like it."
"Thousands of years ago Siddhartha Gautama said that suffering can be alleviated with the cessation of selfish craving and desire."
"I feel like the reason why I struggle with relationships is because I have it so heavily wrapped up in beauty, that only another person could love me if I'm beautiful. So on a day where I feel like a walking laundry sack, it could poison and contradict the words of a person who is very dear to me. I inadvertently throw my voice and I mock myself through the subtle speech and behavior of others.  Its hard being so radiant and social only to piss out my own insecurities and have it reverb through all the faces I love the most. Your video I think made me realize this, for a while I think I just thought I was overbearing and suffocating, i mean thats true, but to an extent I think its me laying my self worth so heavily on others that the whimsy of my frontal lobe can cause such social havoc. Maybe its kinda like my telekinetic power..."
"I love you, Mom"
"_'I find that my desires to look female, to look feminine, and to look beautiful, are not exactly the same, but they're woven together so tightly, that its kind of difficult to untangle them'_ Unfortunate that you can't make those distinctions, you must be confused with what it means to be female. It is not makeup, dresses, being hot, and going to parties. There are masculine women too, and they are just as 'woman' as every other woman.  You are missing the female part of your conception of what it means to be a woman. Trans women are feminine, but they are not the same as an actual biological women. I can understand if you want to feel like a woman, you are going to go with common markers (stereotypes, mannerisms) that will signal that to society, and to yourself, since you have no internal frame of reference. But don't get it mixed with what its actually like to live life as a female. You did not have that experience. You were born male. _'Feeling mannish, or dysphoric, usually goes along with feeling ugly'_ That isn't true. _'I don't just want to look female, I want to be beautiful'_ So you want to claim womanhood but not the ugly parts of it.  _'Vindictive transsexualism'_ This, but unironically. This is going to sound cold af but you aren't a woman, you're a preening narcissist. That whole thing about 'women sucking dick to get makeup' - not noticing that it was male prison guards who were providing it. No matter how much surgery or hormones you get, you will always feel ugly, because you have low self esteem. I think you need professional help. You might have thought transitioning was the answer, but it clearly wasn't. You are only going to feel worse. You need to accept yourself the way you are.  'Beauty is a symbol of life, its defying death' You and everyone else around will die one day. It is juvenile to hold on to that fear for so long without coming to accept your mortality.  Beauty is partly rooted in biology. Not sure why you didn't go over the association with beauty (symmetrical facial features, usually) and health. We like to look healthy, because often that means we _are_ healthy. But there can be a point when you take it too far, into vanity and narcissism, which is rooted in self-hatred and fear. I agree with your comments on style.   You use a lot of the ironic gaslighting tactics that the alt-right do. Like the last part of your video."
"lookin good, homegirl"
"I would also add that your older videos made me feel a tinge on edge, but now that's vanished with the big key light you have here. Overall cinematography has skyrocketed, and your videos look breathtaking now"
"More like Natalie Wwynnding Refn!"
"You are beautiful, before and after the FFS."
"you are always on point"
"Sophie!!!!!!!!!!!"
"What song is playing at 29:00?? It sound so familiar!"
"This comment will probably get flooded and I'm not even done with the vid yet but there's a big thing with society and treating femininity/beauty as a strictly nonintellectual thing but in reality those two things are disconnected. It feels good to look good idk what the problem is with looking good and working hard."
"natalie you with great with make up as well, but this is the first time i seen you without any of it i think and you look amazing omlllll   I love youuuu!"
"You look a little like villanelle from killing Eve, very pretty!"
"Woo hoo new video!!!!!"
"This is the biggest Ｍ Ｏ Ｏ Ｄ. Contra, I think I speak for a lot of people when I say that we unironically, and non-parasocially, love you and want to hug you. You're not just smart and beautiful, and a bunch of other adjectives, but also our sweet mother and daughter as well!"
"“It’s hard being a 6” 👏PREACH GURL👏"
"When I look in the mirror and I see this gross fat person. Even at 33 years old I can't seem to shake the perception. I've tried avoiding mirrors which helps a bit but is next to impossible. Even a few days ago I was hooking up with another 30 something guy. He was a really handsome dude,  very muscular, nice defined chest, thick mat of chest hair going up his neck.  And when we both had our shirts off he said 'wow you do work out a lot.' And he asked me to flex.   But for a brief  fraction of a second I didn't believe him, I was surprised.. And the next day I'm back to seeing a fat, undefined person in the mirrors at the gym.  This video was helpful to me. Thank You ContraPoints."
"you look great"
"4:36 I impulsively began to comment 'queen no!! you're the reason I first let myself think that I could be a beautiful tran!!' when I realized thr naturw of my consuming this as content and viewing you as simply an idol character to stan and feel like I can never match up to renders my compliments wholly un-acceptable as valid. Take my dopamine you georgeous bitch!"
"Hire an editor so you don't have to look at yourself as much and take 1200 mg l-theanine stat."
"you still pass better than anne colter."
"Oh my goodness you're so BRILLIANT"
"it's apparent immediately: you are more able to express your inner Contra. Watching you discover and grow more comfortable with yourself is amazing. thank you for sharing."
"I'm glad you addressed the elephant in the room - beauty. It's there and it's ugly and it doesn't give a fuck about your feelings or 'great personality'. And it never feels like enough. I wish you said you didn't care and it doesn't affect you, but you're only human as well. :("
"Damn you look good!"
"you may not look perfect according to society beauty standards, and i'll admit, that even to me, you're not the most conventionally beautiful of women, but i still think overall you are more than decent and i believe that if i was worthy of meeting you, i would be enamored by you as a complete person as a whole."
"FYI: You were are a beautiful woman before, and you are a beautiful woman now. Inside and out."
"PHONES LIVE IN A SOCIETY   god damn it"
"Natalie you are as beautiful as you ever were, since I started watching your videos back in 2017. I hope you find your peace."
"A few things:  1. Welcome to womanhood (from a cis gendered woman); self-loathing and fear of aging.  2. You are beautiful, pre and post op. BTW, my brother saw one of your pre-op videos (he was looking over my shoulder) and declared 'She looks like a hotter, younger Katherine Hepburn.'  3. One of the things my favorite Uni professor shared with her students was enjoy beauty in and of itself. She came to that conclusion after struggling through her studies, and how political the topic of beauty was, as a Fine Arts major at UNLV.  4. Liking and loving beauty - whether as a sculpture, a painting, a sunset or oneself - is part of human nature. So chill and appreciate your lovely and intelligent self. I do."
"Sugarpuff when you are 60 you'll look back at this and think 'I can't believe I thought I was getting old.' You'd kill to go back to this time. Enjoy your lithe youthful body RIGHT NOW, or at least let some other enjoy it. Maybe some sailors."

"'Conventional beauty' isn't a social construct.  It's a byproduct of our lizard-brain instincts."

"Omg stop it, you’re literally one of the most beautiful people on the entire fking internet"
"as a trans-masculine NB person (probably, I'm figuring it out ok) I connect compliments about my appearance to femininity. Like, any time someone compliments my looks, I hear, 'YOU'RE A WOMAN.' I've always really despised looks-based compliments and never understood why other women got flattered by it, and I never really got why until I acknowledged I'm trans.  Because like, people don't compliment guys on their looks!   I definitely developed a 'not like the other girls' hate-on for make-up and femininity, which I convinced myself was internalized sexism for oh, about fifteen years.   Of all things, it was K-pop that made me okay with the idea of make-up and fashion. Like, seeing men looking pretty but also masculine just blew my little fucking mind. So there's a cultural element there. Like white american guys try to pretend they don't care about looks (and are generally slobs) but in other countries, it's normal for guys to groom.   On a slightly unrelated note, I also suffered severe cystic acne growing up (like literally whole face inflamed and red, think the before picture on an accutane commercial) and I actually think it impacted me for the better—in the sense that I don't nitpick my appearance now, and now that my skin is mostly clear, I think wow! lookin' pretty good! Back when my face was fucked, I used to watch videos of people with extreme facial deformities to make myself feel better. There's something to be said for perspective."
"'Ew. Gross.' - I feel ya, sister."
"LOVE the point about being stylish and in the wider context than just fashion"

"You look like Ann Coulter."

"I really needed the perspective on beauty at the end, thanks contra :)"
"Well what if these women just don’t want to bother with make up and nails. Like they just don’t care about it. Or at least not enough to go through the effort."
"Is it bad that like 3 minutes in i'm so distracted by how PRETTY you look. you're becoming one of my style icons. also you're super smart and are such a vaulable addition to youtube and various discussions blah blah"
"You look like a young Céline Dion, but like, without the terrible 80s hair."
"DO YOU WANT YOUR FACE UNTONED?"
"aaaaaah, you're so pretty"
"As a 30 year old fat gay spoonie transman, I worry about beauty constantly because I am pre-every god damn thing and desperate as shit. Oh the balance of do I want to look like crap that may pass for male in dark lighting or do I want to be misgendered and laugh at myself for stepping outside in the first place until I break down in a pool of tears and subsequently hate myself for 'being weak'.  If I wear foundation to cover up my horrible red skin, as I have been trained to do for 15 years, does that invalidate my masculinity? Why the fuck is my masculinity viewed as so fragile and theoretical that a hint of CHAPSTICK can raze it to the ground???? God damn! I want to be pretty and masculine is that so wrong?? I have floral shirts that have been shelved until my chest is not encumbered by feminine fat lumps, and I want a beard more and more because it will provide the societal shield that will contextualize my entire being and allow me actual freedom of style and expression again. Even looking at all the blogs of transmen documenting their transitions don't help cause I'm not binary enough of a man by trans standards either, but I'm not non-binary so....  And the niche of awesome transmen and NBs on instagram that pull off that tightrope of masculine and beautiful is no place for fat, old, pre-everything, baby trans who is far from a baby. It's not cute and no one wants people like me there. So I just feel wholly inadequate and unattractive no matter what I do.   TLDR; This video is all kinds of #relatable and also I think Natalie is beautiful, and I don't even want her to choke me lol"

"As a less attractive person I have a few thoughts on the topic of beauty. I do think that it is in the eye of the beholder in some aspect. You can care about someone so much that they are beautiful to you. Love is blind as they say. You can also see beauty in things not other people do. I myself have found a curvy plus size woman with soft back rolls as attractive and I have never known why. I have drawn the perfect flat back many times and seen this 'standard' body countless times before me, but when I first came across that hourglass sharpei body type I was floored by it. I am not joking at all. I have seen it on trans and cis woman alike, and sometimes I am saddened that it's an admiration I could not express and have others understand. That feeling of being an 'outlier' from everyone else by feeling something is beautiful that others do not is similar to being an ugly person.    Most of my thoughts on beauty come from personal experience of both being attractive and not attractive. I think society as a whole is suffering body dysphoria and that dysphoria is from media. I do think it is a problem, but saying that I don't think that make up is bad or that the absolutely stunning people of this world should disappear from among us. I simply think we need to see more than just that, and much of the body dysphoria will decrease. We need to see ugly people before us on camera just as much as beautiful people. And not in a circus freak show type of setting or a documentary about how desperately sad life is for ugly people. As just simply existing among the world's beautiful people, which is just an honest reflection of reality. We need to see ugly people because people don't know how to live their lives as ugly. We need to see aged people because people don't know how to live their live as aged. If you compare the faces of media even a few decades back what we applaud now as steps forward for body positivity just... was.    So much of our reputation is on the internet. Given we are beings who desperately care about socialization it makes the internet an important part of many people's self esteem in many many aspects. This is probably why people cat fish knowing that in the end they will be caught. It's sad too because often watching the catfish videos I find very often that the person being catfished is actually not that attractive themselves. It's often not the horror story dynamic of an ugly old man catfishing a young attractive person. It's two people who are often both quite young who are actually very similar in attractiveness but one of them is less in way that it's enough to make them do the desperate thing. They cling to that difference like their life is over if they can't date up to that slightly more attractive level. Of course some would say that places like the beauty industry push for this sort of desperation but as an ugly person I can honestly say there is more reasons to wear make up than to up your attractiveness. No amount of make up will make someone like me more attractive to the majority of the world, and yet I do enjoy wearing it because it is fun and expressive.     I think that our society has mishandled beauty. We have an issue with bias. The incels are right in a way that the world is cruel to the ugly. It is a marginalization that isn't talked about. It does contribute to less competent people getting promotions or getting jobs or higher pay. Not always, but it does happen. It is unfair in the same way that other biases are unfair. The only way to go against this is to simply learn to be around people who are not beautiful. For beautiful people to be kind and supportive of people who are not. Beauty itself is not the problem. As an artist I will today and to my last day love beauty with all my heart. It's the isolation of others within the scope of beauty that is the problem. I think it fuels a fear of not being beautiful in most people because no one wants to be othered; no one wants to be isolated."

"critique: women not wearing makeup isn't masculine. makeup isn't an inherent part of femininity, and the absence of it isn't masculine, but entirely neutral. caring about beauty isn't exactly frowned upon among women in general, maybe in some radfem circles but even then i would say most people who are critical of 'the beauty industry' try not to judge other women for being affected by societal pressure. i guess some radfems roll their eyes at hyper-femininity bc they see it as self-harm.  i think there's a lot of cognitive dissonance where people are critical of capitalism, shallowness, beauty standards etc. but it's very difficult to actually live by those standards if you're susceptible to societal pressure like... most people"
"I don't know why, but for some reason I care way less about beauty than most people. Or at least in a different way. When I was a child I absolutly didn't want to look like a child and I hated looking and sounding like one. That's why I don't like being on photos and I would never upload Image or video of myself to the Internet. With that in mind, I kind of learned to not identify to much with how I looked and I displaced the thought about myself as somone who looks a certain way. I don't know if one would call that behaviour disphoria, alienation or if it is some completly different psychological mechanism.   Today (Im 20 now) it has gotten better with 'accepting' how I look (or more like getting used to),   because I still feel kind of distant to thinking about my own looks how I think other people do. The only time I actively worried about a detail, was a pretty big scar wich I concealed with Make-up or put a scarf on, and even in this situation it was less about thinking that the scar will make me look a lot more ugly, then it was about not wanting to be asked about and thereby associated with having had a disease and surgery, because I didn't want it to become part of my identity to others, when I myself didn't see it as that much of a life changing thing One could say I had cancer patient disphoria. I felt like a person who didn't have that traumatic experience (because I didn't fill that situation with that much meaning, never liked the dramatic way of how people cope with those situations) One could say in those regards Im kind of like Meursault from The Stranger.   Anyway,it isn't that I don't sometimes feel unattractive or want to look different.   But for being obsessed with changing my looks I would have to know how I want to look,   therefor I would have to know how I feel that I look, but I exactly don't know that.   It's super strange and with other people too. I, for example couldn't tell you what look I find attractive. One time a frind asked me (how many guys do regularly) If I thought a particular girl (I barely knew) was hot. I didn't know what to say, so I said 'I barely knew her so I couldn't tell' but by todays beauty standards 'yes, she would probably be considered hot'. I find some looks more attractive, but I can never tell why (maybe because I associate certain looks with personality traits of former crushes and relationships). I also don't really like the look of the 'beauty standard', because it looks kind of dull and boring and comercials have tought me to ignore it. + maybe I associate it with 'The Rich' wich I despise from a political point of view. Wich is all kind of sad becaus I worry about having a lot of prejudice about people who look like that.   Dear reader,  Hope you can relate to something or at least appreciated the trip into my wired psyche"

"I feel that Beauty has value. Sure some are born with more attributes which allow them to be seen as beautiful than others. But some people are born more intelligent than others as well and we value that. We also applaud efforts to become more intelligent or knowledgeable. Why should the pursuit of beauty be seen as vain but the pursuit of knowledge  a virtue?"
""
"I once looked up the definition of ugly and the result I got was “offensive to look at”. Upon reading that I actually cried because I realized this is how we take in the very very unattractive. I thought how terrible it would be for someone to have to exist not wanting to be seen because they know being seen offends the viewer. I also realized that means conversely that if ugliness offends then beauty pleases. And if offending people is undesirable then pleasing people is desirable. And if that’s true than the pursuit of being more beautiful is not simply vanity but rather a virtue."

I have always thought you were beautiful, but, I get how you feel. I too get far more compliments on my appearance than I feel I deserve, so I demean the comment with a self-deprecating joke.  You are an inspiration to a truly ageing cross-dressing trans-something or other. I was once accused of being a cross-dressing transsexual. I am still trying to figure that one out. I don't even like the term transsexual.  I do what I do for no-one but myself. I am not trying to attract a man and as far as sex goes, I am more into women overall than men, though there is one part of a man that I do like. Hmmmm, I wonder what that could be. So I am torn between being a straight male or a gay female. Gawd, life would be so much easier if I was a homosexual. At best I am bi, but just barely. Well, maybe just barely. You rock girl. Luv ya.

"It's different for women who are truly ugly. I had buck teeth that could put an eye out by age 8. By the time the orthodontics took, I was fat. Then I developed severe PCOS and got facial hair. I used to wear a full face of makeup all the time in high school. By college, I was down to just foundation to cover the beard shadow. I have never enjoyed makeup, but I wore it because I also hate being misgendered. I also hate doing my hair. It's falling out now too. I cover it with a head scarf to keep people from calling me 'sir.' I'm fat, balding, hairy and autistic. The journey from where I am to anything like beauty is so far that I gave up long ago. But I still spend money and do annoying shit like laser hair removal just so I can hopefully blend in and not be verbally abused for being ugly. And style is not an option for me because I'm poor and nice clothes don't come in my size anyway. I have often wondered about my gender identity. If I care so little about hair and makeup and clothes and traditional feminine things, and I look masculine anyway, shouldn't I just be a trans man? That feels like an easier option until someone calls me 'sir' and I cringe to my very soul. In the end, my gender is just a woman who is very bad at it."

"You're still a little bit clockable but I think shading? blending? that make up magic with foundation and shit would take care of that edge that you're trying to get in the pursuit of ever-elusive femininity. (Im cis and chubby with big boobs, in academia. Before I was, maybe a couple of incels would try to make me feel bad by 'doubting' my femininity, and GURL...haha)  I'm not a diehard fan because of your take on dreadlocks but I am subscribed and my mom's a doc, so I've lived with people obsessed with bone structure as well, lol. Remember to do your neck as well (with the contouring thing I mean, to make it look slimmer). You can go for more surgery but honestly you'd still want to do make up if you want to be traditionally pretty, so I'd say forgo more procedures and invest in make up lessons and expensive shit, I guess. And experiment with your hair, maybe waves or 'beach hair'. Volume is tantalizing, after all, lol. Also the color, if you don't mind dying it, get a consultation on some fancy ass place to see what is the best shade with your complexion and all of that. And regarding surgery, yes you could sculpt your cheeks more but honestly...99% of people -including ciswomen- fuck their structure and it rarely -if ever- looks good so...really, just make up. And even though I don't wear make up I am an authority on the matter because I am a Latina, born and bred, so you know I've been bombarded with unattainable beauty AND sensuality standards my whole freaking life, lol. Hope this helps. Love from a student in the Netherlands. Ah, if you could make your face more oval, so shave a millimeter or two from your temples, that would help. But honestly, I don't know. Make up make up make up. Your eyes are pretty set in, so the makeup should (somehow, no idea how it would be done) take depth away from them. I guess less black eyeliner? If you do do surgery, get one or two millimeters shaved from your brow area. That really does a world of difference."

"I really don't think that it is fair to assume that women who don't wear makeup (subconsciously) only want to be taken more seriously by men or be 'different than other girls'. Personally I have just genuinely never felt an urge to put anything in my face other than water. When I was forced to wear makeup for a school project I didn't feel like myself, it felt like I was wearing a mask instead of my own face. Just wanted to point that out, otherwise this is a great video as always."

BUT I WASN’T FROWNING!!” My expression was neutral, what came to be called Resting Bitch Face."
"I really loved her nose before, but it looks good now too"
"I'm so glad for this video, honestly. I've always struggled with how I look. I've never been thin, I've always been hairy. I spent years trying to cultivate good feelings about myself, inside and out. I dealt with two sort of earth-shattering traumas in the space of 5 years or so, then metaphorically clawed my way back to some semblance of normality through sheer force of will and therapy. I found meaningful friendships, a romantic relationship that fulfills me, I completed a bachelor's degree and then a master's degree, I got a job at a prestigious university. I built up self-confidence in all of those personal areas, and along the way had come to terms with my body. I'd say that I wasn't entirely happy with how I looked, but I didn't hate myself.  Then last year, about this time, I got cancer at age 25. I lost almost everything. I had to give up that great job that, due to capitalistic indoctrination, I had used to underpin so much of my identity. My relationship stayed strong - but we had to learn to deal with a relationship dynamic that no longer matched the one we had agreed on. And my body completely failed me at every turn. My hair, which had been so, so long my entire life, fell out, of course. The regimen of medication I was put on weakened me so much I couldn't exercise, wasted my muscles, and caused me to retain fat and water. I'm the heaviest I've ever been. I should be grateful to be alive, but all I can see is another situation where I have to rebuild my life from scratch. This combined with my other traumas made me question whether I even wanted to try to rebuild all of this. What's the use of accomplishing anything if it just keeps getting taken away over and over? I do it now (as I have done for years) for other people, and not really for myself.  I don't think I've ever despised my body so much as I do now. I'm working hard to regain my strength and feel good about myself again. And I really had to check the privilege that I did have before, to be able-bodied, to at least not hate my body even if I didn't like it much. I'm about 9 months cancer free. But the experience, the toll on my physical self and my emotional self - those are mine to keep. Forever.   So hearing this helps. I want to feel beautiful again. I didn't always feel it before, but when I did, it propped up all of the other things that I liked about myself. I was successful, smart, kind, and beautiful. Now I'm a work in progress. These feelings of guilt for even wanting to be beautiful are even more pronounced when you're disabled - the feeling is 'oh, well you have enough to worry about! Don't worry about being beautiful too!' And nothing tears down beauty standards quite like finally being free of all that unwanted hair - only you have to lose all of it, even the hair you like! So thank you for this nuanced take, from one Natalie to another."

You are an irreplaceable person, to me, and know I don’t really know you but you are one of the only reasons why I use YouTube. I am feeling hurt and angry right now too over beauty. I’ve tried to think of it as I can not be more or less “pretty” than something I am bound to (universe). If someone like you can think they are not pretty then I really need to understand this game I’m playing is a losing one. P.S I don’t trust anyone who doesn’t look ill without makeup."

I can't say I am perfectly happy with my body on account of being trans, but even then it feels more like physical discomfort more than self hatred. To those out there suffering of body image issues, I want you to know that it can get better. I didn't always feel like this and I did struggle to get here. Seek counseling if you can, and surround yourself with nonjudgmental people who care about you. You can do this"

"Okay but that was straight up anxiety inducing at the beginning"
"I really appreciate your detailed analysis of beauty, femininity, and the way society largely portrays womanhood. That being said, I had a concern about something you said. I don't wear makeup, but it's not because I'm trying to be taken seriously or doing some 'not like other girls flex.' I just don't like makeup. Same thing with lesbians....a lot of women in my pride club are super dedicated to fashion, beauty, and femininity."
"Congrats! You totally pass!"
"This video is as lovely as you are. I'm a boring cis woman, and I also struggle with how I look. This may sound dumb, but when I'm particularly down on myself, I watch the video 'Am I Pretty' by The Maine-this isn't a plug just a fan speaking out. Btw, I think you are beautiful. Beautiful, funny, and intelligent. Girl, you are the total package. ❤"
"Your last part had the most power. Because it's pretty much what a lot of incels and similarly obsessed people don't understand I think. Insecurity is one of the ugliest traits you can have. Sure, develop your style any way you want, even with plastic surgery if you're that unhappy with your look. But the most important thing is that you're able to rock it. Keep your head high and headbutt any people who want to diminish you."
"My crush, way older than me, is a pretty busty, tall and chunky woman. Everything about her is wider and bigger than me. Her jaw, her eyes, mouth, arms, legs.  I'm young and I guess kind of good-looking. Just skinny and a little short. We look absurd next to each other. I suspect she doesn't feel very feminine with me.. In some ways she looks more masculine than me, but at the same time not at all. I once saw her without makeup, and she did look sick, old and tired, but I still found her sexy.  Then she cut all her hair of, and I really didn't like it, but she still turned me on. I even mistook her for a man on the street once, from a distance. She in no way has a masculine face, it's very feminine actually, but she's not small and frail or any of that. It kind of highlights her feminine traits even more. In her case, her eyes, nose, mouth, and her voice and softness. When she was younger and skinnier she must have been amazingly beautiful. I think many still find her good looking and attractive, partly thanks to her style and sensual communication.  This story had no point."

I don't think i do   Reason why i feel comfortable doing that is partly because of you contrapoints i owe you so much"

"As a lesbian I can confirm we are 'straight chillin.' Every girl is already perfect so we dont care"
"I've recently been questioning my gender identity really hard, but I've discovered that instead of being intertwined, my desire to medically transition and to be beautiful pretty strongly conflict with each other. I haven't figured whether or not I really want to start T, whether or not I want to look like a guy, but I have figured out that I'm scared it will make me ugly, and it's making it hard to figure things out."

"I'mma keep getting in the way of your attempts to make crude stereotypes! I defy the very meaning of stereotype! Which, ironically, makes me the stereotypical anti-stereotype, I guess. Anyways, I am delighted by this video. Seems like you are really getting your stuff together and finding a good balance in life. I just want to say, in general, you have always looked like an androgyne-toward-the-feminine to me, personally. Like, I perceive you as 95% female and 5% boy, if that makes any sense. Personally, I like that bit of boy I see in you, and I hope you hold on to it even as you transition. Carry it through the transition, let the boy become the tomboy! ;D I know nothing can calm the agitations of self criticism but, personally, you always come across to me as clean, smooth, youthful, ladylike, etc. Even your 'base face' at this point is just perfect to me. That's just me, though. >.> I think you will always 'feel the way you felt before'. I say this as a person who is in that same boat. I am like an opposite side to your coin. I have embraced the decay. That is not to say I don't try to beautify myself to a degree, but, I don't do as much as I could. You, on the other hand, you go all out and you nail it. And that makes me genuinely wish you would nail me some day. ;p"

"I guess the thing that really helped me was training myself to see non beauty and inherently harmless and unrepulsive, rather than forcing myself to pretend I didnt care about beauty. Even I was the most perfect specimen in the world, theres eventually going to be days where I develop pimples, or gain weight, and I know its sounds silly but all those things used to feel like unforgivable crimes to me when I was younger, instead of being relatively minor happenings with no real impact on my life. Not only that they're nowhere as disgusting as coded by alot of skin care adverts; my gf once told me my pimples were kind of cute and my dark circles were adorable and I know she meant it, and it's the same way I treat her so why wouldn't that be hard to accept? I think our skincare is also a way for us to reaffirm the idea of being precious or worth investing and non beauty shouldnt make us stop that. And I say non beauty because it frees me from the burden of trying to love things I find genuinely ugly about myself or in other people. Idk it's worked for me as someone with body dysmorphia and I hope everyone else finds a way to work with their insecurities as well"
"I love your videos but I think you might have made some really unfortunate assumptions about women who choose not to wear makeup, and oversimplified the problem with beauty. I’m not against makeup, I put on a minimal amount of makeup if I want to. (Tinted moisturizer, brow gel, mascara, blush) . I just want to look and feel like myself, so I don’t bother most days. I just think that we all have been indoctrinated to care a little too much about how we are seen by other people, and not enough about how we contribute to the world and our communities. I think she never addressed the largest issue with beauty standards: Beauty is not a virtue. And even if our society treats it like it is, we shouldn’t. Women especially are reared to care about beauty as a matter of self worth and that’s what made me uncomfortable with this video. It didn’t address that but shifted the focus to style. And while I find her solution interesting, I think style is also problematic for the same reasons beauty standards are: you are basing some of your worth solely on how you look on a given day, and some people are systematically barred from building and propagating their own aesthetics because of class and body shape. More than anything I think that she left out a real possibility: choosing to be upfront about these issues and not taking part in the problematic behavior that the beauty-industrial complex urges us to. What if we didn’t give people attention because they are nice to look at, what if we were so comfortable with ourselves that wearing makeup was truly a matter of style, and not something that we use to boost our self esteem, what if we consistently refused to make womanhood a performance, what if we treated beauty as simply another characteristic, like height, shoe size, right handedness, or or the ability to smell asparagus in your pee. We all recognize those things in others but it’s rarely attached to their worth. And we can change society too! Society and cultures only change when individuals in them push social norms by simply embodying their values. For Queer people, we had to come out of the closet and live out our love in the open. For minorities we openly exercise and protect our cultures even when it’s hard. And for women we have to separate beauty from our self worth and how we perceive others. We need to check our beauty biases, and we need to realize that feeling beautiful isn’t the only way to appreciate our bodies."

I worry every single day that it's too late, that I'll get clocked everywhere I go.  To say the NHS haven't been helpful would be an unstatement. Bounced around from doctor to doctor, from clinic to clinic. Only for it all to be put on hold for a year as I fell through the cracks and no one noticed. If I had the money. But I don't,  I know I should be saying to myself that 'you look amazing' or 'don't care what people think' but I do care.  Im scared that I'll never pass. That I'll always be outed /clocked."

"Beauty is veery in perspective.You are your own judge of the beauty not the system made to appeal for just men or smth. Become a fashion advisor,boost up your confidence. Search for amazing people that Rock themselves in any shape and color.   Maybe wear brighter make-up.There's no doubt you have got a fashion sense more than anyone. Here's to me I would add being a bit taller and sturdy when for some others a certain fixed standard would be perfect nonetheless. Maybe there's lots of insecurity thoughs coming from your environment about themselves(trans, girls women, etc), then affecting you, like a copied thinking, without knowing. Being much more cuter and younger would be just genes and applying a few make-up I think. Nonetheless I wouldn't force or psychologically torture myself for a change, ironically, said rich pretty girl, if needed there's another generation still able for growing and adapting to climate, atmosphere etc. You look very much as a woman, with a male genes and some of its social construction followed, you're doing preeeeety Excellent!"
"The question of 'Where does Corrective surgery stop and cosmetic surgery begin?' is an interesting one.

Thanks for talking about your desire to be beautiful, because i feel the same way, but it's hard to admit, because i can't be beautiful with a deformity. I want to be beautiful because i want to be treated at least like a person without a deformity, because i don't want to feel need to hide my face, unlike people without a deformity, i don't want to think about my deformity every single day, i don't want to be jealous, i don't want to be bitter, i don't want to be demoralized for a long time whenever  i hear someone talking bad things about an appearance of a person without a deformity. I am sorry, but that is just how my brain feels. I also don't take photos of myself and i don't know how everyone, in case i am included, facetunes their photos. Like, do i really need to facetune fragments of school's textbooks? Tho, can i be stylish, if i have a deformity?"

"7:13 '…but in fact, gender dysphoria is not sealed away in a vacuum away from the influence of societal ideals and norms'   Seriosly, what if we lived in a society where it would considered really feminine to have a square jaw and lots of facial body hair, and really masculine to have a smaller frame and bigger hips? That would prevent so much dysphoria and money-spending."
"I was so sad she didn't stand up--I really want to know if that's a gorgeous shirt or a gorgeous dress :) that said.... I was also super excited for a make up tutorial. Whatever, I own my desire to be a six too!"
"I have an issue where I don't recognize my face as my own in mirrors or even photographs.  I have to stand there for about 10 minutes convincing myself that the individual i'm seeing is a face that belongs to me before I can even put on makeup without feeling incredibly strange, and if I don't keep alert, I scare myself when I pass mirrors.   It's given me an extremely... detached relationship with my appearance and body.  Whenever I try to look nice because I actually want to, I feel like a marionette jerking harshly through steps made for a much more graceful dancer.  Is that how it feels for you in a way?  This entire thing has been making me think and look into things i've been avoiding thinking about.  I feel a quiet horror at the idea that I'm looking at my own issue with such a dispassionate, clinical eye, and yet what you're describing seems deeply emotionally painful, and I want to understand better so I can do better about helping my friends going through these same issues without being a clumsy, well-meaning but accidentally hurtful/insulting idiot about it all, y'know?  And this has made me realize maybe i'm only capable of empathizing only so far with them all.  ANd I think that upsets me more than anything.  How can I do the right thing for my friends if I can't even understand what that might be?"

"This video is so refreshing, though I am one of those women who can't be bothered with leg shaving or makeup most of the time. I was surprised to hear some of the things about how you feel about yourself - you've never ever stricken me as manish, aging or unattractive. Literally, not once. And let me just say...while I don't think there's anything positive to be gained from sharing my opinion about Jeffree Star...there is no comparison between you in terms of beauty. Not that Jeffree is terrible, just that you and Jeffree are very different creatures and you come out very blessed by the comparison (gosh this sounds way bitchier toward Jeffree than I mean it to!)"
"Hmm I think some of the confusion is that you're very visually creative. For those of us who aren't as much (writer here haha...and I imagine some of the academics you used to hang out with are similar), it's just not an easy way for us to express ourselves, so that essentially means it's a lot of work for mediocre results. I'm still vain and that's why I work out/eat well, but I'm not going to make myself look amazing with makeup/clothes anyway so it's easier to impress in other ways."
"The most brutal thing about this: I have no style. I've tried, I just don't."
"Honestly as a lesbian, my concept of beauty has shifted a lot since accepting that I am a lesbian. It's a bit hard for me to put into words but I just don't care anymore about what other women do to be beautiful and I feel the most 'beautiful' when I feel the most myself. Though I can still be very self conscious abt my body hair sometimes"

We are all obsessed with what we perceive to be our weakest point... and most people are not very comfortable even acknowledging what that is in them.

And there is nothing wrong with seeking power to improve your quality of life. So long as, you know, you dont crush the skulls of lots of innocents along the way (which is unlikely because we're talking about beauty here, not global domination).   I figured i'd make some witty comment on Foucault and power dynamics and how it legitimizes your decisions, but you know it better than i. So feel free to insert your own adlib. Peace!"

"Looking in the mirror gets a lot easier when you're just resigned to looking like shit 24/7"
"So like, I like the idea of prioritizing style over beauty, but I also feel like that would just replace privileges based on physical appearance with those based on class, you know?     Having a curated and distinct style is expensive (either in terms of money or in terms of time, labor and skill level needed to make and/or alter clothes) and inaccessible to many people, especially fat people and people with atypically-shaped bodies. There's also the mental and emotional energy costs of putting together haschtague lewks all the time, as well as the extra care and awareness they might necessitate; I'm thinking of this one pair of white shoes that I never wear because they're impossible to clean and constantly avoiding getting them dirty is exhausting. For a lot of working class people, particularly those already in marginalized groups, style is a luxury they can't afford.  I realize We Live In A Society and so it's inevitable that our value is going to be tied somehow to wealth and economic class, but I just feel like many of the same people who currently get shat upon for not being '''beautiful''' enough would also be shat upon for not being stylish enough. But then again, I don't really have a good alternative suggestion besides, like, not basing our worth as human beings on the free market exchange value of our lives but LOLZ GOOD LUCK WITH THAT"
"I don’t give a shit about beauty. But I do resent the fact that, because I don’t care about beauty, it will negatively impact me in terms of my professional life and how much respect I’ll get from others. Studies back this up. Any woman is forced to have a relationship to the beauty industry, whether she engages with it or not. Whether she chooses, like Contra, to use surgery and makeup to both express herself and deal with mental issues, or, like me, she chooses not to wear jackshit and likely takes a social or professional blow. Trans women have a particularly rough road with regards to this. It’s a bummer."
"Can someone please paint Starfishnight 😂😂"
"it does not and should not matter, and especially not from some rando guy on the internet: you look beautiful, no lies."
"I find your video very interesting because I´m currently writing my bachelor thesis about sex work, sex robots and sex as a commodity. Doing my reasearch I read an interesting book from a sociologist who writes about how the body, especially the female body, is a commodity - literally and in a symbolic way. Thesis is (simplified): the sexualised body generates capital and women can, in theory, generate capital and economic power with their bodies (so it`s not the main focus to attract a partner - thats just one out of many reasons, most of the time we don`t try to be attractive to achieve something conciously. It`s to avoid disadvantage and to fit in). But because sexualised bodies are everywhere, the female body is often degraded, the beauty standards for women count on short-living standards (like youth) and there is so much competition, it is hard to generate economic or symbolic worth. That is the point of capitalism: The commodified sexual body has to lose worth and you constantly have to regain that worth. And we all know how money can be generated with the pressure to be attractive: Clothes, makeup, surgery, dieting... You name the industry. I just thought throwing that out might be interesting. For me it was."

"Yeah just cause I'm aware of how fucked it all is doesn't mean my gay trans ass isn't trying to be the cutest lil twink boy, obsessing over my waist to hip ratio on the daily. BUT yeah I have found that valuing style over conventional beauty is probably one of the best ways of looking at it and accepting the inevitable ageing process. Feeling like I have great style, at least for me, does actually work, and also embracing the non-binary and androgynous aspect of my identity is pretty liberating too and helps me not to view cisness as the ideal."

"10:00 I think it's not them trying to be taken seriously it's just a lack of action on their part. why is femininity defined by action (plucking, shaving, waxing, bleaching, exfoliating, fake-tanning, whitening, gluing fake eyelashes on) and masculinity defined by inaction? (letting body hair grow out etc?)"

"The best thing about turning 40+ is that you really don't give a shit anymore about how others might react to you. ;) Beauty goes anyway and keeping it is too much work when you're working full time and have health issues. There are more pressing matters to life than looks. Don't waste time on it that you could spend with awesome people."

"Your a fine wine! STFU with your redundant self criticism of an over analytical disposition. Accept your beautiful and keep making content!"
"Grooming customs around body hair never made sense to me. Greeks and Romans removed pretty much everything, because anthropocentrism and cult of the human body. Middle Ages stepped back from anything remotely vain or groomful because something-something body sinful and flesh filthy, why bother. In consecutive eras the customs changed a bit here and there, for instance XVIII century men would be likely to get all smooth while it wasn't in fashion for women. And all the way to XX century women didn't bother aside from the parts of their body that were showing, which was literally nothing (try to show an ankle as an Edwardian lady and you'd have gentlemen fainting around you). But because the industrial revolution and emancipation that followed from 1920's onward resulted in fashion changes, women were suddenly showing way more skin. So everything that was now not covered by cloth had to look nice and smooth... Men, however, had long trousers and long sleeves for most of the time, so it wasn't of concern for them. However, their attire also got less modest(?) to the present day, it's just the habits regarding body hair haven't exactly caught up. Some of them start to take care of themselves, but overall there's indeed way less pressure and you can easily see a man wearing shorts with his furry legs showing. Not a sight anyone really wants to see, so maybe over some extended period of time we will see that changing as well. Who knows"
"...secretly falling in love with girls and slowly dying in the inside... Why am I so.... chastity...."
"As a guy, it took me a while to figure out that women don't primarily try to 'look good' for the sake of attracting others, but to feel good about themselves. I deal with depression, so I know what it's like to be willing to try anything if it means feeling better. Plastic surgery isn't about vanity. It's about wellbeing. I respect people's pursuit for happiness."

"No one feels beautiful or handsome. Everyone sees and emphasises their flaws. The trick, in all honesty, is just to accept that and live with it. That's not 'nice' because coasting uncomfortable feelings is disconcerting and unnerving but sometimes you just have to feel bad. Happily, though, that isn't as defeatist as it sounds. Remember, feelings are temporary and if you allow a feeling to hover within you rather than attempt to quash it, it will fade of its own accord. So, yes, do what you need to do to make the best of yourself, absolutely do that. Just remember, you'll still see your flaws in the mirror...and that is sad... but it's life."
"'Feral cat wandering the aisles of the liquor store'  Fuck, you just found my gender"
"Well the surgery definitely did something, because I find myself hypnotised by how makeup accentuates your new features.  It doesn't inspire me to headbutt a running chainsaw at all. I mean the teeth of the carbide dragon would only blunt against the implacable armada of hairs erupting from my face anyway.  Indeed, the only recourse that I can see is to double my facial experience by receiving Facial-Facial Feminising Surgery."
"Do you guys have an alibi, if not you're ugly ...  I'll leave now."
"(As always, mad respect to Natalie, and this comment isn't meant as a judgment of her or her decisions at all. I admit that I'm bothered by this topic and I'm trying to figure out why.) I think the thing that bothers me about people (okay, mainly just cis women) going to expensive, invasive lengths to conform to beauty standards is that the more the general population molds themselves, the higher the bar keeps rising for everyone. We're collectively pushing the standards farther and farther away from what's actually in our genetic code.   You almost have to get plastic surgery just to look normal. You have to spend hundreds of dollars every month on creams and makeups and treatments in order to really stand out as beautiful unless you're very young and very blessed. And if you opt to spend your money and time on other things, you risk being outright ugly in the eyes of society. It's a conundrum for me because I know that I value other things more highly than the way light bounces off of me, and yet that deep desire to be beautiful is there and it gets harder and harder to fulfill with both age and rising standards working against me.  What does it say about our value as people? And what we value? We spend so. much. money on this shit. And it's none of my business how other people choose to spend their money, but the fact that we feel compelled, pressured, even obligated to buy this crap is what I'm not okay with. It's a vicious, self-perpetuating cycle, and people are getting rich off of it.  I can't help thinking that if we could just resist a little bit, things might be better. If we could post photos of our actual faces. If we could quit pointing out our flaws. If we could dare to look imperfect once in a while and try to celebrate and praise other things besides beauty."
"So what does a tranny do when they are balding? Just wigs or implants?"
"Pretty sure why we think we want something is separate from why it is important and how it affects the world around us. Maybe you don't put on makeup to attract men, but whatever 'beauty' you hope to attain is in direct correlation with what men find desirable, and it does affect your relationships with men and other women. To expect otherwise is either naive or intentionally ignorant."
"How you manage to be that amazing???"

"Maybe I sound like the biggest sourpuss of all time, but it's almost painful to see so many people in the comments chanting 'you are beautiful!' as if all that Natalie needs to be convinced of her own beauty is a critical mass of reassurance from her fans. It seems to me that even if compliments from strangers provide a temporary rush of dopamine, so much focus on Natalie's physical appearance ultimately feeds into an obsession with beauty that's clearly causing her to suffer. The endless demands of adhering to conventional beauty standards are agonizing enough for cis women, trans women are subject to even harsher scrutiny, and yet the overwhelming response to a video deeply exploring that struggle is a chorus of people saying 'look how pretty you are!' This video helped me better understand the social and psychological role of make-up and facial surgery, and I like the idea of 'style' being a separate concept that could perhaps supplant or stand in for conventional beauty, as it seems far more personal and meaningful than simply judging one's proximity to an unattainable ideal. But in the end I was left feeling concerned for Natalie, who seems so dismally resigned to forever chasing that ideal to her own detriment. It would be one thing if she relished the pursuit, as many seem to, but it's pretty clear that the desire for beauty causes more pain than joy in the case of Natalie and perhaps the majority of women, cis and trans alike. Where do we go from here? Because I don't think we're getting anywhere by building social media echo chambers of relentless positivity."
"You are beautiful hilarious and I love you that is all lol"
"I sympathize. My Grad degree is in Philosophy and work as a full time teacher now. I would always pride myself in being more the 'intellectual' type that was supposedly above the frey when it came to 'frivolities' of this kind. In retrospect, I think it was the privilege of youth that allowed me to keep my mind off of it. It wasn't until I was 26 when I started noticing the corners of my hairline receding that my appearance became a greater focus. I'm in my early 30's now and, other than that, I still have a full head of hair, but I did consult a dermatologist about my options in case things got worse. I'm not proud to admit it, but, like you, I am more concerned with how I look than I probably should be."
"I just want to admit that as a male, I find myself seeing you as very attractive and hope that others can see that as well. I honestly only started watching your videos last year, but I have always viewed you as a woman. And, of course, your content is just BURGEONING more and more. Keep bringing us great thought-soup for the bread ration. Always thankful and very happy for you."
"I will say when I first started watching your channel I had no idea you were trans until you said you were. My first video was your incel one."

"Self improvement is a lifelong project. The idea that the whole of society should change instead is never going to happen, and it shouldn't.

There's a middle ground, you know."

"As a cis woman this video touched something in the back of my brain I always avoided thinking about... Beauty and the concept of beauty and how conflicted I am because of that desire of being beautiful, knowing damn well it's shallow and stressful.   I can't help going through instagram and stalking these beautiful women and feeling so... inadequate.  (especially when I found my crush liking their photos and commenting on their breathtaking looks) People always tell me I'm pretty and sometimes I feel like that, but I know I will never be as beautiful as those girls... I used to think, well, at least I'm an interesting person (?? ... And I have a nice body...  Well, those girls are beautiful and very interesting too, they have the whole package, something that I don't have.  Then, comes the guilt, as you said, first because I don't have it as bad as other people, second, there are more important things to focus on (even on a personal level) and here I am feeling depressed because there are women more beautiful than I'll ever be... How pathetic, having first world problems living in a third world country!"
"I love the way you describe beauty vs style! I think that's a great idea!"
"15:08 Or women wear makeup to get respect/acknowledgment/positive attention from everyone around her"

I was thinking of going to Dr. Z but wanted to consider other options. Thanks meow:3 Love you channel and super proud of you!"
"I love you. Way to serve it... So look, I’m a cis white b!tch with big t!ts and was once pretty. But now my a$$ would be sagging to the ground if I didn’t hoist that sh!t to the gym. We won’t speak about the sagging of said t!ts. Gravity is a harsh mistress.  So yeah, I’m about to hit 50. And I am no longer valuable or attractive. I swear it’s bc my only value is the ability to pop out babies for cis white bois. I’m not only no longer beautiful, I’m no longer visible. But guess what? I’m not playing their game. I’m not your womb on wheels.  Your video was AMAZING and inspiring and reminded me that my beauty is for me. It’s not like I’d let those judgey bois anywhere near me anyway. I’m gonna wear what I want (I do anyway. My spawn calls me Goth Mrs Weasley. At least it’s a look?) and gonna makeup how I want.  Now I think it’s time for midday skin care, I need to rub snail snot all over my face and mist with a $50 bottle of what I think is tap water and a drop of toilet cleaner.  I freaking love you. Thank you for this. Keep posting. Also I’m totally jealous of your elegant long neck."
"As A tRaNs MaN, I always feel a pressure from society to hypermasculinize. BUTT I have always had a thing for trying to be beautiful. What can I say except that my brain contains a raging biological twink. My dream style has always been 'rainbow goth smashed haphazardly into a hot elven dude' look. I've had top surgery and was on T for several years, but also I love my hair long, and I love gender-ambiguous clothing, I wear eye-shadow and nail polish, and I love confusing the cishets. It took me years after coming out to be comfortable doing any of that though, as I was constantly misgendered if I wore anything except plaid buttoned shirts, baggy pants, and short boring hairstyles. Then I said fuck it, and I still get misgendered a lot but I got to the point where I stopped giving a shit what random strangers said about me.  In any case, thank you for being so honest and vulnerable with us. If you enjoy beauty, enjoy it! It is lots of fun to get all dolled up. You don't have to give up something you love to do in order to deal with the inner demons that make you feel shitty about yourself. I wish you all the best in facing them and I hope you feel better soon! <3"
"Why do I wanna boop her snoot?!"
"So this is where the worldwide sequin shortage comes from! (Well, you and Takarazuka Revue, I suppose.) That style working great for you <3. I would love to be beautiful and/or stylish, but that would require effort and in the end what always wins is me being lazy. I last wore make-up going to see Bohemian Rhapsody at the end of last year... so I (cis F, presumably) cosplayed as a 30+ guy cosplaying a schoolgirl, which... kinda worked for me :D. When I do put on make-up I always end up looking as 'still me', which is the wrong thing to look like, so that successfully kills all motivation to do it again anytime soon. Too much effort for not enough difference. So, there's that, not having enough f**** to give...  Also, Detective Pikachu is so adorable and fluffy and I want one. Pronto!"
"Does someone know the name of the painting behind the skull lady ?"
"Really good results, Natalie. I'm happy for you. (Not just sucking you off lmao)   Hate to be that stereotypical (trans) guy, but hurrdurr I like you more without makeup hurrdurrr. That being said, it's true. I was honestly a little shocked at how good your results were in that skincare bit. Like, damn. Wig snatched kween.   I'm working to get my top surgery done and I'm trying to keep that bit in mind -- it probably won't completely revolutionize my self image. I want it to, though. God damn I'm so ready.  Just gotta wageslave for a little more time."
"I found it interesting when you refered to yourself as a 'smart person'. It can be so crazy how twisted our identities and beliefs can become just from what you were told as a little kid. For me personally as a kid I was never smart, or funny, but just pretty. This definitely led me to focus on beauty, and eventually developed a dysphoric view of what it was. Now I really am confused by the idea of it, and as someone who has been in and out of treatment for an eating disorder at this point I am TERRIFIED of what beauty is. This video really meant a lot to me just to hear the input of someone I love so much! I hope you are doing well, and godspeed."
"Beautiful. Is that a top or dress? Designer?"
"glad to see you back, you look amazing and beautiful. XX"
"I honestly didn't think you needed to look any more feminine - but I haven't spent 60 hours a week looking at your face.  I guess working in front of a screen/mirror/behind a camera might make you more focused on your looks. If I started using makeup to look perfect on a regular basis, it would probably completely ruin my self-worth, and I would probably end up wanting to make permament changes to my face to hide my imaginary (or real) imperfections. I already have that problem with physical excercise, wanting to improve my body and imagining what it would be like to starve myself to a point where there is no fat on my body.  I remember back in high school, I wouldn't go outside if I didn't have hair gel or wax, or just a bad hair day. Don't know if it was beauty standards or just anxiety. Wanting to be perfect.. for some reason."
"I fucking love you!!"
"I'm going to guess that after filming this video, this is the cleanest your mirror has been in a while."
"Ok, but you DO look beautiful, I can’t lie"
"Ohhhh I see. Ya I was sorta worried when you didn’t play any new content for awhile. I’m glad your ok"
"Thank you as always Natalie for your unflinching gaze into the truth of matters"
"It is all about those millimeters of bones. But i guess you wouldn't suggest the same thing for inkels. Would also add that it isn't just about getting pussy, being attractive gets you better treatment by both men and women in this society. By the way, beauty standards are mostly biologically determined they are not a 'social construct'."
"l lemonade l l lemonade"
"I'd like more sequin asmr it was lovely"
"Yes yes yes as a women in science what you said about the rejection of femininity in academia rings so true. I wore next to no make up through my PhD, I was even afraid that wearing nail polish might mean my peers would take me less seriously. But then I said fuck it and now I wear bright red lipstick or winged eyeliner to lab every day.     Also I know you said its hard to accept the authenticity of a complement from a fan, but I do think you are beautiful."
"Before mentioning incels, you kinda normalize some of their terms.  Then you start mentioning them almost as if they're more important than they are.  Are you kinda absorbing that a bit, without meaning to?  Maybe you've been spending too much time in places like that.  It was a bit offputting during the video."

"Speaking as a cis male, I've had a lot of thoughts about myself and my own lack of beauty. So I can completely understand how when editing hours of footage of yourself can be tortuous. I've hated evrything from nose shape to size of wrists regarding my own body and my own 'lack' of beauty. Even now, when I am much better regarding myself, I do not enjoy looking at pictures of myself or even listen to my own voice.   So I understand a lot of what you are going through, and hope that life gets better with age!"
"i've missed you and i'm so glad you're back and i love you and you're beautiful and i hope you feel it more and more!"
"Literally the only thing I am not 100% on board with is the idea that women in academia who don’t put effort into their looks is mainly because of pressure to be masculine or because of some “not like other girls” bs. I’m a cis female college student (but also a lesbian so I got excused a little later in the video 😂) who doesn’t do my hair or make up, and generally just wears whatever is comfortable, but that IS actually because I don’t care. Not that I don’t care to be beautiful, I think everyone does. It is because I don’t care enough to wake up early and put the effort in (or even put the effort in to learn how to do these things in the first place). I’m also going to school for opera performance though so I do have to be feminine and beautiful a lot of the times, and whenever someone does my make up really well and puts me in a wig for a performance, it does feel really awesome, and part of me wishes I DID care enough to do that every day, but... I’m just too lazy for the most part lol. I honestly admire my woman friends who do put that effort in. I also can’t say I’d feel the same if I were trans either though, because I feel like society makes trans people have to “prove” that they are the gender they identify as, whereas everyone just accepts I’m a woman without me having to actually do anything about it.   On another note, I’ve always found you to be beautiful and very feminine, but post-surgery it is like... a different sort of femininity. Your face looks so soft and cute and pretty, kind of fairy-like ❤️  I wish you all the best in everything you do, I am so grateful for your channel and for your willingness to be open to the scum of the internet!"
"Okay as Bulgarian I just popped big time for the Bulgarian rose fields! haha"
"I think you're pretty without make-up <3"
"hey you shou- you should make a video about palestine it would be good"
"Oh dear, when you compared the pictures, I read 'FFS' as 'for fuck's sake', hahaha! :-D"
"Can confirm, I’m chilling in a thousand jackets"
"I saw it once but when the subtitles come I will see it again to actually understand it."
"Now I want plastic surgery too"
"i just want to be a big titty normie like my mom (but also lesbian), is that too much to ask?"
"That shirt 😍"
"'Because my jaw is still numb from the surgery. Love THAT !!' Although life and our minds may drag us down, we always rise again."
"you have great style and great points"
"Just because something is socially constructed, usually it stems from biological realities.. it doesn’t mean they’re completely wrong. They’re there to act as a social immune system"

"I'm heading in for my FFS tomorrow :D What a lovely video to see before <3"
"'female femenine and beautiful' i cringe so hard. I think that trying to separarte females from 'femeninity and beauty' is like one of the core goals of feminism..."
"Nutted when you pronounced van Gogh with the Dutch flemch 'G' <3"
"It wigs me out that people think you don't pass. Like holy shit how? When? Am I just bad at clocking people?"
"Great video essay as always"
"16:00 you totally missed a trick - women are competing amongst themselves for who is most beautiful. You don't need any guys around. It's about status."
"Here's an absolute truth: I had no idea who this woman is, or what she does.  I found her because my son played a video by a guy named Shaun.  The guy is pretty smart and has good ideas, so I watched more of his stuff.  On his channel, in the 'liked videos' section, was on called 'Incels', by Contrapoints.  Since I'm cooking a book about the gradual degeneration and ultimate disintegration of society as we've known it and a large part of that book will concern tribalism and factionalism as groups of people splinter away from modern lifestyles as civilization collapses, I thought 'I wonder what this hot chick thinks about this odd and rather silly subgroup of men that spend all their time hating women on-line because they can't get laid?'  I must note they're only odd and silly until one of them grabs the nearest, readily available, firearm and goes off to shoot random women.  It stops being odd and silly and turns into tragically grotesque.  But, I digress.  So, I'm watching this video, having never seen this woman before and having no idea of her work, and I wouldn't have known she was born a man until she made some reference to it.  So, if it's 'passing' that is what she's worried with, she can stop.  She had me fooled all day.  So, even though I don't like the word 'fan', because it's short for 'fanatic', I would consider myself to be one of her's.  The woman is pretty brilliant.  In fact, if I ever were to meet a woman with the vast reserves of intelligence and creativity that this one possesses, I'd probably marry her in a heartbeat.  Because this is the sort of person you could have a conversation with every day for thirty years and never have the same one twice."
"I relate so hard as a 6' blonde tranny..."
"Surgery or not, you’re a gorgeous woman. But the healing looks great and you look fab AS ALWAYS."
"EXcelente video, but the Ritual of skin care products is a masterpiece on its own, I watched it three times: 'none of these is sponsored, by the way, this is just me supporting corporations out of the kindness of my heart'"
"I don't wear makeup - I could just never be bothered ... It's the same reason I can't make a braid for the life of me. (Never spent the necessary time practicing). Even though I'd love some Daenarys level shit on my head. Honestly, though, when I've put on makeup, a lot of the time I feel ... not me. Like I'm wearing a mask. i don't like that feeling, and so that may be why I've never 'bothered'."
"Me finnishing my make up in front of my mirror: 'mmh, wow. Not bad! I actually look good! Yaas!' Takes a photo of this confidence boost of a face: '... Ugh! Who is that shebeast and what rotting swamp did she crawl out of?!?'"
"Who is in the picture? My eyes aren't registering and my brain isn't working. I'll take my answer off the air."
"*sees pikachu in x-ray* - oh, then I DID see a contra reference on /traa today"
"This is the best intro for a video I've seen on YT this year. SOPHIE is GOAT."
"i wish i was straight chillin"
"I can't believe Natalie just cancelled the whole Beauty Industrial Complex"
"Great surgery! You can tell something was done but not quite what. Well, until you go into gruesome detail. 😊 Get out of my room mom!"
"<3  I peeped that Fenty Beauty Foundation we stan!"
"Im currently studying abroad in Germany but I'm originally from Baltimore. Im also trans, and normally at home in the US wear make up at least everyday (normally just foundation and concealer). However since being here for 3 months Ive almost never wear make up. Some of this may have to do with the hippier aspects of Freiburg im Breisgau and my friends who are women dont wear wakeup makeup it makes me feel more confident about myself. It also may have a lot to do with not having as much anxiety about recieving backlash as I do at home"
"these are films not videos"
"Sun is what makes your skin age!!! Slather yourself in sunscreent stat 😱"
"Sophie’s “Faceshopping” right off the bat?! I’m already losing it!"
"You know, this video could've been just as easily called 'Self-Esteem' and it probably would've fit perfectly."
"Contrapoints! You should know that it took me forever to figure out you were trans when I watched you for the first time.  You confirmed it midway through the first video I watched and I was surprised. I've dated trans people and I live in a super liberal city, where there are actually quite a few trans folk. :) I say this to explain that I'm not unfamiliar. My first impression was really just how much you reminded me of Winona Ryder. (Hope you take that as a compliment, I find her beautiful.) You are too! I wish you happiness as you explore what it means to be you. 💗"
"Love the video but found a flaw in your makeup argument. Women wearing makeup in jail proves nothing. I'm not debating what percentage Peterson was right about about makeup. I honestly don't care enough to debate it. Just that you're not factoring in instinct, and how long an instinctual act must be redundant before said act ceases. And it's certainly not within a human lifetime. Most animals augment their physical appearance to show fertility somehow. Human women use makeup. Even if men aren't around, and continued to be not around for hundreds or potentially even thousands of years, women could still continue to use makeup out of instinct. I'm watching my house cat right now freaking out because there's a bird outside. Another 10,000 years may go by of house cats not needing to hunt and they will still want to kill every bird they see. So I think for you to prove your point, we'd have to somehow isolate many generations of women in a prison for hundreds of years. But even then, the appearance fertility may become revered for other reasons. Skill on applying makeup in that case could become a symbol of dominance. A new context for female only hierarchies to form. You're basically trying to say that applying makeup is not instinctual. Every women claims she wears makeup because she 'likes it', or it 'makes me feel good'. But every single thing a human does that feels good, feels good because it has a purpose for survival and procreation. It's just really hard to swallow when every woman on earth just happens to 'like' wearing makeup and we're supposed to believe it's not instinctually driven? Also, men don't stop doing masculine things that attract females when they're in prison. So let's not forget that humans are just intelligent animals that get born, fuck, multiply and die just like every other animal. Our rituals are sill quite primal if you put them under scrutiny."
"Wow. This one hit hard. Help me out, YouTube commentators- what can I do to help my wife *feel* beautiful. I really do think she is, but I tell her a lot, and it just bounces off. It's not helping. Consider me an utterly brainless 40 year old cis Male white dad. Let me have it, any ideas? Thoughts?"
"i know it was a short bit just at the end, but style vs beauty is SUCH a good example of 'look how YOU want yourself to look, and youll look amazing' and 'the perfect accessory for every outfit is confidence'. if you find that you enjoy and are happy about how you look, no matter how you look or what you wear, you will look good in it because it will be YOUR look. sadly building up confidence for your own style vs just doing what beauty standards want you to do has to be both an individual and societal effort. who enforces beauty standards? individual people. who makes beauty standards? society. i dont imagine this is something that will ever be resolved, but its good to surround yourself with people who can appreciate and encourage your personal style while still being objective enough to let you know when something doesnt fit you. not what doesnt fit their vision of you, but when something doesnt fit who you are. definitely not a definitive and cut-and-dry topic to discuss, but VERY important for people to try to understand and be aware of. ❤"
"Hit of dopamine for you, I find you absolutely gorgeous. I also love your incredibly intelligent and well made videos and I always feel like I learn and get new subjects to think about from them. Thank you."
"I felt this to my core, artistically, emotionally, and philosophically. I'm so happy for you! Here's to a speedy recovery, Natalie!  💙💜💙💜💙"
"It's so nice to be here. Brain and beauty. You are so beautiful! I understand and follow you. If my brain stops summing I will think about this. 🥰"
"In one of Edward Weston's Daybooks, he wrote at some length about retouching a portrait of a client with a pencil (it was the '30s or so, so PencilShop?). They wanted even smoother skin and he had to keep going."
"Who was your doctor, just curious?"
"I'm gonna need a 40 minute video of you tapping and running your nails along that sequin dress. Thanks."
"I'm a cis guy, and goddamit, now i want to wear 6000 sequins, no joke.  EDIT: And now that I've actually watched the video, I have to say I think you hit the jackpot when it comes to beauty and style, as well as how important they are and how much control we have over the two of them. I admit, I came into the video on the side of 'what is this shallow BULLSHIT?!?!?!?!?1', but damn, I guess I never really saw things the way you do (again, cis dude here).  Also, and I know this is me becoming part of the problem again, but you look REALLY good without makeup. Just saying."
"That jumper is fabulous I want it!"
"You are so great!"
"SOPHIE!!"
"That production on that intro made me hard"
"I don't know where one gets a sequinned shirt like that one but I need three."
"Great vid as always. Must confess i saw you as attractive even before you decided to transition."
"Natalie is better Gaspar Noe than the actual Gaspar Noe"
"She was gone Now she bacc Most importantly  She look like a snacc!!"
"Gay Italian girl here talking. You already did pass. So sorry for the unintentionally hideous comments."
"Can you eventually write a book about skulls? You always have such an interesting perspective on it."
"Hi Natalie. You were always beautiful but now WOW.  Love and luck to all from a manly dysphoric Louise in Wales Uk."
"You look amazing! Absolutely love the amount of work and talent you put into your videos 💕"
"I love the take on 'Gymnopedie No. 1' at the end!"
"14:30 I'm totally down with the 5 pounds of makeup look."
"congrats on getting a couture Stacy circumference."
"you know that sunscreen is the only medicaly proven any aging cream?"
"well you look good...suggested next step...the V jay jay"
"Thank you for discussing this. This is the exact internal dialog I've been having. I've tried so hard to be frank about my insecurities to like-minded friends and no matter how much my insecurities are validated, it never goes away. It's to the point that I've decided that i will get plastic surgery in the hopes that it calms down that inner critic. But your bit about your getting plastic surgery and still not feeling pretty enough... That's real. It'll happen to me, I'm certain.  Yes, Natalie. You do have a female brain. Welcome to Womanity."
"Celine Dion"
"Don't know how but you managed to became even more gorgeous than before."
"Only Contra could successfully mix SOPHIE and Erik Satie"
"Wow ok no one told me that I’d be watching American Horror Story when I clicked this video"
"As a cis gender female who was in a PhD program, my own reason for usually not wearing makeup has nothing to do with appearing less feminine. Mostly it is because makeup takes a lot of effort. But also I actually don't wear makeup because of vanity. Every time I wear eye makeup I have to wash it off. And the washing causes some of my real, naturally long and dark eyelashes to fall out. Every time I wear concealer I risk it causing me to break out the next day."
"Best video yet."
"if you get your brow ridge reduced are your headbutts less powerful"
"Gurl get on that Tretinoin train already."
"You look beautiful and always have. Thank you for sharing about your journey. I really appreciate your channel. You've helped me have a better understanding about trans ppl and trans issues."
"Storytime: *makes an entire artistic production that could be used in a gender studies course*"
"The 'shouldn't beauty be fun' connected to me on a spiritual level. When I do makeup that's supposed to be pretty I always feel like a fraud even though I'm born female. Putting on the makeup is fun cause it's artestry but then I have to take it off otherwise it'll drive me insane/into depression"
"never skip sunscreen queen"
"As a Dutch speaker I love you for saying van GoGGGGHHH"
"I think you're beautiful"

"Does that wonderful shirt come in 500lb fat guy? I want one."
"why am i never used to these videos. they just throw me off every time."

"Do the evolution baby 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👸🏼💓"
"we do need a contrapoints."
"Thank you so much for posting this! You brought up a lot of topics that have been on my mind these days as my career brings me further into the spotlight of the world."
"Yooo she looks amazing wtf I never would have know she'd had surgery if I didn't see the before and after side by side, it's so natural looking, I was bamboozled goddamn"
"So glad to see you back, I had started to worry... I needed my ContraFix. Another great video! I love your take on most things whether I 100% agree or not. No flattery, honestly, I think you look great. I didn't think you looked bad before, I really thought you were pretty. Just keep coming with the great content I really do appreciate it. Yes, we do need ContraPoints saying leftist, challenging gender stuff and other stuff... you know, do what you do."
"Been having a terrible month too and really needed this.  Thanks for another great video. <3"
"Ahhhh once again you prove your self a superlative creator, discussor, and editor! Seriously your videos each bring such new light and views to issues, great work as always!"
"I get she doesn't feel beautiful but it's also pretty fucking laughable considering I have to go back and rewatch every few minutes because I space out while staring at her gorgeous face lmao"
"you know one of the biggest things about figuring out i'm trans is that i can finally find a style that fits me."
"When you smile or laugh about your own jokes you look really cute. Like that genuine expression that hasn't changed one bit since you started your channel is so lovely."
"Natalie, you're no 6. You're a 10. Inside and out. ❤️"
"How dare you post this when I'm in the midst of hating myself. RUDE."
"usage of 'leftist' rather than 'postmodernist'"
"Thank you! Thank you girl! This means sooo much to me. Growing up in a college town around the Birkenstock mafia to navigating the business world ...its such a tightrope. Not just externally...but internally. I so want  to be beautiful but I hate myself for it.   Thank you for making me feel less alone. Also, you are insanely gorgeous...💕"

"sophie intro music, greatest crossover"
"don’t worry lesbians are suffering too xoxo"
"this was really goddamn good"
"I’m a black woman and I don’t really strive to look beautiful. What is said to be beautiful in the media only touches a tiny fraction of the world population. I think there are better odds to cure cancer than be found beautiful by universal standards. The aim these days is to present a clean, elegant and stylish self, it indeed includes make up but in a conceal/enhance natural way with a bit of whimsy depending on the occasion. Finally I above all use make up to match how I feel inside to the outside. Even the happiest person with dark circles and acne will look tired and terrible on a smiling picture. I’m my true self when my face is made up to remove those distractions."
"Damn that Gymnopedie remix is a banger"
"Natalie was and is hot. Periodt. Thanks for edumacating the youths"
"genius!!!!!"
"Which yeast active are you using?I havent found one in a spray bottle. Btw do you use eye cream?"
"Words that you need to hear:  You made the right choice.  You are beautiful inside out.  You as smart as heck, you thought everything trough, you made the right choice. I am amazed by your transformation into your true self.  This all sounds pathetic and cliche but these are facts. Care about you in a weird way, so I had to say this, lol.  ❤️"

"The ultimate antidote to the alt right infection."
"The changes you made really suit you Natalie. Ya look great!"
"Honestly I think you were perfectly passing and good looking before but if you feel better now I'm supporting you all the way. You do you girl"
"i figured that perhaps it was not the best idea to watch this while eating when Skull Lady started painting quite a vivid image of it. but honestly, kiki aside, you are my ultimate girl crush. there is not one video of yours that isn't superbly produced, hilarious, incredibly well written and thought provoking. wishing you a swift recovery! <3"
"Sequins. Roxxxy Andrews is triggered."

"my face is the front of shopuh....... 💃🏻👯👁️👄👁️"
"Natalie, you are too hard on yourself, and I know you know that. You continue to blow us away with your wit and charm, and yes, beauty. It makes my day when you post a video. Please don't go anywhere, the world DOES need Contrapoints. Congrats on a successful surgery, continue living your best life and be kind to yourself and others <3"
"You made me cry thanks mom"
"Hey, can I ask why it's not okay for people to say that you wanting ffs is internalized transphobia, but it IS okay for you to say that women in academia not wearing makeup is internalized misogyny? That kind of hit a nerve with me and I don't think you really thought that through as much as you could have.   I don't judge anyone else for wearing makeup and I certainly don't do anything to be 'not like other girls' because girls are awesome no matter how they present themselves, I just don't have the desire to do it myself. And even if I did I don't have the energy or the money, which I'm sure almost everyone in academia can relate to. Maybe it's because I'm bi and nb but Idk? Even on my prettiest, femmiest days I just don't like putting on makeup."
"BIOLOGICALLY FEMALE BRAIN HAHAH. ABSOLUTE MADNESS"
"Intellectual icon 🙌📸🧠"
"Ah shit. As I heard about a surgery, I thought I could finally say what I've been holding onto since the Incel video. Just you wait. Congrats anyway. You look great. I hope it's not a downer if I say you looked great before too. I particularly want to congratulate you on not overdoing it, like getting a standard-model nose out of a catalog. Your face still has character, which so many women destroy by chasing ideals. If you're considering doing something more: don't. Boy am I glad I don't have to deal with shit like dysphoria or having my appearance made an issue (by others or me). Cis is bliss I guess, at least in this regard."
"Honestly, you look perfectly okay to me."
"Hey, i don't want to sound shallow or anything but somehow you've gotten even prettier than before???!!! Honestly you're kindof my standard of femal beauty to be honest. Also just saying, you're pretty much my role model and i really hope you have a nice day =)"
"Why is there Minecraft music in the outro?"
"Mental illness is confusing."
"14:33 'No makeup---Looks diseased' XD"
"when she said, 'it's hard being a 6'...i felt that"
"Lol ”wanna feel beautiful” “express femininity/individualIty”. Yes, in order to breed, i.e. attract men. You’re an animal like the rest of us, deal with it."
"The make up part gave me 'american psycho ' flashbacks. Even though all I remember from that scene was that 'alcohol in some products dries the skin and makes you look older '"
"I always feel bad for women because they genuinely care about their appearance, while men are encouraged not to do so. Sometimes I catch myself caring a little bit, but I can always fall back on, 'meh, i'm a dude. give me all of your ice cream so i can eat it.' Anyways Natalie I think you look cute and you seem to care about that so I'm happy for you."
"You are simply not beautiful. Deal with it, or get more plastic surgery (a lot more)."
"I'm not one of those people who keeps things to myself when they're not nice to say,  but there's an exception when it comes to looks.  I don't lie about what I think about looks, though.    So, knowing this, I hope this bitch feels better when I tell her that I totally wanna smash and this bitch is passable af."
"SOPHIE!"
"without makeup Natalie looks like she could be my therapist's sister and idk how to feel abt that"
"how you call someone thats makes videos << a cam girl>> lol so hard with that serious face he delivered the line"
"Cis/white/hetero male here: Anyone who says that they don't care AT ALL about being perceived as attractive is either lying or on such a different mental plane from the rest of us that I don't even know what to think about them. I'd be shocked if even the asexual folks are even really in that camp.  PS: plastic surgery is a weird term (You do look great though!)"
"For how casually people talk about it, it easy to forget that plastic surgery is... Surgery. Cuts and anaesthesia and blood and bandages"
"One unanswered question:  Did you get BOOBIES too? :D"
"I had always thought you are gorgeous in all your phases as a being. ♥"

"Your dress is beautiful and your face is beautiful. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"
"K, but I would die for you. Choke me mommy 💋"
"Eh, I don't do a lot of make up stuff because it's hard and expensive. If I can give up on physics and geometry, I can bloody well give up on understanding how make up works! (... I actually took an interest recently but only because sometimes I want to present as a man at least at home, so countouring and shit).   Also as a queer cis woman I feel less pressure in everyday life, since the first thing you learn is that you can go from butch to lipstick whenever and that's fine. Or maybe I just don't notice the pressure because I'm obvious as fuck."
"''maybe lesbians are chilling'' I spat out my drink XD FFS. This was so on point"
"'I guess I'm stuck with' That's why I like your essays conclusions Miss CounterPoints,  they are both generally correct and generally dirty."
"shit, she didn't ask me about the make up. does that mean i'm not straight?"
"25:30 - I disagree, society has been changing on the opinion of what is beautiful. As negative biases have declined, conventional concepts of beauty are being expanded, too rapidly actually for some. About fatness I'm not so sure, even being too skinny was fiercely criticized in the 90's. Unhealthiness is never beautiful by most people's standards."
"This IS style. This IS art. You ARE a special kind of asthetic."
"You look like a completely different person. This reminds me of when they put the new aunt vib on the fresh prince of bellar. Like what the fuck? It's like annoying guest star on your favorite show, but it's still you."
"'Maybe lesbians are just straight up chilling'  No , we're worrying about the extinction of the bees"
"If I weren't broke and living in a third world country I would for shure donate and be your patreon, never before have I seriously considered such a possibility! your content is awesome! <3"
"Your results look great! I disagree that 'smart people' don't care what they look like; the smart ones know there is a need to code switch depending on the social context. I don't wear makeup, shave, etc. at home; however, I know that in order to get a job or be taken seriously, I have to 'femme' it up A LOT in order to achieve the outcomes I need to survive. Cocky people (who believe they are smarter than everyone) don't code switch and then get angry when societal expectations prevent them from progressing. As a lesbian, I'd love it if looks didn't persuade outcomes, but we aren't identical blind grey alien blobs and we aren't that progressive to resist judgments based on looks; so take some pride and care into how you look to achieve your goals. It's hard as a not-so-feminine lesbian who also doesn't pull off the masculine swag (lol) type look. I find myself rarely feeling 'pretty', about once a month too. I don't think I'm ugly often either though, just some weird limbo version of okay. My wife, who nearly everyone including myself says is insanely beautiful, thinks she's hideous. This topic was a very good choice for a video and warrants further exploring, especially with LGBT identities. Thank you!"
"You're looking like a young Celine Dion these days."
"i love her humor ,she's so funny  hahahahah"
"Not one of the more interesting topics you've covered IMO but enjoyable video nonetheless. Production value is on point."
"I live in a society"
"PUT ON THE SUNSCREEN NAT!!"
"What would the world be like if mirrors stopped working?"
"Please Natalie. Photosensitivity warnings."
"Not just saying it... you look very pretty, and actually kinda Hot, and you can't really tell that you're a trans woman, anymore.  And this comes from an old straight dude, who is NOT a big fan of your Progressive BS.  I mostly watch you so I can get some different prospectives on my own beliefs and ideas... also, you crack me up... and your videos have above average production value."
"I definitely agree that not all gender dysphoria is in a vacuum! I dealt with realizations that a lot of my chest dysphoria was bc I felt I 'had' to want to remove my breasts to 'prove' I was nonbinary. But why does breastlessness indicate I don't have a binary gender? It doesn't. But because I'm read as female I'm expected to change the things people see as inherently feminine. And if I don't I'm a liar.  It's just bags of fat. Why does that need to be gendered? So I still feel some dysphoria sometimes, bc I sort of trained my brain to. But I decided I don't need to change my body to be my gender. Not saying that any trans person needs to choose what I did. Just saying my experience and choices."
"I am so glad you're back!!  (And I love that sequin top so much where do I get it??)"
"Those sequins <3 I cannot tell you how gorgeous I think you are without sounding either creepy or insincere. Just take my word for it."

They tell me that's not a real woman, and something is wrong with her. Meh."

I ostensibly don't care about beauty that much, in that I don't often feel pressured to wear makeup but do wear it when I start a new job or just when I want to feel 'prettified' or whatever. It is like you said a stylistic choice.  Like those women you mentioned in academia I derive much more of my self worth from my personal efficiency and academic achievements, and you're so right that you can feel COGNITIVELY that your participation in a capitalist system does NOT determine your self worth, but still FEEL like shit when getting a promotion and having excellent grades don't give you the sense of fulfillment you crave.

I’ve ALWAYS found tall woman irresistible, and I usually approach them from behind. I like it when women use their long, sensuous necks to turn around and acknowledge my approach.  HOT SHIT!!  Anyway, men can be blind to details when they see what REALLY turns them on walking by. While meeting me might be par for the course with YOU, I’d have to consider my notions, as a cis male who likes cis females, of what a woman is to me, REALLY.

"Hey, fellow trans girl who transitioned in her 20's here. I love this vid. A difference between you and Gigi is that i've watched several of her videos and never subscribed, but i subscribed to you after watching all of this 1 video. I never wear makeup, but i do a ton of skincare, and so my aesthetic is black glasses, black snake bites, pale clear skin, and bold eyebrows. It works for me, lol, but i definitely still compare myself to every fucking girl ever. Sigh.   Thanks for making this video, btw."
"I've always thought the term 'reconstructive surgery' used in the context of SRS and FFS was misleading.  I had a conversation with another well known trans youtuber about the use of the term, and she argued that FFS was reconstructing what testosterone took away from her. My counter arguments is that A: you don't know what you would have looked like as an adult had you been a cis woman, and B; then people who have plastic surgery/procedures to take away signs of aging are also having reconstructive surgery/procedure to reconstruct what time took away from them. But we openly and rightly so call bullshit on the latter misuse of the term. And it's not like people who get FFS are interested in looking like ugly women either, they want to be beautiful women (if you're going under the knife, might as well). So this isn't about looking more feminine or passing more, this also just about looking more beautiful. So let's just call a spade a spade and not use the 'reconstructive' term. I think that applies more to people who have been in accidents or who have been the victim of violent assault, for example a person who had half their face melted off is now getting reconstructive surgery to make their face look more like what they used to look like before the incident.   I'm pretty we can find a different term to fill in onto insurance forms that gives people financial assistence with FFS."
"The algorithm proposed your video to me about incels. I hadn't seen anything from you yet, and until you mentioned that you were trans, I didn't think about it. I'm a trans man myself and have quite some references of how trans women can look. So that was before your ffs (for fucks sake) surgery, and now you look good, again! You used to look more like a cis women I know. I saw her nose as a defining characteristic. I have never heard anyone call her 'masculine' nor thought of that myself. Anyways you can of course not take my comment seriously because I look like a trans masc twink, but I don't 'yasss queen' every time I see someone doing something femme."

"This is in a way very relatable to me as an AFAB nb person- femaleness, femininity, and beauty are in fact so woven together that it’s nigh impossible to separate them. Can I feel beautiful without feeling feminine? If I DO feel feminine does that make me more female? Can I feel “pretty” without feeling like a cis girl who’s faking it all? It’s hard to have a healthy relationship with womanhood, even more so when your experience with womanhood isn’t “typical” (in this case being a cis woman who has never questioned her gender identity).  Side note, LOVE your shirt"

"I haven't finished the video yet (23:00) but I just have to tell you something:  YOU'VE BEEN LIED   What about? About the importance of beauty! It is just as important as anything else, just as important as any other personal characteristic. It is in our nature, everyone's nature. We want to be succesful, be recognised by others and feel good, and that's FINE! Fitness, health, beauty, apparel... all those things indicate good genes, wealth, good habits, good life, even the intelligence to overcome other shortoffs during your lifetime.   E.g., if you are unlucky and you're propense towards obesity, a strong will and proper knowledge can get you out of it in most cases. In your case, hard work and surgical procedures. And that's fine!   But the thing is that you only hear people screaming that beauty is superficial, it is unimportant... But that's fake. Those people either are not sensitive to aesthetics, are not beautiful or they just try to get rid of competition... either conciuosly or not. The people who are beautiful are so deep inside their own 'first class beauty people' problems that they don't have time or need to complain about it.   So, TL;DR: Everything is important. Don't be obsessed on just one single aspect of your personal characteristics. Do something to be the best version of yourself, try to feel good with yourself, and do it in a relaxed manner. And just live, eat and have fun ;)"

"Ahem. At first, being a 900% cis male who's added many vaginas to my coonskin belt over the decades, I figured my rating you on looks would prompt some valuable discourse; however,  after OED-ing the term 'parasocial,' I've decided instead to commit suicide by cop at a local Panera."
"Honestly, as a non binary person, beauty isn't an option for me which was pretty crushing and devisating when I realized. I found refuge if the punk movement and it's aesthetics. I was never gonna be beautiful so I dressed in a way which was never trying beautiful. I grew up a little and although I'm still young I'm less punk that I was and cultivating style was how I sought out of the spiral myself. Obvious dysphoria and society still gets me real down sometimes and I even had an ed for a while because of it, but finding a subculture that was about rejecting beauty and going for the opposite of beauty really helped me accept that beauty wasn't an option, and that I would survive and maybe even flourish without being beautiful."
"I appreciate the discussion on whether FFS is cosmetic surgery or corrective surgery, as well as the difference between choosing to pursue to look more female versus more feminine.  I underwent FFS some ... umm ... thirteen years ago?  I was living semi-stealth in Northampton at the time, a super queer town. I say semi because it was never intentional so much as people in super queer Northampton just assumed that the masculine person with boobs was either a butch lesbian or a trans man, not a crowdagger who just happened to be 'taught womanhood' by some kind butches in a North Hollywood bar.  Oh the irony.  Having FFS brought me out of that closet because people recognized some of the bruising and assumed I had undergone a cosmetic face lift. 23 year old me was afraid of being seen as vain so I quicky admitted to having undergone FFS (which I saw as a corrective procedure for me) rather than let folk see mas someone who wanted to look younger in my twenties.  Trans woman removing bone to look like she was born less male? SURE!  Someone who would go under the knife for mere vanity...? UNTHINKABLE!  Clearly, 23 year old me had a lot going on in their head."
"Para social relationship aside, I would d**k you down the moment I was given consent. Of course I'm biased by my attraction to intelligent women and tall women. I'm on record of saying that if i ever meet a woman who is taller than me, I don't have a choice, I gotta marry her. (I'm 6'6' so take that for what you will.) But the important thing being this, you pass, like actually pass, if I was never told you were a transwoman, I would have thought you were cis. On top of passing, you are a gorgeous woman. Now with that said, you're right, the world needs ContraPoints, but we also need you Natalie. So don't stop being you."
"If it helps at all to say, you're prettier than the average girl* (this is probably because your makeup game is so very on point), and are passing really well, especially when you're without your makeup. When you are, you look a lot like a prettier version of my cis-female cousin. The resemblance is kinda freaking me out. And referencing Hunter S. Thompson? You're amazing. *And this is from a guy who loves average girls. Ya'll are awesome."
"Well... the few mm of bone does have the result of... surprisingly looking... well - female.  Not that looks are the deciding factor of who is female.  You already were female to me but this is surely more effeminate in actual structure, if one looks at the average of female faces.  Looks highly typical.  :)  Well worth the investment if one can afford it."

"As someone from an Asian background I can confirm it's not as simple as 'western standards' of beauty for double eyelid surgery. Double eyelids naturally occur in most Asian countries I know of, just not very frequently. To assume it's influence from the west is assuming Asians aren't self-aware of their own decisions."
"You may be a woman Natalie. But you still Da Man. x"
"Even as a cis biological female, I still don't feel female presenting because of the new trends of femininity. And my mental health has taken a blow because of it, I'm starting to have gender diaphoretic episodes cause I don't think I'm feminine enough to be female so 'I must be something else', it's been such a confusing and terrifying experience. This video helped me so so so much. Thank you for this ❤️"
"gay or gamer sent me off"
"To counteract the phones issue, I recommend looking at your face and body everyday and consciously thinking about what you like about it. Just as you can train yourself to spot perceived flaws, you can train yourself to focus on what you like about yourself too. Maybe you don’t like much at first but just trying to focus on what you like will make it easier over time. I discovered this worked for me years ago after watching that viral video “To This Day” by Shane Koyczan. The poem resonated with me and I took its advice seriously and it helped me. Maybe it’s not ideal for everyone but I do recommend it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltun92DfnPY&app=desktop  Also, when you’re a woman, and you may have noticed this, a lot of other women in your life can passive aggressively compliment you. I guess you’d call it negging but with no ulterior motive but to make someone feel like crap. My “friends” growing up used to say things like “I’m so insecure about my weight and what I wear. I wish I had your confidence to just not care how I dressed or what I looked like. I’m so jealous.” Like, gee, thanks I guess. It’s more subtle as an adult but that issue of “complements” that aren’t particularly nice is still there. Don’t let that get in your head if you experience either.   Those are my two bits of unsolicited advice."

MAKEUP. TUTORIAL.)

"i just wanted to say, you look amazing. like genuinely wow. your eyes have always been extremely feminine, and your proportions are extremely feminine now and before your surgery. you’re genuinely beautiful and i wish i looked like you!"
"If only I could manage my own style. Alas, sadly, acne gets in the way. In all seriousness, my personal standards of my own beauty baffle me sometimes - and I say this as a cishet guy who's not supposed to be as fussed about all that stuff. I can't tell how much of my desire to look good is to attract, or to just feel comfortable with myself. And, finding men repulsive, I can't feel I can give an accurate representation of how attractive I actually am, because, well, I'm a man and therefore aren't attractive at all. All things considered, my virility would probably be held in higher regard if I let my facial hair grow. It's growth is not overly patchy, and would probably mature into a proper beard (though with a little too much concentration on the neck) if I let it grow out, but in spite of this perceived benefit, I don't do that, because I really hate facial hair, and hate how it looks and feels on me."

"Dancing Detective Pikachu is also constantly going through my head. What a mood."
"I find it so hard to relate to the struggle for 'beauty' but we all at the very least experience unwarranted backlash for simply existing in a society that thrives on pointless biases. Some of us allow it to affect us more than others. I consider myself to be beautiful, but it doesn't have anything to do with standards. I don't meet them, especially not here in Japan. It's just a simple matter of my face/body being aesthetically pleasing to my brain. It means no matter how many adverse indications I receive for not playing this game (the endless, rewardless pursuit of the unattainable), my brain still processes the face and body it sees as pleasing, and that in turn is how I see myself. I have good days and bad days, but the bad days don't count because it's irrational to allow the deviation of the 'truth' to interfere with what's constant. It sounds like it's the opposite for Natalie, and that is a true shame. She has such an incredible command of nearly every medium she touches. There is so much to her, beauty, complexity, eloquence, wit. And all of it encompasses her 'style'. It's fearsome! It's unfortunate, but inevitable that she would get caught up, but I'm glad she chose to share this nonetheless. Perspective tends to improve with age, so let it age like a fine wine!"
"this is gonna sound really weird natalie, but your frank discussions about dysphoria and beauty standards have helped me to accept my own butch/nonbinary identity a lot better. i had a phase of desperately trying to act feminine or present myself as female, and i would think of the times where people thought i looked masculine in public as just flukes (i'm 6'1' and broad-shouldered in spite of being AFAB) and try to ignore that i felt more comfortable when people did that. your videos helped to remind me that it's okay to change my mind on things and have my identity shift over time.     now i feel more comfortable than i ever have, and it's because i've embraced the fact that i'm not feminine in identity or in appearance. i've learned to emphasize the parts of myself that i like, and feel better about myself doing it. i'm not afraid of looking the way i do in public anymore. i don't try to make myself look smaller or shorten my stride or wear things that don't suit me. if you can be a public figure who puts yourself under that much scrutiny for being something other than what people say you should be, then i can at least be true to myself in my own tiny corner of the universe.    sincerely, a disabled fan who thinks you're stunning"
"HOLY SHIT YOU'RE SO GORGEOUS"
"I love this video and I'll watch it again, but it also hurts so much. I came here searching responses and all I had were questions. And that's why I always watch your videos, Natalie, becouse you bring all the topics that matter to me and you bring a lot of questions and ideas with you.   As you, I like looking beautiful and it's something that matters to me. But I also don't want to obsess with it becouse I know I won't ever reach 'the skull I want to be'. As you said at the end of the video, style is something to consider here, and also something that I THOUGHT TOO BEFORE THIS VIDEO (not all of my ideas come from you, mom, I have my OWN mind) and it's something that I'm trying to reach, while I know that it will be the hell out of work. But it's a process that I enjoy.   So, what I wanted to say is that I appreciate this videos. The topics are great and I like hearing these thoughts and questions. But I also would love to see some answers and hope. Not only becouse it's what I need to gain strength to fight, but also becouse I want it for other people, including you.   (also, sorry for the bad english, but it's not my first language and I don't want to read this comment another time. It's too long)"
"14:00 Jordan 'its so complicated' Peterson"
"I relate to this video in kind of the opposite way. I'm a lesbian, so I wear flannel, haven't work a dress in 3 years, short hair, don't shave my legs, etc. Yet part of me always says to myself, 'The reason you dislike being feminine is because of harmful stereotypes about femininity. You're so stereotypical, you're fitting into all of society's standards!' I look at my hairy legs and think 'That's disgusting, ew' but also 'If you shave your legs, you'll just be another girl.' It's as if my brain is constantly fighting how to start the social revolution by myself. Like ffs, I just want to exist without thinking of repercussions for a second."
"This lesbian is not straight chillin, if it helps. I'm often torn between feeling like makeup is too much effort and feeling ugly or like some weird unfemale monster. You look amazing,  and that pink/teal eye combo gives me all the good 80s feels."

But still, when I see how masculine my face and body are (im not trans though, my mothers side of the family is just very masculine) I just dont want to be in this ugly body. If I wear clothes, you cant tell that my body looks gross, so its not about other people. I just dont like thinking of myself as ugly. It makes me feel like a freakish monster on the inside, like Im a weird ugly freakish creature pretending to  be human. and it makes me feel like a monster no matter what I do. Even if im sitting in a chair at work, I instinctively try yo minimize the physical space I take up and try to not move very much so people dont notice me. Theres not much I can do about the way I look. I cant make myself shorter, I cant make my shoulders less broad, I cant reconstruct my entire face shape. Im getting a nose job, so that might help a little."
"You are young and beautiful, you absolutely 'pass' (not that it should matter but... Ehh. Humans, right?), and with those boxes checked, you can continue being so many other things to so many other people, whether connected to your level of 'feminisation' or not or both. Thanks for keeping it all up, Natalie - you're absolutely heroic"
"You look so different, yet so... the same? It’s incredible. Great video, as always, and I’m way happy for you!"
"I mean, if it's any consolation (and it probably shouldn't be), I saw your videos recommended to me for a long time before I watched one, and I assumed from screencaps that you were a biological girl who was, yes, pretty."
"I think the reason a lot of men think women who aren't wearing makeup look tired, sick or whatever is probably because makeup will make someone look awake and healthy 100% of the time and when you're so used to seeing someone like that the minute the stop wearing makeup they don't look healthy and awake all of a sudden because like most adults they're stressed and tired."
"Who was your surgeon? they did a great job, very subtle."
"Hooooold up. Can you really not (edit: conceive) of cis women in academia who don't put on make up simply because they don't want to? Not for finding it 'frivolous' or from a 'scoff'-y perspective? Because I didn't hear that as one of the options. I am severely disappointed, unless I missed something."
"Detective Pikachu is definitely something I think about; especially when I'm stuck in boring ass meetings."
"ilysm"
"I figure we look the way we want. I don't get the Bad Feels from my voice (which is a good thing, 'cause it ain't going anywhere) or my downstairs affairs, but my general body shape, jawline and hair do bother me a lot. I wouldn't mind being able to change one or two of them.  I do think we should be comfortable with changing the norms of 'feminine beauty' (that's what I thought you had trouble communicating in the video you did a while back that triggered the big controversy), but we should also get that people can look how they want, especially if they don't care to put up their own bodies as fodder for the Beauty Norms War.  I think the point of critiquing the norms of beauty is to get the *looker* to change their view, not the *person being looked at*. I've become a lot more flexible about how I see people as 'beautiful', personally, because I was persuaded to examine why I find certain looks attractive and I started to realize that there's beauty to be found in people who don't look like Barbie and Ken.  in other words we have to draft laws to force people to date trans women pass it on"

"I can't believe Natalie invented beauty. We Stan 💕"
"i think perhaps there is a lot deeper reasons for women’s desire to be “beautiful” that goes deep into the social roles and expectations of men and women that you’re missing, just like women miss a lot of the layers of being trans. it’s hard to grow up that way."
"'choke me mommy' I've actually heard college students say that to each other. Damn..."
"It is true the lesbians (most of them) are just chilling. I care about beauty but like..only if girls find me beautiful. And most of the time they find me pretty without makeup so I only ever put on makeup for fun. I do have a skincare regime but it's pretty light and doesn't involve expensive mists. My gf is trans and has tried to learn makeup but has given up at this point and I support her in that she doesn't need it. We're lesbians we're all about subverting gender roles."
"the house"
"first time commenting on youtube. there are already 6k comments, so this will probably get burried, but i want to say it anyways. my friends often say that i am pretty or that i am cute. i dont know if i believe them. i take the compliments when i get them, but i deflect, or change the subject. i have never asked anyone if i pass because i have been afraid of the answer.  the other day, a girl who i had never met before started a conversation with me in a restaurant. she complimented my earings, and called me cute. i didnt believe her. then she tried to recruit me for a TERF organization. suddenly, i knew that i had passed, and surprisingly, i now believed her earlier compliments.  but why is it that i assume my friends lie to me, while assuming that a fucking TERF was honest? and that question unnerves me. and the answer scares me."

"I could totally see Chad Glow being one of those billion dollar ideas."
"I love your videos, but before I click on one of them I have to take a deep breath and prepare for a heavy dysphoria episode of my own. No contrapoints without a bottle of wine near me!"
"Well shit... Apparently I’m watching cam-girls on Youtube. What have I done with my life?"
"The eyes!  So large, liquid and LUMINOUS.  I'm sorry Natalie, yes, I watched the entire video, but was distracted all the way through by your humid, brobdingnagian foudroyant occular orbs.  What were you saying?"
"I like Zoë Blade's arrangement of Satie. :-)"

"New Contrapoints: YAY YES! I hope Natalie is doing well after surgery! *watches* *wants to hug Natalie for DAYS*"
"Natalie, has your surgical procedures affected the mouthfeel?"
"Yeah, being a professor at CUNY, most women around here seem to mute or otherwise not use make up."
"I've been with you since before you transitioned.  You look hotaf these days.  Keep up the excellent work, Natalie!"
"Be it top surgery or FFS most trans people feel depressed in the recovery"
"Honestly kinda selfishly disappointed right now about the FFS. Like I always looked to Contra as a goal of where I could get to without FFS and still look good and maybe be satisfied with how I look, but now I kinda feel like if that wasn't good enough for Contra, then it won't be good enough for me either, and now it's like I'm even further behind the curve, ya know? Please don't take this in a negative way or as if I feel like you owe me anything though Contra, like ultimately my biggest complaint here is how fucking fantastic you look, just kinda voicing out some thoughts on dysphoria and such here."
"Considering I’ll put on a full face of makeup everyday, even when I’m all alone in my house, it’s hard to reconcile that with the idea that women wear makeup for men"
"For real. You are sooo pretty to me. Just stumbled into your channel. Love the intro. So creative."
"3 hours of ContraPoints talking to Joe Rogan is a show I would watch."
"Watching this as I'm in the waiting room for top surgery hell yeah"
"Interesting, but incorrect, beauty is natural and objective, there is no 'privilege', some people are more beautiful than others and that make them better, it suck but is the right thing. Female beauty matters because biology, able people are more worthy because they are also more useful. Some things are just natural and good, and just because you are in the losing end that doesn't mean that is unfair. You study filosofy, you should ken this."
"Oh btw, the Missus wrote the FFS on the taxes. It doesn't tend to do much, other than provide you a slightly larger refund. Examples, 6 K back instead of 2K back. You should definitely still write it off anyway, as every dollar helps."
"You're at least a 6.5, sweety."

"I only look good in my microwave glass and hard light. Your style aesthetic is always on point, and though I am a married man, I can say you are beautiful, for a skinny white girl. Like top 3 out of those women.👍"
"To me, makeup is more an accessory. Yes, fundamentally it's making small alterations to your face to look better e.g. getting rid of dark circles or making your eyes look bigger, but I think makeup is more something you can use to make an outfit look more interesting or cohesive"

"bro that sophie broke me"
"i love how she's just dropping shameless hints for us to watch her other videos."
"You probably hear this all the time, but I just want to say how impressed I am every time I watch your videos, and I see you using transgender issues to explain other issues that affect so many other groups in society.  Women are pressured to choose if they want to be perceived as smart or beautiful, which is obvious and I kind of 'knew' that, but this video made me really think about the repercussions of this choice, and how unfair it is to women.  Also, when (or if) possible, add subtitles to your videos. This would allow me to share the content with people who don't speak English."
"As a straight male I get that same rush of pride feeling once every month or so when I feel like I look particularly good in the bathroom mirror."

"Can confirm, lesbians are indeed straight chillin ✔"
"I'll be completely honest here: I don't see the point in facial surgery in general. I actually think that the result looks unnatural and therefore kind of ugly...but then, I live in a country in which a lot of women don't bother to wear make-up and prefer comfortable clothes. I am sure a lot of people will now think that you are hot. But who cares about either them or mine opinion. We don't matter. The only person who matters is you. You are the one who has to feel comfortable in your own skin.   Thus said, people like you will always look beautiful. Charisma is something you can't get through surgery or make-up."
"I don't think anyone thinks they're beautiful. It's hard for a person to recognise that because of the harsh self-critic we all have. (except maybe narcissists...)"
"Hard to get past the annoying opening of the video"
"“Once you get locked into a serious skincare collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.” Oh my god Fear & Loathing, I love you"
"Phew. I wasn't sure if I should comment. I watch all of your videos but I pretty much never comment because I don't feel like any of your videos are directed *at* me since I'm a cis woman (i guess?) But this video was the first time I felt like I was being spoken to directly in some kind of way. I'm so glad you do that much introspection and critical thinking about beauty and how complex it is. I've never said anything about it before because I want to be supportive, but I can never help but feel a little bothered by the pursuit of conventional beauty like you described it. I'm fat and hairy and don't wear makeup. Not conventionally attractive. I struggle in particular with my body hair because I'm so concerned about what other people think that i'm in a constant daily battle with plucking and shaving all the hairs off my entire face and neck for fear that I'm gonna get some nasty comment and then I go straight into work where little kids grab my arm hairs and ask me why I have these and I always want to say 'I don't know! Ask my fucking parents!'   But even if I did let every hair grow out and get a nice mustache and unibrow going, nobody on the street is going to say I'm not a woman. And I know that's so unfair to trans women. But like you said, it's complicated. Everyone would acknowledge me as a woman, but not bangable or worthy of attention. I get totally ignored. I'm never harassed OR pursued by anyone. I can't even relate to all these 'universal woman experiences' like getting catcalled or having uncomfortable encounters with pushy strangers. With my minimum of face grooming and long jeans I'm just passable enough not to inspire any kind of emotion from strangers. I'm a ghost. But I'm still a woman, so isn't being fat, hairy, and yet somehow invisible also part of the 'woman experience'? It is a woman's experience, same with all cis and trans women and whatever they look like. But the 'aesthetic' of a woman as dictated by beauty standards is an entirely different thing. And I can say with certainty that it has undeniable social power."
"Killed it again. Love this video <3"
"choke me mommy ⛓😩💦👄💥"
"I think at some point it’s worth separating the want to feel good about yourself from the moving parts of your situation. Being content seems to be different and unrelated from being happy. Striving towards beauty or style is a good step towards being happy about your skin-suit but also maybe its also just nice to have a hobby you can make meaningful strides in that receive some level of recognition for. I find if I feed that desire for validation snd working on a project larger than me too much it consumes me until little things no longer bring me happiness. Cooking, making music, painting, reading fluffy fiction, or otherwise picking up less competitive lower stakes creative hobbies turned out to be the kind of stuff I needed to start doing every so often in order to be less miserable (along with going cold turkey on the negative self-talk)    I don’t know if you’ve considered therapy but there are trans-friendly therapists around these days and it’s nice to have someone to talk to that isn’t a friend but is there to help you make your life feel more sustainable and less like a goddamn marathon  Or alternatively you can do the worse thing where you do psychedelics and put yourself in increasingly compromising sexual situations"
"Me me me me me me...but what about trans people but what about trans people but what about trans people....I care about beauty I care about beauty I care about beauty I care about beauty. Why are all trans people like this?"

"Mate you could've been a fine healthy dude without having to go through any of this nonsense. You had normal heterosexual relationships. Now instead you have your skin cut off and bones chiseled off to look more feminine. You fetishized your sexual attraction to the point of getting a high from being the sexual object you so desired, that's why you try so hard to be beautiful. You reversed the roles by pretending to be the girl you always wanted to have is now you. I can imagine the same thing - if I imagine myself as a cute young girl as I get fucked by some hot guy I do get a sexual kick out of it, but I understand that's just because I like the SCENARIO - meaning I want to fuck a cute young girl, not necessarily be one. You pushed a sexual delusion so far that you're taking hormones and cutting off pieces of your skull - if this is not mental illness, then what is? Just because our modern society is a joke, one need not pretend to be in on it."
"Amazing comeback! Hits very close to home, very often."
"So Nat, - i have to say, that i can understand why you got your Facial operations, and for the most part - honestly - i like it. I prefer your old nose, but that is because i liked how you looked anyway. It if suits your needs i totally understand.  I am nonbinary, but present as a women, and i also use Makeup to accentuate my face. Not always in a feminine way, simply to push out what is generally percived as beautiful (i.e. high cheekbones, but i also make them manly, hollow) In fact, i hate subjecting to current beauty standards. As a rule of thumb, my makup consists of what i *feel* like - that is why i watch tutorials, but don't follow them. I do what i wanna do.    Generally, as a rule of thumb, i am against cosmetic surgery for any type of reason, so far so that i am literally appalled and disgusted by fake boobs and wouldn't touch them. Cosmetic surgery is one of my dealbreakers, and i struggle to see myself as an ally to the trans community because of it!  On the one side; i am also not cis, and have dismorphia (so i can relate, at least a bit.) and am pansexual.  While i came to the conclusion that i would feel 'complete' with a additional dick to my current setup (vagina, + boobs) - the Lack of dick doesn't make me *suffer* As i suffer from Borderline Personality disorder i regularly am subjected to Body Dismorphia, so i can understand the need to be beautiful and the need to be who you see yourself as, that being said: I engage with trans people through twitter a lot, and i want them to be happy and do what they wanna do, and have surgery if they decide it is necessary,  but at the same time, **it feels wrong to excluding someone on the basis of their treatment toward gender disphoria..**  I really struggle with this.. is it wrong? am i right? Is it a overreactive Dealbreaker?  Should i check my priviledge (really - no memeing or kidding) Maybe its my inherent bias that people with cosmetic surgery are too shallow, or maybe it is something else. Right now im not sure.   I am a fan of you. I love you like a friend, and sometimes i dream of you being my bigger sister. I aspire to be strong in my feminity like you are. And *dang gurrrl* your Hair got Treatment too? it is *fucking* beautiful?  Give it some time, meditate, and listen to some good music that makes your Feminity pop like your facetuned Eyeshadow.   OH and:  Refinery also showed that Women risk their lives to get Beauty products in NORTH KOREA and that beauty products are a way south korea fights back against the Kim-Regime.. they risk Torture."

In addition to not being covered by insurance I get flak from even friends and family about how it may just cause more problems to even try.  I should just accept my fate I suppose.  Fuck that though.  Trying to figure out when to schedule surgery 1 knowing that I will need several and each time is a 3 hour drive to and from the surgeon that knows how to treat Lipedema is pretty hard and I'm pretty scared of not feeling any more pretty or like I've progressed towards any kind of win scenario of 'beauty achieved.'  I'm very lucky to have a close handful of people that are very supportive.  I guess what I'm trying to say is congrats on taking another step in your journey!  I'm hekkin jealous of your beauty and super grateful that you didnt leave us fatties out of the beauty discussion."
"I’ve never heard of you but I watched this entire 30 minute video captivated. At one point I considered turning it off because I have a book I want to get back to but not only did you give some really compelling information about societal beauty standards and gender dysphasia, you also have a hilarious dry sense of humor. Also (here’s a hit of dopamine!) you’re very pretty, like wow. I wouldn’t have thought you were trans honestly. You look more feminine than I do as a cis woman 😂."
"WoW i really needed this video. I recently discovered you via a video Vice made I think. I have completely fallen in love.  I have been feeling so low and ugly. I can not believe how ashamed I am to show myself in public. I feel sorry for the people that have to look at me. I really WANT plastic surgery but I’ve always told myself that I can’t do it because it would mean giving up the fight to love myself for who I am. I still feel very conflicted. I think after this video I can kind of see that having a new nose doesn’t make me a different person. And that I’ll still feel unworthy or ugly, and the fight will go on, but at least I won’t feel like someone punched me in the gut when I see my side profile.  You have such a beautiful way of talking and educating your viewers and you are right, the world does need you.   Love from the Netherlands!!"

"Speaking as someone who's dysphoria means not looking in mirrors unless tricked into it or doing something that needs co-ordination (like a splinter in my face) and telling friends that if they take my picture be prepared to look for their phones up their butts, I really admire both your aesthetic and your willingness to deconstruct your feelings and thoughts on such - I've been jealous of how you looked years ago let alone now, I mean you have a face where on all social media I exist as an enigma and rarely go to the-outside-place"
"I thought you looked very attractive in your Genderqqueer video, but the female-skull you looks pretty cute too, your smile at 17:16 is really cute! .

"Yes @ 16:55 So I'm not crazy 😂"
"Existence is an exercise in esteem-tension for me. My instinct is to want to feel, if not necessarily naturally beautiful, then certainly naturally adequate. My bold and lofty ideal is universal adequacy.  I feel the same way about basic makeup as you do about touching up your face in photos. When I fall into the habit of wearing foundation every day, my own human face begins to look disgusting to me. I yearn for a reflection that doesn't disappoint me, but I also do want to feel actively pretty sometimes. The tension comes from an almost enraging awareness that my poor self-image comes from external sources. I only feel like my pores are huge and my eyebrows patchy because flawless airbrushed celebrities and mascara ads inundate my life with that message. And the stupid ass men who can't figure out that women do in fact have human skin are the final straw on that pile.  The double standard in daily presentation between the average pore-having man at the office, and a woman, keeps me at a low level boil. I just want to feel good enough for like, ONE SECOND. I don't want to balance getting a precious extra half hour of sleep vs. feeling like roadkill if I don't do some makeup. I bitterly stoke this coal of resentment in my heart all while jumping through the hoops anyway. It makes me feel like a bad woman AND a bad feminist. It's also one of the reasons I love bold eyeshadow and lipstick. The kinds of makeup that aren't 'stealth enhancements' are safe in my mind because they are like clothes. It's my real face, with purple and red paint on it. It's adornment, not concealment. I don't know, I guess essentially I disagree with the idea that social obsession with beauty has much to do with what reads to us as healthy per se, or with any 'natural' urges at all. Is poreless skin healthy? Are big eyelashes healthy? Adornment, now, is a well resesrched and fascinating behavior in all human societies and many animal ones. But as I established, adornment and concealment are different things. Of course, there are places where the border between the two is hazy. But overall I'd say the modern evolution of minor enhancements to the base appearance is not only different from how we've practiced adorment throughout human history, but is also fundamentally fucking with our brains. People have no idea what's normal anymore. Even knowing about it, we see 'improved' women constantly on the streets, in stores, at work. The lower bar for average keeps sliding up, and it's only ever creating more teenagers with body dysmorphia and depression every year. I don't know what to do about it and the grinding wheel torments me into pleasing it even though I perceive how flawed and unfair the system is. I just want to not feel like shit for something so fucking irrelevant to who I am as a human being."

Oh man that one's good too. Hell yeah all the colors yes that's good too LMAO"
"My nose is similar to yours pre FFS and I'm a cis woman. It's dumb how I feel self-conscious about having a nose and square jawline that just doesn't feel feminine. I'm very uncomfortable with my body hair too so when I hear that a woman has full body laser hair removal, something about that hairlessness = 'she's more of an actual woman than me' in my mind. Same goes for having a nice jawline, a small nose, a thin body, an actual ass that isn't flat, ect. I know it's dumb because that's not what makes a woman a woman, but because so many girls around me have at least one of those societal perfections, I feel like I'm under the baseline of what is considered normal. Sometimes I'll put on full makeup at home and pull my face fat tight to pretend I'm pretty. I want to see what it would look like if I were an actual girl."
"Beauty is not good for you.  I’m not happy to see Natalie keep changing , it seems self objectifying.  It would seem to be reinforcing the idea that faking it till you make it, isn’t enough by far.   I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend...  you need to stop putting yourself out there and focus on the content.  Just put on a costume and take the pressure off of yourself to look more female or whatever.    STOP trying to. Be hot.  Stop ...stop.....  I’m worried you’ve become hypocritical.  When is it enough?  Gender dysphoria is probably on a really primal level the egos attempt to be beautiful...  and maybe they are denied traditional femininity because....uh...they don’t look like Barbie or something.   Or they look kind of ‘Mannish” so they assume they can’t be beautiful EVER as a female.  And society reassured them it is true!   But it isn’t true!  And furthermore it doesn’t matter because is damaging to the individual to imply they have to change physically to be okay.   NO.  That’s NEVER a good philosophy!  Even for a woman living in todays fucked up hyper social Darwinist whatever society.  And like....smh....this is all getting out of control.  I wish I could hang out with you Nat and we could just talk.  Maybe I’m wrong but I’m worried about this self immolating pursuit for “hotness” or “beauty” if you prefer.  But we know this is about hotness not beauty...   people want to be wanted and that is their primary goal and society has taught them that it is their primary goal.  The cognitive bias is sos throng that we’re saying it’s okay to bend your self around physical adjustments and surgery and pills   ....and it sounds like a drug addiction ..... Huxley said beauty is worse than wine because it intoxicates Both the holder and beholder"
"Part of beauty is attention and power.   Its a signal to other women as well as men that you are beautiful and get lots and lots of attention.   Like you said, beauty is power. If people call it shallow and vain, they're pretty stupid.  Thing about beauty, if its your only source of validation then you're in trouble."
"Didn't expect some SOPHIE this morning, thanks for that!"
"I totally get that not feeling beautiful thing. I've cleared my skin, become more fashionable, got a rly nice haircut, wear 'natural' makeup, and guess what, still hate myself WOOP. No matter how much I get 'better' I find something new- now I have acne scars, I think more about my body, etc I'll never be happy so now I'm in therapy👌🏼"
"Absolutely looooved the intro. Dat editing! You're awesome :D"
"You look so good"
"I think the reasons I wear makeup is because it definitely helps me cope with my gender dysphoria. Thing is, I'm a trans man. Helping my body look cutesy and fun makes me feel more confident and happy. Even if I'm in the closet and can't look like myself yet I can at least have fun with what I got. I just view myself as a sexy feminine boy. And any excuse to have fun while still feeling like myself and embracing my aesthetic and personality makes me happy."

"Honestly, I don't know shit about make-up. When you wear a lot of make-up, like in this video, for instance, I think you look pretty. When you wear less, you look like just an average woman, I guess. I suppose my point is that you look fine.  You're also hilarious, and very brave to share such personal thoughts and experiences. Much respect!"

"Female grad students and professors find the idea of earnestly engaging in normative expressions of feminised beauty to be inconceivable because they masculinise themselves in male dominated fields where femininity may be undervalued and hindersome to their progress; and also because of some 'I'm not like other girls' weird flex(and this is fair enough). But you could have also pointed out that they may be doing so(or rather, not doing so) for the same reasons as the female prisoners who perform incredible feets of ingenuity and resourcefulness just to wear makeup, as a way of expressing and cultivating a uniquely female identity - things that prison takes away from them - It could be possible that these academic women in male dominated fields may be rejecting normative expressions of femininity as a way of expressing a unique female identity in fields where femininised beauty is seen as frivolous. But you could have also suggested that the reason they don't conform is because they would rather find their self-worth through cultivating kindness, intelligence, and inner beauty(this may also be what femininity means for them). I am not sure why self-expression and cultivation were good reasons for choosing to conform to heteronormative beauty standards through the expression of feminised beauty but were not also presented as good reasons for choosing not to conform."

"Lesbians are not chillin'...comng from a rather conservative country, I always had the pressure of looking 'pretty'. Sexual orientation doesn.t matter, society pressures all women (yes, not only women)."
"The word 'attractive' doesn't have to mean in a sexual sense. A well manicured lawn is more 'attractive' than an unmowed one full of weeds. It means being more comfortable around something, as opposed to finding something unpleasant. So making oneself more attractive doesn't mean you're specifically targeting a sexual partner, it means you're trying to be more pleasing-looking to everyone, including yourself. You say yourself that no amount of facts and logic and perceived injustice make you WANT to be beautiful any less, and that you need to forgive yourself for wanting to be beautiful. Why is that same forgiveness not afforded to those who, despite facts and logic and injustice, also want you (and  not just you but everyone) to be beautiful?"

"Most important thing is that you are comfortable."
"I'm at a point where my body is becoming more ~wOmAnLy~ by getting soft everywhere and creating the smallest tummy bulge. It's been jarring as I'm 25 and have been very skinny all my life. But thankfully my mother whacked me with 'the tea' and said that's just what feminine bods be doin. Still, this video is very poignant to me right now. Thanks for making and sharing all your hard work Natalie and crew."
"As a barebones generic cis brown dude who's close to being an official wizard, I give basically zero thought to beauty so this is kind of a new experience for me. In hindsight, I'd likely not be on track to be a wizard if I cared about my appearance."

I'd say if you don't pass you are getting very close to the treshold tho? Probably a subjective thing at this point. For me, removing your adam's apple is huge since this is usually where I look if I'm not sure. I can only speak for myself but as far as I'm concerned I'd say the surgery was a good decision. You definitely look more feminine now and that was your goal.  As for your appearence. I don't have any gay or bi bone in my body and I'd fuck you. You should know the implications of that statement. You are attractive to guys. All guys? No one's that attractive. But some (myself included) think you're hot. Now go get your dopamine rush by reading comments telling you how bootiful u r. I hope you appreciate good old male bluntness for a change."
"On being in pursuit of beauty and simultaneously changing society, Would you consider drag?"
"SOPHIE??? Wow taste"
"I'm a French transgirl of 2.5 years, and for me personally, having very low energy levels kind of forced me to develop a good self-image in the absence of make-up (too much effort to apply, WAY too much effort to research, buy, and resupply for). Having so little energy to devote to constructive activities is a reason why someone wouldn't wear much make-up, if at all.  I think it's very important to learn to love one's own face without make-up first. Of course, it helps to have an unconditional sense of self-worth, too. I'm aware it's not an option for everyone, I'm sorry, but a healthy 'natural' confidence is a great boost. Sure, my forehead is a little big, and I have a hair pattern that makes some people think I'm balding (I'm not, and luckily, my hairline has advanced a little), but nobody's perfect, basically. Trying to apply to ourselves the same kind of overlooking-of-flaws we apply to others is also great (having a trans girlfriend has helped me a lot with that, since we've had similar struggles).  I'm also 184 centimeters tall, and I'm pudgy, too, which is not the best combination, but I've learned to love even that. I can amuse myself with the idea that I dwarf even the average French man by 6-7 centimeters. Makes me feel like they're puny, and I'm powerful, in a way. Of course, with my body constitution, I should be toned and hardened like an amazon warrior, but I still need to work on that.   Sorry if none of that comment helped, I'm pretty rambly in general. I'm also aware that having a loving, supportive, incredibly sweet partner is a huge part of learning to love ourselves like they love us, and I know not everyone has someone like that yet, but don't give up. I used to be pretty desperate myself, and pretty fugly on top that. There's always hope somewhere."
"'That's what leftists do, we critique things...' What an appalling statement from someone claiming to be on the left. The left, the real left, not the idpol-neutered travesty it has become, did NOT just critique things. We created labor unions, organized strikes, demanded better conditions for workers and pushed for fairer representations in parliaments around the world (all of which was done first and foremost on the basis of class, and not in the name of irreconcialable identities). That's what the left did, what it's supposed to do instead of staging toothless protests about meaningless representation of marginalized groups in the American college campuses it's been more than happy to be cooped up into by capital. All of this virtous activism to be immediatley forgotten after the credentials are obtained, the privilege's been laundered and it's time to become another cog in the capitalist machine in 4 or 5 year's time. Now, that  this is what one of the 'left''s most prominent voices categorazies as the left, this marginally less docile brand of liberalism corporations are more than happy catering to, is, dare I say, problematic."

"'Too beautiful for Twitter but not enough for Instagram... its hard being  a 6'  T R U E But I think 6 is a pretty fair estimate"
"As a cis woman with body dysmorphic disorder i heavily relate to this video.  I’ve often felt the desire for surgery to feminize my features so that they might align themselves with my feminine identity; regardless of biological sex - in looking masculine despite being female, the dysphoria is still there.  I want to get surgery to alleviate the mental anguish looking in the mirror invokes in me, and trans women want the same; so is there really a difference between the motive? Is ffs truly just aesthetic vanity?  Also brings up the question of the societal implications behind the differences between body dysmorphic disorder, body dysphoria, and simply being unattractive.  I was told that in diagnosis for body dysmorphic disorder, your physical beauty doesn’t matter; its the obsession you have around it.  And yet trans women who experience these same symptoms are instead told to change themselves.... the opposite of what cis women with bdd are told (don’t get surgery because it doesn’t fix your body image, etc.).  I just find it interesting that regardless of how often the rhetoric of ‘beauty is on the inside!’ Is spread, even by mental health professionals - the standards are still reinforced, albeit unconsciously.  We will always hold on to these traditional beauty standards, and those of us who are unattractive, will always have bdd unless we lie to ourselves, or get the surgery to become beautiful.  Odd rant, but good video"
"that intro, that music. i LOVE."
"Whoo you can really act well"
"With every video I'm amazed by your beauty! You're prettier and more feminine than ever."

"'Its hard being a 6' Natalie still salty at that Dark Twisted Fantasy review from TheNeedleDrop"
"Beauty is overrated. I'm attracted to 'imperfection' (I mean something that is outside generic beauty standards) in women like a big nose and body hair <3 It's sad to think how many people are struggling with themselves even though they are probably pretty and fine."
"I VERY rarely comment on even my favorite videos. I had to express to you that I LOVE how intelligent, thoughtful, honest, insightful  and candid you are. I am so grateful for your work! Our world NEEDs Contrapoints and would be far less beautiful without you!"
"There's the idea of self love, that we should all love ourselves the way we are, but that's actually a huge amount of pressure.  It can be quite freeing to say 'I don't like how I look, I wish I looked different' and just being okay with that.  There's the pressure to BE beautiful, and also the pressure to FEEL beautiful, but screw it, I don't want to do either, it's effort!"
"this makeuproutine was too  uch for me. I'm going to save the environment now."
"I really relate to the bit where you talk about surgery not solving all one’s problems. I had top surgery a year ago and was (and still am tbh) frustrated that it didn’t immediately fix my entire life. Every trans person is on that same /journey/ to self-love and self-acceptance and god is it a long and hard road. Solidarity, Natalie. We’re all with you. ❤️"

"So glad you’re back! I was getting worried cuz you hadn’t posted in so long. Very funny and interesting video as usual. I love how honest you are with your contradictions. Aren’t we all a mess of opposing ideas? Someday I’ll be honest with myself about mine (probably not)."
"I'd say my desire for FFS is more akin to avoid the issue of what if I don't want to be goth makeup all the time."
"You are BEAUTIFUL and AMAZING."
"Liked in the first 1 second for playing SOPHIE. I love her."
"She's done it again. Wonderful video, Natalie. As a fat ciswoman, I get really hung up on beauty standards a lot, especially in the industry I'm in. I'm not particularly stylish, as I favor more classic, 'boring' wardrobe choices, and being fat makes it tricky to get creative in clothing that I still feel comfortable and confident in. You can borrow my lady cellulite any time, but I think you're beautiful either way.   Also, love the Satie for the end credits. ;)"
"But you've ALWAYS looked so damn gorgeous and hot!"
"Jeez, she's looking hot these days."
"'biologically female brain' you just said the most validating thing to trans people on earth"
"This channel is beginning to have some worrying bourgeois undertones... No mention of the class aspect of the struggle of trans people? Not everyone can afford plastic surgery, in fact you are extremely privileged if you can, most trans people in the world have to make do without. They have a far less easy time as a result fitting in and experience more marginalization by society as a result. Again, the class struggle underpins every other social struggle. Please revert back to the leftist channel you used to be, talk about intersectionality and class in the context of the things you're going through.  As for the topic of the video, honestly, this societal obsession with beauty is borderline pathological, way too many people waste way too much time every day chasing this unattainable ideal.  Edit: Ok, you mentioned it all in the end. Yes, REVOLUTION! The only solution!"
"I wear makeup because -I- like it. Also I have dematiliomania and it has the double whammy of covering my OCD scars and making it difficult or impossible to scratch my cheeks.

"This was so painfully relatable. It was so nice to hear somebody else say it though; as one who has felt personally victimized by my own face my whole life, I learned to not to talk to much about it since it makes people feel weird. All that's left is to quietly agonize, skin-pick, and avoid any surface even vaguely reflective. Loved the synthy Satie at the end!"
"I appreciate that shady little zinger at 26:47 😘  Edit: that shade turns into straight up reading 😂"
"Beauty is an important part of every culture. Denying it exists is a lie. Its a social construct? Yes. And all social constructs exist because they lead to actions performed by individuals of that society. Does beauty have to be a homogenous aspect of society? No. Because then you will have people hating themselves or hating others because they dont fit a specific mold. Do we all should be considered beautiful despite our attempts to follow certain standars of beauty? Thats the most intriguing question 😉 Beauty isnt shallowness, beauty impacts societies on many levels and trivialize it or even reject with disgust the interest on beauty leaves a blank space on sociology, art, history, pschycology, and other areas where the human being tends to be the main subject of discussion"
"Natalie if it makes you feel any better I actually think your surgery was a major success in spite of how pretty you already were before. I'm not trans, but as a former anorexia sufferer, I understand the thought process of, 'stop telling me to love myself the way I am, I wanna be beautiful!!!'"
"ok so the first video i watched of yours, the incel one, i had no clue you were trans until you said so"
"Holy shit, you look really good in 'diseased state', I mean without make up. That's uncommon, add it to your self evaluation. It was the first thing that sold me on my wife years back when we first started dating hahah"
"straight people: AAAHHHHH Transgender people: AAAAHHH Me (a lesbian): eh"
"Borderline straight dude here and your analysis of how men view make-up makes me feel called the fuck out loooool, also the surgery has definitely done what it was intended to do, congrats  on the success and quickish recovery"
"Alright you asked for it... girl you look feminine as fuck and I hope you don't have to have surgery pains anymore. BAM tea spilt and other gay slangs."
"OMFG I missed you goddess!! 😭"
"You look great, I think you (the woman you show us you are) are great, I love your dress I want one, this is a run-on, thank you. I wonder if I'm beautiful because some days I look great, and others say so, but other days I think I'm normal and someone asks if I'm sick or why my face looks different when I already was having an 'ugly day'. I'm not saying I think I'm an ugly person, but it's not about not being the negative, but whether or not I'm the positive."
"Good lord, you look amazing :o"
"You are stunning honey <3"
"The surgery was noticable. It was always jarring to call my transgender female friend 'she', when she looked, acted, and dressed like a dude. You look much more like a woman now. Congratulations 👏"
"I have been watching your videos for about six months. As a straight male with no exposure to transgender world, I like to think I am here primarily because of your eye opening perspectives to identity, society, politics and philosophy.  But in truth, I am just very attracted to you physically."
"I think that many femoids like you and I go trough the similiar fases. As a teen you try so hard to be beautiful and as an adult you finally get to enjoy it instead of just crying about it. But then you kinda get bored of it since beauty only attracts people who like beauty, and doesn't really help you love and get loved. And then you settle to be beautiful only as a hobby, like on special occasions, and on weekdays focus on more fullfilling activities like eating and looking at other people. Maybe you get to enjoy the later fases too once your female puberty makes way. 🌼"
"I think you guys are all missing the point. Why be 'beautiful' when you can be interesting?"
"Yes the queen has returned!!"
"mother, ur so pretty."
"Maybe I'm just feeding into the shallow dopamine pool here, but hear me out. You have such a unique and mesmerizing beauty, with not only your physical appearance, but also your ideas, the way you speak, and the things you create. You really do epitomize the idea of 'style' you talked about in the end. And it's gorgeous."
"I do think that there is a hidden research treasure with femininity as seen by trans women. Because I can see that these women still have a very male pov of what femininity is, probably because society and men presented it to them as such. And being perceived as male when younger, they did not have the experience of women being surrounded by each other and knowing about the difference of this mask and reality. Then again as cp already said in another video, trans women have even less freedom to 'pass' and the stakes of punishment if they don't is much higher. Yet, in trans women videos I noticed that they hold themselves very much against the male perfect women ideal. Although there are many more, even socially acceptable female stereotypes to choose from."
"I thought you were beautiful before and I think you're beautiful now. The fact that you're also smart and funny as hell is just a bonus."
"It makes no sense for an anonymous person on the internet who has nothing to gain from you to call you beautiful just because they are 'nice.' You just are beautiful. But like you said, you can seep into people's minds and see it for yourself yet you'd still not be convinced if you yourself don't think that way. Great video though, you're amazing as always!"

"I’ve been dealing with a certain mental illness for 2 or so years now, though it began since high school.  I have am no longer myself and no longer want to be who I was. Despite a lot of people telling me that I look beautiful or fine I don’t see that. I actually do not care what the rest of the world thinks I look like. I am only beautiful to myself and the day I fix all my imperfections I will be able to say how beautiful I am.  Where I live having a golden tan is a symbol of beauty, yet every morning I bleach my skin and use sunscreen, I can no longer enjoy tanning, because I am ugly. The person in my mind and the one who tells me how to feel doesn’t match with the person in the mirror anymore.   P.s. you look absolutely beautiful without your makeup, you look like my 20 something year old Aunt if she didn’t force starve herself."

"Listening to you speak, I'm becoming convinced that body dysmorphia is indeed a mental disorder, and should be treated as such - Instead of altering your physiology, we should be correcting the defective metal processes and/or underlying endocrinological problems.  The condition matches up perfectly with the textbook definition of when a mental state is a disorder - when it interferes with your ability to live a normal life.  There is nothing inherently wrong with getting your nose straightened, breast augmentation/reduction to match your frame, scars are not natural and often remind people of how they got them - that's all fine.  BUT when someone's mental well being is jeopardized because they can not accept  their physical appearance, that's a mental illness. In many parts of the world, people commit suicide as they can not accept how dismal their prospects are,  In South Korea and Japan, many *children* commit suicide when it becomes apparent they do not have what it takes to get highly prestigious positions.   Both body dysmorphia and situation depression leading to suicide are NOT sane, both are extreme, illogical(a/k/a insane) reactions to objective reality.  If people can not function in objective reality, that's a mental disorder."
"personally i hate makeup and everything because as a black cis woman whose grandparents are from the mississippi... ever heard a joke about black churches and easter hats? ever been asked if you were ok if you weren't wearing makeup? ever heard about people shunning ladies in pantsuits at church? people who wear excessive amounts of perfume and laugh at you for just putting on a spritz? people who insist on wearing near-victorian levels of clothing to an outing, just to sweat the whole time and fan themselves? 'your bra strap is showing' supposedly cause for utmost embarrassment and immediate withdrawal from a social function??   yeah. even contrapoints as shown here for most of the video isn't doing enough with her hair for my family's taste.     even the ghetto ones make sure to have their wig, weave, makeup, nails, eyelashes, lipstick, pumps, wax, eyebrows, and EVERYTHING done before WORK(though thank GOD unlike the rural southerners they don't do that for EVERY errand)   it's just WAY too many hours of my day to waste on appearance, i have games to complain about and breadpills to take. (it already takes 3 hours to comb thick natural hair and they want me to do MORE?????)"

"The world does need ContraPoints. But if what contrapoints needs is to be Gigi 2, the world should respect her journey."
"Interesting, thanks for the explanations with the skull! Well done also for your honesty: I've known so many women who claimed they had not had surgery... when it was obvious this was the case! Or playing on words, like Botox is not surgery...  The end result is nice, but don't overdo it please. A couple of weeks ago, I saw a recent photograph of an actress I used to follow when she was in her 20s and 30s. She is now in her 50s. It was obvious she'd had surgery, but the outcome was nothing to write home about, so my first thought was that she'd been in an accident where she'd suffered injuries to her face... So maybe leave things as they are now? Plus, fear of ageing is usually fear of death. No amount of Botox or whatever is going to make you immortal. And instead of investing into creams and sprays and what not, invest into fresh vegetables. Check out Dr Pamela Popper: she looks good for her age, doesn't she? And to 'tone' the rest of your body, just do Pilates, or go swimming!"
"You look like Natalie Portman!"
"It would be really interesting to hear your opinion on the final section of Elizabeth Anderson's classic article 'What is the point of equality?' called 'The disabled, the ugly and other victims of bad luck'. There she discusses some of the questions you touch upon, for example if beauty is a welfare-right, considering the impact it can have on one's ability to participate in political society (think of the coupling of beauty, trustworthiness and political authority). She discusses both publicly subsidized plastic surgery on the one side, and combating beauty norms on the other. I find this problematic very hard: beauty is too fun and enjoyable to give up on, but it's also essentially unfair. Not everyone could be beautiful if anyone were to be at all, there must be heights and lows. Or perhaps your notion of style overcomes this dilemma."

"You're a beautiful human, you've always been beautiful. I am a 'portrait painter' (but I don't paint portraits for clients) and I have seen so many different faces that it's hard to tell what defines 'passing' anymore. I think a lot of people don't really pay that much attention to how different people look from one another and they think it's really easy to tell if someone is 'really' male or female. Once you've studied enough faces, it's almost impossible. I have seen almost every configuration of features on a face at this point. There is a certain range that most people recognize as 'normal', but when you start turning someone's face to different angles you realize how far out of 'normal' most people are. You have always had a beautiful face, no matter how you have identified. I hope that you feel comfortable with your 'new' appearance. :)"

"24:00 you realized the problem but instead of confronting it you said, i should change the reasons why i think i should be beautiful.  You try to fool yourself that if you change the rationalizations as to why you want to look beautiful you would feel beautiful and have no shame about it. This is wrong and is still playing the same game, the endless game of trying to achieve something that you consider unachievable. This is why you always say to yourself if i fix this flaws i will be beautiful, and then you go and do it and it fixes nothing on your self esteem in the long term. I know you know this because you explain so in your video. (try to imagine you wanting money or power instead of beauty, you then feel like crap because you know you want money because of the status, and to try to live a life of luxury, do you think the solution is to fool yourself to try to want money for a more righteous cause? no because those are not your motivations).  So you should escape the wheel instead of trying to change the meaning of the wheel. Those female scholars you talk about do this in their own way, but it is not necessary to abandon ever trying to feel beautiful.  You have to see the wheel find the misery at the end, lose hope in the wheel and surrender completely to the lack of ultimate beauty and meaning, and then you will realize that it was you all along. You where holding the carrot and the stick, but you can just go and grab the carrot. I think therefore i am."

"This is interesting. It's the first time I've seen a Contrapoint video that had anything I seriously disagreed with. I wholly support anyone that wants to focus on their aesthetic because it brings them personal pleasure.  But I think your perspective on this issue about why other people don't wear makeup could be widened by meeting and speaking with more women who dislike wearing makeup. And maybe not just some of our lesbian overlords."
"I'm a cis woman and I do want to fix my jaw too. And then I had my wisdom tooth removed and that hurt like a motherfucker. And then I realised, if removing a tooth hurts like that, how much does it fucking hurt if I shave off some of my bones. Fuck I think I will just stay ugly...."
"i disagree with her on so much, but it's so refreshing to see these videos. Youtube makes it too easy to get stuck in a right wing loophole, therefore this channel and others like it is very important"
"TL;DR: Leftists misconstrue two entirely separate market economic models, but I do like your videos and I'm writing this so that your videos can be more accurate in the future ^-^  Now I'm a Voluntaryist (AnCap) and i agree with quite a few things you talk about in this video; my main hang-up however is when you mention at 25:00 that leftists are ''Finely tuned detectors of Capitalism run amok''. Now the issue I have with this is due in part to a misunderstanding of the definition of Capitalism. Capitalism necessitates that any trade/transaction is Voluntary. But considering the market is Regulated, we do not have a Capitalist Market Economy. Capitalism requires the market economy to be Laissez Faire by default. We currently live and act in a Crony-Capitalist Market Economy (Corporatocracy/Corporatism) where the rich can buy power off the government in order to regulate the market in their favour- which is a breach of human rights. The fact that they are able to do this and not us as individuals is abhorrent and we Voluntaryists will 100% agree with you on that point."

"Rossy de Palma is an Spanish actress that is really known for her weird beauty. She has a prominent nose, weird teeth and look like... really big. I dont know if she've ever had plplastic surgery but its her personality that really catches the eye. I don't consider myself as a really handsome guy and somedays i kindda feel shitty about how i look.... But it's the attitude that really catches the atention. I watch your channel because i love how you see things. Don't get me wrong... it's not like 'i agree with everything you say because it's you who is saying it'. I really like the thought process you put in all your work. Remember that all you are phisically now will wither within a few years. But who you are and what you do will last you a life time. Great great job, don't let the bedbugs bite you :)"
"Okay can we stop with this misunderstanding abt east asian ppl and cosmetic surgery— the desire to have double eyelid surgeries and rhinoplasties are not the result of “wanting to look white—“ if you look at any kpop celebrity or other icon of korean beauty, you might notics they do not look “white” or uphold very many Eurocentric beauty standards by any stretch. They are seeking to uphold a different (yes still problematic af bc its a beauty standard most ppl cannot attain) beauty standard, which is more pixy like, with a small face with a petite pointed chin, large (usually double lidded eyes) and a narrow nose, but no one ever thinks abt the overall picture do they. Yes, the features they are seeking are more typical of caucasian faces, but the majority of east asians, by getting these surgeries, are not trying to look like those of european descent— they are trying to look like pretty asians. There is a great podcast episode from 99pi https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/double-standards/ that explains this in great depth. Listen to that before u go ranting abt how much more abt cosmetic surgery than i do."

"I'm not the sort to sugarcoat, life's too short to not say what you think in most cases.   I have been watching a while now, Natalie, around the time you posted your Incels video (so after you began identifying as a transgender woman instead of a transvestite man) but I did watch pretty much all your older videos, in most of which you're still a man, because I truly like your content; I find it witty and entertaining while informative on the whole trans thing (as I'm a straight cis man) and I agree a great deal with your liberal eco-socialist politics.   When I first saw you I thought you were hot but it did cross my mind as to whether you were trans (and later in he video you said you were) so while you were attractive to me, someone who only finds women attractive, you technically didn't 'pass.'  However I did notice over the course of your videos since, you getting progressively more feminine and attractive (and generally I have found following your gender transition an interesting story from medical, sociological and human interest perspectives.)  But when I started playing this one I was like 'still getting more lady like and beautiful, good for her, I don't think I'd suspect she might be transgender now' and then you were like 'I had face surgery!'  So while subtle, the surgery has made a difference in your so-called passability and increased it to the sort of level you've been looking for. Congratulations! Though, like I said, you had already become sexy to many straight men (I know I'm not the only one) by that time anyway.  I said what I said at the start so you'd know this isn't sycophantic fan gushing. I hate that shit. I'm a socialist who lives in a country run by sycophants to the capitalist establishment of another country that occupies mine and spent centuries trying to erase our culture and language while exploiting our people and environment to enrich themselves. So sycophancy annoys me and so I wouldn't compliment you so (I hope it comes across that way) without meaning it.  My point is basically well done for being yourself despite the challenges and don't give yourself such a hard time about whether you're beautiful and whether you should want to be (most of us get those worries and change our bodies in some way, such as me spending years putting on muscle at the gym, which I'm sure was less painful than getting my face reconstructed.)  Keep up the good work. I look forward to more."

"For a second I thought this was a goodbye video and had a micro stroke."
"I love your dress. :)  Regarding the topic, personally I am happy with myself without make-up most of the time, and I feel like a lot of fellow female academics are the same. It doesn't have to be about presenting more masculine to fit in, or taking refuge in being 'weird' (I don't actually think it's weird to not wear make-up). It is about presenting however I want, about literally not caring - and not caring feels *great.*  The occasional times I do care tend to be when I'm surrounded by women who've done amazing things with their make-up skills, which I admire, and I feel like I'm letting down the team by not making the same effort (due to being essentially lazy and valuing the time it would take to glam up my appearance more than I'd value a glam appearance).  I do feel, to a certain extent, being happy with my non-made-up appearance might be a bit privileged or something, but it's not like said appearance is so amazing (more like average). I think the real privilege is having an upbringing where I wasn't really told my value depended on my appearance, to the extent that I can largely ignore social and advertising messages to the contrary. (On the other hand, feeling like my value depends on how well I do academically is a distortion I *do* struggle with, and I very much admire you forging your own path in that respect rather than letting academia dictate your value.)"

"Thank you for talking about this. As a girl in my late teens I kinda hate myself for searching for beauty - I don‘t want to be the shallow, vain bitch portrayed in media. I want to be the bookish, smart girl. Weirdly those are portayed as beautiful all the time too.   I often catch myself thinking that I don‘t deserve some people in my life because they‘re far more attractive than me (not only crushes, also friends).  I really do need to forgive myself for seeking beauty. And I need to stop thinking of myself as ugly. I know I‘m not attractive to most people, but I hope one day someone will look at my face and think „this is a face I like“. Maybe that someone could even be me."

"Thank you for this video, Natalie. As a cis girl, I could relate with a lot of things you said."
"Like every girl has body dysphoria because the standard of beauty is so difficult to obtain, especially when we start ageing. But trans women have 'gender dysphoria' and get medical coverage for ffs. What about the women who are ugly and are discriminated against? Where is their ffs? Fucking lol men are men no matter what they dress up as, they'll always get priority over women.   Women in prison care about makeup because they've learned their lesson very well. If you're ugly you're worthless. You're not a woman if you're ugly, you're not even a human being.   You're not having 'fun' because beauty isn't a Hollywood movie. It's literally about constantly searching for flaws and trying to 'fix' them, even though it's futile since you can't fight against time. Why do you think women are more neurotic then men? They're told they're never good enough and must be vigilant to 'stay young & pretty'. It's a losing battle."

"I, someone who got over the whole 'not-like-othed-girls' pretty early  (around 14 I was already questioning internalized misogyny) don't wear more make up because 1) it's expensive and 2) it takes waaaay too long. I'd rather sleep a few more minutes than wake up earlier just to have a make up routine"
"Do you really want to stop doing contra?"
"Holy fuck, that intro. Is this a new episode of Black Mirror? Awesome"
"I agree with you and I know that this wasn't your point but something that should be pointed out is that not all surgeries are the same. there is a big difference in how much a surgery done for transitioning is based in dysphoria versus in vanity, for example top surgery and ffs come from different reasoning and I think it is important to point that out bc without explaining that there is a difference it makes things like hrt seem cosmetic rather than necessary for many people."
"That intro made every second of the wait between videos worth it. fuck yea I’ve been waiting for a new vid"
"Looks really nice!  I just miss your old nose a bit, but very happy for New you"
"'How did you find out you're gay?' Well, Natalie said she asked every straight man if they like make up, and didn't ask me, so there was only one logical conclusion. 'That's not-' Also I like dick."

"I've been thinking about my appearance lately. I was relatively good looking (for a nerd). But last year I had a baby so my body has been going through a shit show of changes for over a year. 9 mo to make the baby, and so far 9mos of recovery. I've been asked if I was pregnant twice since my baby was born. One of those gentle men told me 'don't go getting offended now' not a word of apology. I'm also in a very male dominated field. It is not unusual for me to go weeks without having a meeting with a single other woman in attendance. I am the only woman in my seating area. When I first started in my field I tried to fit in and dressed as masculine as I could, but when I was pregnant, it was impossible to fit in. Can't really make pregnancy seem masculine. I started dressing more feminine and wearing dresses to work. I realized I really liked it, and have continued to wear almost exclusively dresses. It's like my own professional middle finger to expectation that to be good I have to be a man. I still don't wear make up, mostly because I don't know how. But I really enjoy rocking my floral patern flowy dresses around an office full of khaki pants."

"Looksmaxxing is ridiculous. Men shouldn't need to use the approval of women as motivation to improve themselves.  When I look in the mirror to admire my chiseled triceps and rippling abs, I'm not thinking about how I'll finally be able to get women to fuck me. I don't even care about that. I'm engaged to a lovely lady who would have sexual relations with me even if I had flabby pecs.  What I'm thinking about is embodying the beauty of a Greek statue. I'm chasing the aesthetic. I want to be a living, breathing work of art."

And I won’t get elective surgery because children are dying in Yemen and, eventually we all get old and wrinkly so why throw money at capitalists who just want to gang up on humans. Max Factor etc are just a grown-up version of Sylvester McMonkey McBean."
"I have a lot of thoughts about makeup and beauty, most of which are probably influenced by the fact that I'm bad at it."
"One question is, to what extent are beauty standards genetically determined? There is likely to be a genetic element to attractiveness independent of societal norms and pressures.   Good video, but I think acknowledging these genetic influences would have enhanced discussion of the topic."

"I asked my bf to rate you out of 10 in this vid (he knows nothing about you) and he said 'she's an 8 if she had on less makeup'. I gave you a 7. My comment feels incredibly rude to write and I haven't commented on people's appearances ever before online  but I hoped you'd see this one as neither sycophantic or intentionally nasty.  Edit: except for mentioning lard ass, orange cock puppet trump's disgusting grotesque face and body but that's more an external expression of his moral, ethical (+ actual) bankruptcy."

"Been a fan of your stuff for a good while, but idk, one thing that does kind of strike out to me particularly in the recent videos is the amount of glorification of aesthetics. In your video about aesthetics, you say that it's the era of aesthetics rather than logic; so, in that sense, relying on aesthetics to reach an audience could be justified (but I doubt there's really audience being reached that did not already agree with you, so therefore - moot point). But having the aesthetics rely on ever increasing amounts of makeup, more and more costumes, wigs, surgery, etc, is basically a privilege given by imperialist capitalism (yeah, that's a very radcool phrase, but still). You can't honestly be seriously taken as standing against consumerism, capitalism, privilege, or believing in inner beauty, when you yourself gleefully dive into things provided to you by consumerism, capitalism and your privilege.  In this video, yeah, you bring this up yourself kind of towards the end, but saying one thing and doing the opposite doesn't really mean much. I'm not sure you're being fully intellectually honest anymore. Alas, I also don't believe, for a moment, that you'll really going to find an escape from your depression and anxieties by building your own fairytale castle to live in.  I'm not sure if I recognize this style of leftism as what's leftism to me. Left is about opposing hierarchies. Opposing transphobia, homophobia, etc, is naturally leftist, as discrimination is a form of hierarchization. But focusing excessively on beauty, aesthetics, consumption, hedonism, are also hierarchical things. Whole concept of beauty standards is a form of hierarchy. Excessive consumption (of which clothes, makeup, etc, make by far the largest part) is the largest problem we have stemming from capitalism. Here you appear to basically defend consumption in regards of one's outer beauty (a major driving point of consumerism, as established prior).  I also can't really agree with your idea that women are disposed to do make-up primarily due to their desire for self-expression. I come from a very different background than you no doubt, but women in my family and my life don't normally wear make-up except when going out. You might be right that the make-up isn't primarily used to attract fuckable mates, but that doesn't mean it still wasn't often used for the wrong reasons. I think it's actually pretty naive to believe that make-up and surgery is primarily gotten to promote one's own personal style. A lot of people use it just to fit in and to feel better about themselves. Why do they need to feel better about themselves by using make-up though? Because everyone else is using it and thus forcing even those, who wouldn't want to, to use it if they want to fit in. Our society's ever-increasing focus on supposed individuality (that's not really individuality, it's just marketed individuality) is not making anyone happier. It's making people worse off. Women in American prisons trade sex to get make-up and know what else is widespread in American prisons? Mental health issues. 2/3 of American women in prisons have a history with mental health issues. And I fucking guarantee that it's not because it's hard to get make-up. However I do suspect that our excessive concern about our appearances is very much linked to increased stress levels, anxiety and thus, mental health issues.  Aesthetically, you're super awesome though. Ironically enough."
"hey, lesbian here, im mostly chillin tbh, bc if other lesbians are anything like me, then they find the vast majority of women attractive regardless of how detailed their beauty regimen is and that makes me less concerned about looks in general"
"Thanks for the information (and entertainment) as always. Put a new perspective of why my gf (trans) did so many FFS operations before we met!"
"Pathetic (and excrutiatingly boring). Face blind ultra narcissism. He used to be attractive :("
"Fellow Monkey was Daddy AF and I don't care what anyone says! (Except maybe the hat. I should've gone with the austere hair and had done.)"
"I was just thinking about the 'I thought surgery would change my self image' thing this morning.  I think part of the reason some trans-people commit suicide or struggle with a deepening depression following gender-confirmation surgery is because they get the idea that the surgery will 'fix them', and when it doesn't they can't see any end or hope.  I mean, if changing everything about themselves via a difficult and painful surgery or series of surgeries doesn't make them happy, then they have to feel like nothing will.  Of course, I still believe that the outside forces play a larger factor, but that feeling that surgery can make you happy must be part of it."
"As a lesbian... yeah this might be the least easy to understand video of yours so far. I think this really is true... I like women, I am one... And I really find almost everything about women attractive, including myself, the one things I don't like is too much acne and that's all I guess, just it being healthy, not even wrinkles matter. :v. I do make up sometimes but it feels like a chore.... it's boring and I only do it sometimes because a look requires it or there will be photos taken and I want to look 'proper'. Moreover, I'm more attracted to feminine women or futches, hardly every to butches, yet don't mind dark circles or whatever that make up is supposed to cover up. Also I feel like my definition of 'feminine' might be kinda untraditional... What I'm looking for is the way you behave, grace is something I consider a very feminine attribute. Wide shoulders, flat chest, short hair, it's all fine, you just need to have that air and they way you style yourself to be feminine so also this video is weird cause I've always seen you as very feminine, with the plastic surgery or not. Really not much has changed in my view of you despite, of course seeing different features but the air about you is the same - extremely feminine. Also I'm sorry if you'll actually read this rambling, I don't know where I'm going with this anymore uhhh.... I mostly started to write it cause I'm procrastinating hahah, yeah so in conclusion - you're great and I, personally, find you very attractive, but found myself completely unable to relate to anything in this video, that's all :D. Okay.... tho the part about looking at women and dying inside instead of doing anything.... very true,.... that was relatable </3."
"I started watching the video while putting makeup on, alone at home. I have no plans of going out today and here I was applying red lipstick because it just feels very on brand for Me(TM) when Natalie hits me with 'choosing style over beauty. cultivating your own aesthetic as opposed to the collective idea of beauty' and I swear a sob that I didn't know was trapped in me just flew out. I crossed my arms and held myself as I felt the power and validation from those words. Thank you Natalie. From the very depths of my chubby heart, thank you."
"I cannot hear 'FFS' as anything other than 'for fuck's sake' without a lot of work, and when I think about how much pain and trouble it is, well, that sounds about right anyway.... ... which just goes to show that, if you're determined to go through with it, you've got one damned serious reason to GET it."
"I have never felt more seen by anything. This made me both laugh out loud and cry."
"Thank you ^^"
"is beauty inherit to being a woman? I think most people want to look beautiful but I don't think that's a inherent quality to a gender so much as beauty standards being applied more lopsidedly to womanhood."
"DON'T SKIP SUNSCREEN, ARE YOU MAD"
"when she started talking about style i was like, “oh. so that’s what i’ve been doing”"
"16:19 me 24/7"
"I think this is the most I've related to you, the thoughts and feelings around your appearance are so similar to internalized fatphobia."
"God, your smile when you said 'I'd fuck me too!' was adorable"
"does anyone know which eyeshadow palette she might have used? her eye makeup looks stunning 😍😍"
"You look good without makeup BTW gamer"

"You look absolutely gorgeous."
"I would give you a 30 minutes hug and I love you Natalie. I wish you could be my girlfriend."
"I think you look cute without makeup. Cute like a nerdy girl in a library that I fall in love with."
"You’re right about beauty serving a greater social function. I got braces when I was in college because I read somewhere that people with straight teeth get paid more. Now my eyelids are just flakey for no known reason. I need all the deets on your face moisturizing technique, I’m so embarrassed and there’s too many beauty gurus to figure it out. I already like your content, I’d rather just use your technique even though that wasn’t the point of this video."
"Most definitely love the sense of humor that comes with your videos Ms. Natalie.  Keep being awesome."
"You are always your own worst critic. I know I am mine. If I could afford to look more like all the beautiful women I wished I looked more like, and less like the dog faced gremlin I see in the mirror, I know I would still see the dog faced gremlin. I guess that is just how self loathing goes. No matter how much I change my appearance, I will always hate what I see in the mirror, because I will always see myself. Stay in the fight, and keep swinging. We will get there one day."
"Okay so Natalie looks great and all, but can we talk about that skull prop was used to tie together plastic surgery with phrenology with vanitas motifs? That's a clever-ass bridging of concepts."
"“I know what women want. They want to be beautiful.”  Valentino"
"OK. Too bad you touched your nose. Here's for my bone structure critique"
"thanks for stimulating my 3 only brain cells; laugh, think smart thought, and boots the house"
"I have sympasies for your struggle, but I just can not relate I guess spending almost 3 decades as a fat, ugly ace made me too tired to care at some point"
"The plastic surgery stuff sounds terrifying.   There are so many things about you that make you really attractive, Natalie. I'll save the 'I told you so' for a decade or two down the line, when cougar Natalie looks back on old photos of herself and videos and gets super annoyed at her past self for not knowing she's the shit. You'll be equally offended as the rest of us now-rated-lower-than-6 peasants. ;P"
"I would really not use Lizzie as an example...after what went down in Love after Lockup. She said herself that she was using her appearance to get tricks to pay for her."
"But... you were always pretty ;_;"
"You are giving me Celine Dion realness <3"
"Just came from your old videos and wow, you have changed so much... Your voice and your appearance, you´re just a gorgeous woman :D (You could also choke me, if you like :3 ;) I don´t really like being seen as beautiful, it does´t feel like it fits my priorities. But I definitely like looking at beautiful people. I just think that beauty will never be one of my defining characteristics and none i want to get attention for. Strange double standards, eh?"
"I really hope you feel more confident nat!! I support you so much 🖤"
"Funny that you made this video right now because I’ve been spending a lot of time on r/trufemcels and r/TheGlowUp. I’ve never cared about my appearance at all before (bc internalized misogyny I think) but I’ve just started noticing how important being pretty is when it comes to how other people treat you... so I’ve started looksmaxxing and learning makeup and stuff now."
"I am studying biology as a woman, who wears a full face of makeup and loves dresses and skirts and trendy things... I definitely get judged for it & not taken seriously. I have to prove myself in every lab to show people I deserve to be there. And I know for a fact this is happening, it's not just a feeling. I had someone in a class of mine tell a mutual friend they just 'kind of assumed' that I was 'pretty dumb' until I said something in class and the professor said it was a good comment... This person actually happened to be a TA in another class I was taking at the time.  I was so hurt by that and seriously considered changing the way I present myself in class. I didn't... but I can't pretend I didn't solely because of a 'fuck-you I'll wear this fuchsia ombre lip AND you'll respect me' empowered feeling. It was maybe 30% that... but 70% that I rely on those things to feel beautiful and feeling beautiful is WAY to fucking important to me for health. I mean fuck, I struggle with an eating disorder, clearly being beautiful takes up too much of my headspace, I KNOW that.   And that does kind of make me stupid, I guess. At least according to a lot of people, and almost definitely according to the person who thought I was 'dumb' in the first place, because I'm using precious brain space to think about better ways to apply lipliner instead of to change the world or whatever the fuck they think they're doing. So it doesn't really matter what I know about prenatal phthalate exposure or whatever... I'm stupid anyways. Or at least frivolous. I also have a lot of other frivolous, non-academic interests, though, I love to bake, I love to embroider and crotchet, I love running and swimming, I have never been made to feel that any of those things erode my critical thinking ability. I just wish I was free to both cope with my cripplingly low self esteem and battle it without being made to feel like an idiot for doing it. 😞"
"Another video where Nat has these hilariously cute 'out of character' moments. You can tell where she clearly like, giggles at her own joke and you have a glance at the person partially behind the persona. I love these moments. :)"
"I respect this. Being honest even though I still believe you are beautiful without it. The inner can make someone who appears attractive on the outside look so ugly. Anyhow do you girl. Whatever makes you happy."
"You don't owe it to the world to be Contrapoints.  I absolutely adore your work but please don't keep staring into the internet abyss if it's too taxing.  I'd rather you be a 31 year old Gigi impersonator than depress yourself to death."
"Natalie, you radiant queen, I needed that last bit about creating the taste by which one is appreciated. Your videos are always perfect food for thought. Thanks for existing, girl."
"Style: if beauty doesn't work for you, look cool AF instead."
"I'm not being a HUN but honestly I thought your facial structure was totally gorgeous an feminine to begin with. I have a manlier jaw than you did and i was born a woman 😂 however I think you also look beautiful now, its just taking me a while to get used to it cause the differences are so subtle but so different at the same time?! FFS is wild. also I feel though about the not knowing if you're pretty thing, occasionally you'll look in the mirror and go 'oh cool I think I look alright' and some of those days I'm not even wearing makeup, my weird redness just subsides for a bit lmao. however most of the time I look in the mirror and I'm just like 'thats a face'. I think most people feel that way, we see our own faces too often. I think there was some science-y thing said about how our brains overcorrect our own faces when we look at it and also your face is flipped in the mirror, which is why looking at photographs of yourself or videos feels really weird. edit: I'm now at the part of the video where you have no makeup on and my caveman brain has finally adjusted - wow <3 so pretty! I wish I looked that good without makeup lol I just look like a pig"
"Tag yourself I'm 'being misgendered at Dairy Queen'"
"You are, and always have been, a beautiful woman. No, I'm not kidding, and yes, I have watched your early videos."
"I often hear that people get depressed after surgery - post surgery depression that is. Live your truth the best you can"
"You should really take up meditation and find that middle way, suffering is a bitch but its not really unavoidable."
"Oh god i can guarantee lesbians do care about their looks. I'd never cared about it so much before i became a lesbian. It's just that... well we developed our own standards i guess I mean a nice ladystache is kinda cute"
"You could do ASMR :)"
"There are many types of beauty. For example you can be absolutely flat and even wear man's clothes and still be cute as hell like Tilda Swinton or Kate Moennig."
"that lil ASMR part aaaaaaaa I replayed it too many times.... sometimes I don't know if I'm just mimicking my confidence and that I feel beautiful or I really believe and feel like it.  your ffs succeeded so well, you totally look like a more feminine you :D wish you would feel beautiful more than once a month"
"'My daddy dom' 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
"my throat is DRY with appreciation"
"The erik satire remix is siq"
"FFS..."
"Damn Natalie I thought you saw Satie as an amateur."
"Wow the quality of the video is amazing as always! Thank you so much for sharing your feelings and experiences in such an honest way. I admire your style and the unique style of your videos.  You said that you want to be beautiful and at the same time that it’s hard for you to tell how you look. I sometimes also feel this way. Maybe it is because we are not able to see ourselves through other people eyes?and we just see ourselves as we are, whereas beauty is subjective characteristic. And there is no absolute beauty? And these standards are only the constructions by society, associated with power, true. But it is not very defined characteristics, as all the other notions that we invented as humanity. throughout the history what was considered beautiful changed, what was associated with femininity and masculinity changed. Even now when we have conventional media inspired beauty standards (especially for women), which are extremely unobtainable and controversial, by the way, different people have their own perceptions of beauty. And sometimes (at least for me) whether I consider someone beautiful is not based of “are they conventional standard of beauty for their gender”. It isn’t. It’s more like the whole appearance - the looks, yes, but also their charisma, how and what they talk about, their unique sense of humor, their smarts, as you said THEIR STYLE, yes. So, I personally don’t think that your fans want to flatter you or exaggerate when they say “you’re beautiful”, I think they mean it."
"That is the best pronounciation of Van Gogh by someone who (as far as I know) doesn't speek Dutch in a long time. GG"
"When you did the daytime skincare bit, you genuinely looked like Simone Giertz, the shitty robot Queen!!   But yeah wow, go you!"
"Almost as if leftist ideas were IDEALS and not realistic approaches toward solving a problem. People wanna look pretty. Even if that's harmful to everyone. You can't cancel it, because it's not artificial. It's part of us. Same with literally every problem the left has."
"I went into this thinking it was going to leave me feeling like an ugly manish beast as Natalie lays down her insights, but so much resonated with my own pains and was relatable, I actually feel kinda optimistic with my ongoing transitioning. Also, Natalie, you are very brave - and kind - in allowing us to take a glimpse at the down-to-earth reality behind the carefully curated and well presented persona people in the public eye have to manage"
"For what it's worth I'm glad your surgery and recovery went over well."
"You know how weird is watching old contrapoints videos when he was still a boy?"
"Sophie! Nice."
"A wonderful video, excellent production and very intelligent and thought-provoking handling of the subject. I loved the little silly breaks, and how you described that knowing beauty is a social construct, doesn't make you feel any different about trying to be beautiful. I have recently become interested in stoicism, which postulates that we are only in control of our thoughts and perceptions. What happens to us and around us is not inherently good or bad, what matters is how we perceive it. Striving to obtain something is not a bad thing, but realize (and accept) that you may fail in your pursuit. Try to better, but accept that it may not work out. Accept who you are. Thank you for sharing your journey with us."
"First of all, Natalie looks amazing!  Also, I'm just like everyone else, obsessed and personally failing at being beautiful, but I just wanted to add a little input from the perspective of different cultures. There's beauty and there's beauty.    I've lived in Europe, the UK and often stayed in the US. When I lived in the UK and stayed in the US I felt constantly ugly and like beauty was hard work. I waxed, got manicures and pedicures, used fake eyelashes and felt like a dumpling if I wasn't wearing self-tanner. That is because that was the beauty standard in those places, and everyone rigorously followed it and shamed those that didn't. It felt impossible to keep up and depressed me.    But when I moved to mainland Europe I got a real shock. The first time I went out with my new friends in a skin-tight dress, heels and fake eyelashes I felt like high-class sex worker. All the girls around me wore jeans, t-shirts, sneakers and a bit of mascara. I'm not saying mainland Europe isn't cis, white and able-bodied worshipping, but the beauty standards here are MUCH easier to achieve, so I feel pretty 3 times a month rather than never."
"I've never felt more understood than you thinking of detective pikachu dancing"
"The SOPHIE in the intro ... 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽"
"I really relate to the way you describe the experience of looking at yourself; I feel much the same way.  I am a middle aged Cis het man and I grew a Luxuriant beard  because I'm too lazy to shave and I got fed up of looking at my face in the bathroom mirror."
"I've always been under the impression that women wear makeup for the same reason men wear tailored suits. It's a confidence booster and makes most more attractive and being beautiful has a cascading effect of benefits. It is in everyone's best interests to be beautiful and confident. Is this even partially correct, from the female perspective?"
"you ARE the beautiful people"
"The IRS line was hilarious, thank you."
"good video, but why is this 6‘3“ guy in drag and putting on a fake girly voice?"
"make me lick your high heels mommy"
"as someone who only recently found you and has now seen your face with less heavy makeup (2:10), i have to say that you are quite attractive. also if i would see sb on the street coming at me looking like you do there, i would be 100% sure its a woman, not even a doubt."
"Some of us HAVE been here since your very first YT video.  Natalie I just thought youd improved your make up skills even further and that the oestrogen was doing its thing. You look great. That's the truth."
"The production quality of all your videos is always amazing. As for you saying you only feel beautiful once a month... I'm now running for president and will make it illegal for you to think you're anything but beautiful. You are beautiful, regardless of how you feel about yourself."
"They never got near my tabloids."

"I will agree with the lesbian part I have given up on any sort of care regarding beauty (butmaybe thats because im also ugly as shit)"
"Blown away by that intro. Please stay as horrifying as you are beautiful."
"Oh yea there was the Fear and loathing in Las Vegas vibe.  Btw thank you for making me think about things, I usually dont think about. Great & funny video!"
"Pretty impressed how you pronounced Van Gogh tbh   I genuinely hope you feel beautiful 💖 I think you're very beautiful (though I already found you very beautiful before surgery also!)"

"I just got my first plastic surgery and juvederm over the past 6 months. I have been looking myself in the mirror all my life and my problems with my self-image seems to go worse. My eyes seems to go directly to my 'flaws' whenever i stare at myself.  I am thinking about getting botox, juvederm and (maybe?) lifting all the time. It literally eats my brain. I just want this to stop and I want to represent my image the way that i feel it should be."

"I love your videos. You are the voice of a generation"
"Didn't realize how much your videos would make my weeks until you left and now have come back. Good to have you going strong again with all the same comedic skill and good philosophical discourse.

"Natalie. You're beautiful because of your humor and intellect. These people don't stan you because you look good, it's just a bonus. Anyone worth a minute of your time will recognize this."
"16:10 I honestly can't tell if I'm opposed to gender-stereotyping to the degree I am because I'm gender neutral or if it's the other way around. And the existential anxiety this causes in me is honestly a bigger issue than your opinion of me, Natalie. Sorry."
"G-d, I’m sitting here watching you talk about beauty but like...I wish I were even _half_ as beautiful as you are (even before the FFS; though the FFS turned out amazing btw). I’ve just come to accept that I’m never gonna be one of the beautiful people, and even though it hurts, it’s also brought me a lot more peace of mind. Radical acceptance y’all.

"I'm happy to see your beautiful 'new' face, still looking like you, and that you came through it all healthy and that you are pleased with the result. The sequined top is so fabulous I don't think most people could wear it and still have me looking at their face. More power to you Natalie. Your work is courageous and important. xxoo"
"I’m a cis woman and while I think I’m all about self love and body positivity I also can’t look at my graduation pics from 2 years ago because the gown made me look like a linebacker(or maybe I just do). And I still hate my face cuz I think I look like a man but I’m never misgendered so I guess that’s why I can sometimes ignore while trans people can’t because they stressed they’ll be found out and then once they do pass most of the time they have to worry some sick dude hits on them then when they find out the person is trans they just kill them, a no pure win situation."

"Beauty standards are evolutionary. Not socially constructed."
"Beauty is, and has always been, subjective. The problem, is people acting like it's an objective thing. Different strokes for different folks. What one person finds attractive, another person will find unremarkable, and visa versa, and nothing will ever change that."
"the gymnopedie remix in the credits absolutely slaps"
"Oh Natalie, not only do you have style, you have verve!  (And dw, false modesty is super femme passing.)"
"Let me attempt a compliment that you allow to count. I m a girl that puts on makeup less than 10 times a year but as someone who spends up to 60 hours painting pixel perfect cartoon skin it can sometimes freak me out to look in the mirror and see the tiniest imperfections, yes it absolutely matters what your eye gets used to :D! But I see you at your most beautiful when you laugh sitting at the piano or when you leave those takes in the final video, where you have truely let go for a little split second. Not that I don't enjoy your performance, it sure keeps me comming back to your videos! But I noticed those little moments are really stuck vividly in my brain like moments I have shared with a friend or a loved one. Also the humor that comes from YOUR face combined with those asymmetrical funky mouth 'jerks' and raised eyebrows is astonishing and it is enhanced exactly because you are beautiful. I might speak from an artists perspective, but I feel like the majority of people picks up on this stuff, maybe without beeing able to point to it and see it as the genuine source of your charms. And you add so much extra on top! Another thing that stuck with me is when you once said you actually liked your voice, that sparked some joy here :D Hope you can say the same thing about all of you one day!"
"13:29 chilling"
"you're a fabulous freak of nature no matter how you slice it (err...pun not really intended?)"
"For many reasons, the quest to look 'pretty' fucks with me to no end, so realizing this, I decided to not strive to look 'pretty. fuck pretty. I mean, for myself. what others strive for is their decision. but instead I strive to be visually interesting and that has been like unbuttoning that first button on your jeans after a big meal - for the soul lol #classy. I've also started sharing images of myself in the name of creating representation as a proudly disabled human #DisabledAF  , but I'd be lying if I said that didn't fuck with me. What you said about not being hyper critical re: other people, but then being absurdly hyper critical to yourself is fucking relatable. But viewing the images as a form of protest and representation and striving for visually interesting instead of 'pretty' (conforming to the standards of beauty) helps which I feel is similar to your idea of beautiful vs style etc"
"You do have style though. You look like a Jackson Pollock painting, all riotous colour and vibrancy. It’s wonderful."
"where is that dress from, I'm in love."
"Oh I wish lesbians were “straight chillin”, but my mom spent years berating my appearance, body, hair, style, etc... so now I have a complex and an eating disorder. Cheers!  She was perfectly accepting of my sexuality, but only if I presented as a femme/a lipstick lesbian."
"Don’t know if you read your comments but I love your videos.  Far too much time between them.  Congrats on the surgery.  While I personally thought you were gorgeous the way you were it’s meaningless if we want what we want.  While I’m a cis male I have some understanding of dysphoria.  I’m a 400 pound guy that has an image of himself that isn’t a 400 pound guy.  I’m attempting to lose it but if there were a surgery that removed the fat, I would do it instantly.  On the less dysphoric side of shit, here’s a video of Joe Biden raging on Mexicans."
"Looking real good after surgery! Of course, you were already beautiful before the surgery, but now you're a different beauty!"
"why is everything memes nowadays ahhhhh"
"im cis woma but i legit kinda feel dysphoria cause of my m a n f ac )="
"When out in the street I never look at someone and think ‘god they have nothing about them that is beautiful’. It’s strange how we have different thought processes when we look at ourselves. I wonder if I hold others’ appearance on a higher pedestal because of the negative perspective of myself... But then again, why shouldn’t I? And why shouldn’t I view myself with the same optimism?"
"Well it certainly is moist, yes."
"You stepped up your game with that intro"
"*_S T E P  O N  M E  M O M M Y_*"
"I can fap to this?"
"good luck, bud."
"Beauty is also individually very subjective. As far as ones own appearance goes, i've always just done what feels comfortable for me - but I am also an incredibly lazy academic lesbian..."
"You are beautiful."
"I love you so much 😭 this video hurt my brain but also reminded me to put BB cream on for a job interview lmao"
"I know it doesn't sound poetic or 'motivational', and I don't know if you will see this, but I skipped the teenage-self-hate phase in my life by brainwashing myself everyday in front of my mirror. I just told my reflection that I'm beautiful until one day I believed me. you can try that if you want to."
"This is relatable af. I'm a cis woman who's only just started wearing make up in an effort to feminise my tomboy look a little bit. I have no idea if I look good wearing it or not. It's a fucking pain in the arse, and I'm *always* self-conscious wearing it, but I feel like I have to do it. It's funny how we have the 'do I look feminine enough?' thing in common ;)  This was a really interesting video. Thanks so much for exploring these issues in your incredibly smart way, as usual."
"Vincent van *GGOGGGH*. ah, I see my fellow Dutchies have gotten to you haha."
"I am a 22 year old trans woman. My life has reached a point where once every 10-15 days, I suffer an extreme mental breakdown where I am unable to do anything but scream and claw at my face while doing so. I have cut my face with sharp objects many times in the past, but only recently have I resorted to just doing it with my bare hands. I claw at it because I want to pull it off. I want it to be gone. The agony I get from the way my skull is shaped has disabled my life entirely. I don't go outside, I don't work, I am utterly unable to do anything but distract myself, and hurt myself."
"Just wanted to point out that JP wasn't saying that women always put on makeup as a 'sexual stimulus', but that that was the result, regardless of the intention. He did word it poorly though, so he made it very easy to misunderstand his point."
"I'm a heterosexual cis gendered male, and I've had work done on my face too. Not because I'm an incel, but because I feel the same way about beauty as you do."
"The whole concept that surgeries aren't the sole solution to a problem and that mindset plays a good role reminds me of the song 'Good Thoughts, Bad Thoughts', specifically the lines 'An attitude is all you need to rise and walk away"
"- Inspire yourself - Your life is yours - It fits you like your skin'."
"F"
"I felt that comment about how having beauty or exceptional style is ...almost...'frowned' upon in academia? I'm not sure sometimes if it really is frowned upon or if its totally made up in my head and I'm projecting.  I'm in college and I'm a good student actually.  Got straight A's two semesters in a row.  But when I actually put effort into my appearance and go to class....there seems to be this tension like people think i'm some stuck-up vacuous shallow person.  But again, I have no idea how much of that im projecting. I just notice the women around me in academia don't bother much with personal appearance or style.  I can understand wearing business attire so that your outfit isn't distracting if you're giving an oral presentation.  But damn it if I'm going to pull my hair back in a tight bun and not do up my makeup nicely. anyone else? thoughts?"
"youre not a 6 atleast a 7"
"Your videos always make me laugh out loud.  I like to watch them the morning after you post to get the day started on a good foot.  I think Hume was mostly right about reason being a slave to the passions, but he missed that at times your reason and your desires/passions can pull you in opposite directions.  I have all too often intellectually disparaged a thing at length only to realize later that, oh no! I want that thing.     Anyway, in parting, you do look very pretty."
"Maybe my favourite human being?"
"Sophie!!"
"1:21 LET ME HEAR YOUR WAR CRY"
"Damn Natalie you are so gorgeous! We are all obsessed with being beautiful but you absolutely nail it! Your honesty is astonishing."
"I am neither a fan nor a hater - this is my first ContraPoints video. You look fine. It's hard to be '''beautiful'''. In fact, there is only like one or two females I personally find totally beautiful in the whole wide world. One is my first love and the other changes all the time. With both it's painfully obvious that it's completely subjective to me. But I don't really seek this elusive perfection of beauty, I think. So called flaws can be very attractive, especially if the person 'owns them', so to speak. There was this one gal in my life who was so aware of her flaws and so happy with them that I still can't decide if I strongly loved or hated her. She was a strong presence. It's up for debate if you look '''beautiful''', but I think you look interesting and charismatic and like you have an actual personality. And forgive me if using the following quote has some implications that I did not intend for, but 'personality goes a long way'."
"As a woman in academia, Ive noticed that women who dont wear makeup dont do it to avoid being like other girls but because we are tired and aren't up for putting in the time and effort to do makeup.   I enjoy looking and feeling pretty but while Im doing this grad school thing the world is lucky to see me in anything more than lip balm."
"Woah the production value skyrockets higher and higher with every video"
"Your vids are so goddamn important!!!! So grateful for your work"
"Superb video. If we all could learn to love ourselves a little more..."
"I'm gonna be that 'not all straight men' guy (lol) and say that I wear makeup myself, and I enjoy seeing both natural and artfully done makeup that's 'out there' (probably why my wife and I love cosplay, lol).  Anyway, I really enjoy your channel - your joke delivery is spot-on and hilarious, the deep dives delve into the complexity of thought on the various topics as well as anyone could (imo), you look beautiful doing it.  And seriously, your makeup work is just crazy impressive.  All this coming from a 39-year old happily-married guy might not mean much, but I hope it brightens your day at least a bit (because it's the truth). :)"
"I'm happy this is a return to the introspection of the host that is contrapoints."
"15:37 Wait... so people think women are sucking makeup so they can put on dicks?"

"Natalie kinda has Ann Coulter vibes now post FFS  *But basically the anti Coulter because she's actually intelligent and hilarious"
"Throw dem pearls with abandon, because they're recreating society to our leastest understanding anyways"
"Hello. Maybe women keep wearing makeup even when no men are around just because wearing some has become such a daily routine that it got linked to the positive feeling of wearing something. I know i feel vulnerable and clumsy when I'm naked outside a shower even if l am positively alone (so,underwears are not anymore solely to keep my privates private, yet, are not a channel of expression either, just a mean to avoid a habits induced weird feeling). Plus, not wearing/wearing make up is going to be interpreted, not only by men, but by everyone, including other inmates anyway. Jugement probably leads to tougher status realted situations in there... The self expression part falls, I think, more in the realm of the side effect compared to the others , since anything that you do yourself is revealing some of you anyway. It can't be avoided and provides a bit of acomplishment satisfaction."

"Dropping out of a pHD course to become a camgirl is the greatest concept imaginable"

"girl I make myself up sometimes even if im staying alone inside all day full hikki for fun. but then I get upset I have no-one to preform for but im not in the mood for people rn. I dont wanna touch anyone but I love preforming... hmmm"
"I think you have great style, Natalie. But then I have no style, so at best this is just a well-meaning comment that might give you a dopamine hit but still feed the pit of doubt and despair inside all of us."
"Dairy Queen in the US sells...burgers?‽?"
"i really enjoyed this video :)"
"Dairy Queen in the US sells...burgers?‽?"
"SOPHIE song in a ContraPoints video! Yes!"
"Satan's apple is what NB people call it"
"Well... you do emit a more 'happier' vibe as of late...   Just remember not to lose yourself in all this analysis and try to wholeheartedly enjoy things. Things are still enjoyable."
"Kind of makes me realize, how easy it is to get hooked on plastic surgery. Like you said, in the end no amount of surgeries will fix the distortion that is in the brain 😢"
"This is the funniest script you've put out in ages."
"Fear of Underachievement is the engine, that keeps capitalism running."
"So there's this Zoe Blade song at 23:06 that I've heard before and always want to find because it SLAPS. Anyone know which one it is?"
"Oh don't worry. To me, you're one of those other trans women on YouTube who's SO young and SO beautiful it makes me want to throw up. And in comparison, for a long time, I've felt like this shabby, aging transvestite; just this feral cat wandering the aisles of the liquor store. So there's that.  And the worst part is that I want to YouTube but I'm older and less beautiful than every single trans YouTuber that I've ever heard of. So I think you're fine. Buck up."
"THAT EDITING THO GAVE ME CHILLS"
"What is the name of that one piano song that’s covered at the end I’m so desperate to know I’ve been scouring cyberspace for years and yet it eludes me??"
"14:26 Pardon my inability to tell, Miss Natalie, but weren't you without make-up in that 'abolish gender' segment in the 'Gender Critical' video? Because if you truly were, then you looked stunningly beautiful without make-up."
"i think Natalie kinda broaches this by bringing up style and how it's a way around conventional beauty standards (and i'm also fully aware that she's to some extent joking by calling grad students beckys so don't come for me), but i still think its important to go beyond the not like other girls/femme=frivolous stereotypes when it comes to women who don't wear make up. as a woman who wore make up everyday (one who's not white) it took me YEARS to finally be ok exiting my house with a bare face (and finding a 'style' that suits me has definitely helped with this) but I made the effort because i was tired, broke, lacked self-esteem, etc. and (frankly) could think of better things to do with my time in this 'imperialist white supremacist capitalist patriarchy' we call home. i think its important to remember that as much as people might be wearing make up for themselves, they might be choosing not to for the same reason. one of the side effects of femme=frivolous is that make-up isn't seen as a form of labor or effort. maybe (as well as being special beckys) those grad students are burnt out and have two classes to teach in the morning and a paper due the next? you know? ok i'm done   (also that pikachu/brain clip made my day)"
"I don't think that the pressing question here is 'How do we change society?' The question is, 'How do we change society before it's too late and we all die?' And the only answer to that question, I think, is revolution."
"I wanna be smoother than hunter avallone's brain"
"Both of my sisters don't tend to use  makeup/if they do it isn't much, BUT they take care of their skin well. Men or women, I prefer people just take care of their faces. That's nice. Make up is odd to me"
"you look absolutely amazing"
"yr da bes < 3"
"Intro gave me anxiety but it was worth it for the hot facts :)"
"I WAS LATE I AM SORRY NAT!! 😭"
"Honestly, when I first started watching your videos, (Jordan peterson-TOP NOTCH, BTW) I had no idea you were transitioning until you mentioned it (shortly after the bath scene started... My favorite part!) and I was surprised! Especially when that scene began I remember thinking to myself 'omg she is so gorgeous AND hilariously intelligent!' Then I spent the rest of the night watching as many videos as I could find, because, like always, each one gets me to think about things I have never really thought about before.  Viewpoints I have never considered on topics I never delved in to.  Your talent is astoundingly awesome and I am so glad you are sharing it with us."
">Queen uploads >Depression has left the chat"
"'..surgery... is not the solution to deep psychological issues..' how far can we extend this to any dysphoria.  it just seem that in the end, dysphoria is a 1st world problem.  having enough money to be beautiful so you can be worthy of love.  so now this channel has taken a turn.  its not about a trans person in the world anymore.  now its about a privileged person who only has to deal with herself."
"'If fiction has taught me anything, the righteous ones tend to be better looking. And generally white.' (Croshaw, Yahtzee - 2010)"
"The production value of that intro felt above YouTube imo"
"I think you look pretty and I like hearing what you have to say"
"Well, looks like every woman has to face style as an alternative to beauty when she turns 30. I dyed my hair pink and got a tattoo and can recommend this to everyone. 😃  Love your videos and your style evolution (not only your beauty)"
"most real GRWM in Youtube history"
"I thought the video was kind of a waste of time (just wasn't into it personally), I'm not one of your fans, and I have no investment in your feelings. There's no reason for me to say you are sexy unless I genuinely thought so. You are sexy as hell."
"Youre so pretty, smart AND funny like???? Date me??????????? Youre too perfect??????"
"Good video. I know very little about this topic, but love to learn more!"
"I'm gonna armchair a lot of this, so youtube is the perfect place. I think altering your appearance, whether through diet, exercise, or care products, is mostly for self-confidence. It's when you push your appearance out to society (through visiting social places or engaging in social media) that you search for validation to reaffirm that self-confidence. By engaging with media that constantly criticizes your appearance without factoring in your appearance, you're constantly weakening your own self-confidence, all so you can be sold back that confidence through products.    What I want to get is beyond all that and say, Contra, if you're having a bad day, try again tomorrow. It could be better. If you're having a bad week, take a break from some seeking of validation and focus on your own happiness and self-confidence. I hope you go out in the world and experience marvels of humanity. You contribute a lot to the mental health of people that want to make sense of the world, and plenty of us want you to be the best you can be."
"I know there are a shit ton of comments here but honestly I wish you were my friend"
"Thank you for acknowledging the importance of sunk costs to skin care u_u"
"YAY SOPHIE"
"Insofar as I can tell, this video was 3/4 of a Nietzsche ubermënch's (or uberfrau? Google translate?) transformation: to acknowledge the lack of inherent worth in societal value judgements, to be cradled in nihilism for a spell, and to rise up  with your own set of value judgements. The missing quarter appears to be that one may see it as a failure if, after all of this, the resulting set of value judgement trends toward one's society's.   To be independant is not to be in opposition (notwithstanding what the 4th of July mythically stands for in the US). Just because society values oxygen breathing (maybe? I don't know anymore with the whole climate change situation) doesn't make one's valuation of oxygen breathing slave to the society. An extreme example, but if you repeat the exercise with more contentious non-essential things, you may find similar outcomes; Natalie certainly has, whether she realizes it or not."
"I love your savage, deeply personal commentary. If I ever went to the US and happened upon you on the street, I'd beg to buy you a cup of coffee at Starbucks filled with ideology and discuss how ultimately meaningless but pretty damn interesting life is."
"I think the issue lies more in the fact that you have to pay for the surgery more than the surgery in itself. The problem lies in the fact that not all people are going to be able to afford surgery, which creates a pretty prominent line between those who can and cant. To not address that we have a set beauty standard in which we either subconsciously or consciously want to achieve is in my opinion a bit naive. If we fall into the temptation of changing our appearance we have even more people to compare ourselves to. Which leads us to being more likely to feed into the system that discriminates us based on the way we look, and take advantage of our insecurities. Of course its ok to want to be beautiful, the problem is that we have a system that tells us that we are ugly as we are, that we have problems that HAVE to be changed for us to be accepted by society. So i won't criticize you on your decision on feminization because i see were you come from. We are all a product of the culture of our time and we can only hope for it to change for the better in the future."
"Thanks for being the Contrapoints that the world needs right now! Keep up the important work!  *Cues the song of the people*  https://youtu.be/MIC8JJjG_sI"
"Shes back!"
"It's funny- this stuff really is pretty insidious. I'm a butch lesbian, and I feel actively uncomfortable with presenting femininely, even with being called 'pretty'- feminine beauty is not something I aspire to. I feel most comfortable at my unfeminine. and at the same time, especially if I'm spending time w/ pretty straight people, I feel... ugly for largely that same rejection of femininity that is required for me to be comfortable (to be ~myself in whatever nebulous feelgood way we want to define That). I'm still affected by this draw to be appropriately, femininely attractive, and I'm still affected by the shame of /not being the same-- even though I don't want to be, and have never wanted to be, pretty in that way. It's a pain in my ass, is what I'm saying. abolish beauty etc etc (but it sure would be nice if I had great skin, Ha Ha)"
"I don't really know how to appropriately compliment trans women, but I think you look great."
"omg the incel heterosexual way of saying plastic surgery"
"im only 0 seconds in but yaaaas sophie"
"There's a line from an old Spanish movie where a there was a monologue from a trans woman in which she listed her surgeries and ended with 'you are more authentic the more you resemble what you've dreamed of being'. Not to make it sound too Judith Butler-y, but aren't we all just doing that? At least some people have an authentic self to aim for."
"The results are quite subtle I won't have notice it. Anyhow you are and were gorgeous. 10 out of 10 I would smash"
"Hive mother, I am here. An unquenchable thirst for... perspective. I dropped everything.   SHHH! Listen!  She speaks."

"“Oh my god calm down” ughh Contrapoints ❤️😩💦👅 mami"
"Cum thru with the faceshopping intro sis!!"
"I'm so glad I was here for this vulnerable moment in your journey."
"It's impressive how every new video is better than the last one? Natalie has actually sized the *means of production*. Although hopefully that won't create an expectation towards every new video, cause sometimes it won't be like that I guess."
"Two things: 1) Your videos never fail to make me smile for ear to ear and laugh lots so thanks for that Natalie 😊 x💗 love ya babe 2) That Dress is really pretty and colourful and despite the fact that I wear a tshirt and jeans everyday (and never dresses) I'm curious to know, where did you get it from?"
"That intro is really amazing, I cant stop replaying it."
"You'll always be my favorite camgirl ❤"
"I wake up to see there’s a new video, I see the intro and oooo I’m so excited. The quality, the editing, I love it"
"Style is a personal brand"
"You shouldn’t rub your face with a towel, use paper towels and pat. Otherwise the dragging will roughen and wrinkle your skin faster. And paper towels are always clean compared to a towel that you have to wash daily to keep from breaking out."
"I think what you're going through is basically what a lot of women go through. They can never live up to the insane standards set by society."
"First time,longtime big fan. I've noticed a lot of flashing lights in the last couple of videos I've seen. Can you give a fellow queer a epilepsy warning so I know to tab away from the video and just listen to it??"
"Eventually, at some point in your thirties, you will stop giving a damn. The nightmares about losing your teeth, however, will continue."
"I swear, I love you for your MIND."

"I don't wear make-up and I don't look diseased. i might be fat, old and manly, but I look healthy"
"Oh my god, clicking on this video I wasn’t expecting this, but wow, you are so smart and well spoken. And BEAUTIFUL."
"Production quality gets more insane every video"
"Whose is this painting?"
"i'm not obsessed with beauty and i'm not very much of a lesbian either"
"This one I watched twice in a row! Bravo!  I have also dealt with the 'agh i wanna do silly things right now but i know i am a role model for my circle whether i want to or not in an environment that desperately needs role models,therefore i can't afford to break the whole woke journey' :p"
"'It's hard being a 6.' I never related more."
"I really think society and technology has put a lot of expectations on us. I feel that the standardisation of humans is a scary phenomenon. The problem is that the people with the most power are able to shift their image to look the most attractive, so that we worship them. Like all things this is a class issue.  White image is the image of the upper class too."
"This is so honest it's it hurts."
"I know that my opinion doesn't mean anything but the quick scenes of you sitting in front of the makeup mirror ('get out of my room, mom!') is my favourite look for you so far. I don't know what it is, you just look so gorgeous in those scenes. Also, if you haven't read The Beauty Myth by Naomi Wolf, you really should. While the statistics are probably out of date it's a wonderful book that confronts how capitalism encourages the void within us to get our fat stacks of cash. Even if you already know, it really drives it home. It really changed my life as a young adult."
"OMG you look EXACTLY like my friend Kara, she's hot btw haha"
"Lizzie got a shout out!!!! Ah!!!!!! 🤗"

"I frown upon shallow women, and others"
"This is fascinating but i think you looked better befor you had the work. Ether way you look Amazing love."
"Let yourself have a cheat day once in a while. For that one day, embrace the side of you that has no fucks left to give, pull it out of bed and blast it out through the front door right into the vacuous face of the world. Throw on sweatpants, a hoodie and a backpack and go meet some academic chicks, or someone else like that, or maybe go somewhere where no one knows you, idk. I obviously have no way of knowing for sure, but it seems that trying to be high femme constantly is like trying to hold a heavy ass pendulum at the end of it's amplitude at all times. It will wear you down. Go and swing that shit. Own that oscillation. ...oh, tiny nitpick about van Gogh. You're nailing the retching sound for the 'gh' at the end, but the 'G' is supposed to sound (almost) the same ([ɣ] and [x] are pretty interchangable). A dutchman told me once and now I'm cursed to correct everybody *forever.* Oh! and from what I've heard, sunscreen actually makes a decent foundation. But that might be bull."
"To quote Luis Cole, “when you’re ugly, there’s something you can do, fuck the world and be real cool”. I don’t say this ironically. When I first heard this song it made me cry because that’s been my whole life. “Ugly” to me is “not fitting in” and I’ve never fit in. So I just leaned into it hard and just was myself despite the consequences.  Unfortunately due to life reasons outside my control I now live in the American south instead of a rad city so I get treated like a monster when out in public. But, fuck the world and be real cool."
"Do you ever feel conscious of the m o u t h f e e l?"
"also without makeup you look kinda like simone giertz and she's cute as hell"
"Anyway also want to add that I’m a cis woman and I wish I was as hot and intelligent and good at make up and unafraid to express myself as you!"
"Honey, YOU are beautiful. Coming from a gay guy, you were fucking hot as a guy and you are fucking beautiful as a woman. You do YOU and FUCK what anyone else thinks. Really, fuck them."
"You’re so beautiful tho lol ❤️"
"Make up is way too expensive and time consuming"
"Caring about your appearance is a good sign that you're not depressed.   When I was recently seeking medical help for depression, my doctors and nurses (I live in a country with a State governed medical industry) were always asking me whether I took a concern with my outward physical appearance.  They weren't concerned about being 'shallow'. Thoughtful video, as always."
"You know what, I was going to comment on your appearance, but coming all the way through the video, I'm just more inclined to comment on your video. It's so good. I love it how you're one of the people out there who are the closest to the real answers. You're really far into this long search. And you're still smart and wise enough to openly say you don't have an answer at all."
"I believe you have a style actually, you are very trippy :)"
"bitch, I was born a woman, and you and your catty ass friends would probably say i ain't feminine enough. my face isn't professionally feminized like yours. sorry toots, but like all men, you know nothing of women, only an ideal that we human ladies fail to meet"
"When most people would use the opportunity to watch Netflix endlessly after surgery, Natalie instead chose to pyschoanalyse herself."
"So glad surgery went well 💕💐😘"
"Quality video as always Contra. That sequin top is great. Jordan Peterson is more than 10% right but in a roundabout way. Makeup in a female only environment plays on the same evolutionary ukulele as it would otherwise, and that is female dominance hierarchy (or the pretty girl pecking order as its also known.) Although if a person in such an environment is presenting themselves to those outside of that context the notion of separation hardly applies. To put it in simplest terms the old adage is still somewhat true as a general rule. 'In men, power is attractive, in women, attractiveness is power.'"

"You have great teeth and bilateral symmetry. These qualities are attractive no matter who you are. You won the lottery babe.."
"Lmaoooo I love this! Style huh? Never thought of it that way"
"thank you for this ❤"
"this is maybe some kind of addiction... beware the curse of jacko!"
"I got hooked on ContraPoints for the intellectual content but must admit that the whole beauty obsessive part has been a bit off putting since you know, the whole gender thing is made up and identity is performative. However I am an autistic shut-in who buys clothes every other year and takes a new selfie every leap year (not with my phone mind you, my phone is from 2009) so my perspective might be a bit scewed in the opposite direction. I appriciate the perspective you provide but I am struggling to sympathize."
"Even the word 'beautiful' is usually only applied to women. I have always found it oppressive to constantly have to be 'beautiful'. Not just cute or fun, no, you have to live up to being BEAUTIFUL, which is a hell of a word. It again perpetuates that the most important thing about being a women is her looks."
"Wonderful to have you back 👏👏😁"
"Damn.... that's interesting. I'm a dude with an adam's apple so fucking large, it literally negates my chin. I'm not even joking.   Maybe I should get that worked on one of these days if I get rich..."
"People don't tell us to cultivate our inner selves to be twee and condescending, they say that because putting a huge portion of your self worth into your appearance will drive you insane. Beauty is not the only thing  that gives women value: youth and fertility are your main societal value. And when those things are gone, a lot of your value goes with it, no matter how thin and well preserved you look. I'm not flattering when I say you look like a beautiful woman, even more so post surgery.  But now might be the time to do therapy because, frankly, you need it more than any further surgeries."
"umm... incels = most people????"
"I don’t really care about these things, but if we’re talking about skulls and your Ramus definitely isn’t at a right angle and it appears male, your Palate protrudes from your face and its general size gives away that your skull grew with testosterone, and there is no way to change that without essentially shrinking your head, for the Palate not to be out of relation, your orbits are too wide and too squarish for a female skull, you’ll probably need to have them changed, because they weren’t very well shaped even when you were a man, but now they just appear odd, like giant craters, the body of your Sternum is too large in relation to your Manubrium, your bones are also much longer and denser because they grew with tons of testosterone.   I’d say cosmetic surgery makes more sense with cis people, because all the basic sex characteristics of the skeleton are in order it’s really just about shaving off some bone or putting in some implants with add a few millimeters. With trans-people I understand the desire for surgery is much greater, but the needed changes are much more severe, especially for mtf because what you are trying to do is essentially shrinking the skull and underdevelop the already developed skeletal features, while ftm you can put a jawline in, have them grow a beard and you’re essentially golden, use some more implants for whatever you can think off, but no one will say that man is a woman because of an underdeveloped Inion, while a developed Inion will change the roundish appearance of the external Occipital protuberance, break the soft look of the skull contour in general, and give you that eerie feeling of talking to a man in a dress.   I like ContraPoints, but I cannot stand these disingenuous positive comments, your brain is pretty quick to say, I’d smash or I wouldn’t smash and man or woman, and certain skeletal features just give that away. Writing a overly positive comment, which is either written by A someone who doesn’t practice sexual selection for people whom they admire or B someone just straight up lying, while their brain tells them “that’s a male skull” and their moral conviction tells them “if you don’t say she’s a beautiful woman with an extremely delicate and small skull you’re a bigot”. Either way you’re essentially doing the same thing haters are doing by gaslighting the person whom you are pretending to critique."
"I was really disappointed no one laughed at my stand up last time I was here. i have never worked so hard on a comment"
"Representation for influencers! 1!1!1"
"Congratulations on the surgery. I've sometimes wondered if your medium is the message, and all the thinking is just bait to get the hordes to look? (I find watching your videos very enjoyable and am gladden each time I have the opportunity.)"
"I genuinely think you're beautiful Natalie :) <3"
"first time I ever get any reaction to anything ASMR and it's you scratching your sequins. Thanks Natalie!"
"I actually didn't recognise you at first and thought maybe a friend was starting this video xD.  The surgery's done well to enhance your femininity, congrats ^^."
"I was genuinely sad at the possibility that you might be quitting making these videos, and whilst your pretty face makes watching them more pleasant, I really am here at least as much for your wit, and thought-provoking arguments. Long may you influence!"
"Yas Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream is amazing 🔥🔥"
"I enjoy your videos, it makes me think and smile."
"After the intro alone I knew this would be GOOD"
"YAAAS SHE BACK :D!"
"'maybe lesbians are just straight chilling' can confirm lol"
"Glad to see you're back!"
"I need to hear Natalie say the word 'gracile' more. For reasons.  The reasons are that I'm a biologist and I hardly ever hear anyone else say that word and it's a good sounding word."
"More sequins... Such a great sound and colors"
"i missed you so much!!!! you look wonderful. thank you as always for sharing"
"woah, since when did juicystar07 get so artsy and intelligent?"
"I was honestly hoping this would go in depth on an analysis of SOPHIE... but still very much enjoyed the psychoanalysis."
"FFS!!"
"Don't you sometimes think you're overthinking all this? :P"
"Today a kid with Down syndrome I was treating called me ugly several times, while calling everyone else pretty or beautiful. On the premise that drunkards and children say the true, right now I'm pretty heartbroken. The kid is still adorable tho"
"Honestly I thought you were beautiful before the surgery,  and I still think you are now <3 I'm very happy that you were able to take this step in feeling more comfortable with yourself and are working towards being happy with yourself. It does look very natural. I support your choices and I thank you for being so open and sharing your experiences and opinions. I always look forward to you posting, and I think your videos do the world a lot of good."
"'What is really going through my head.'  Same Nats. Same.   Your channel continues to be an empathy machine all of its own for me."
"Getting cosmetic surgery to change the way you feel about yourself is the definition of Body Dysmorphia."
"I WANT THAT DRESS!"
"Not gonna lie, I'd love for Nat to make beauty guru style videos that start normally and just devolve into a horrific kafkaesque nightmare."
"I was writing an essay on psychotherapy treatments for mental health disorders but it has been hard to concentrate with these wonderfully articulated views on beauty, society and this level of production that would make 'the gays' exclaim 'yes gawd'. Wish your recovery well as I know results can take several months to settle."
"I too wish something unbiased / ever- truthful measure of beauty existed. Bc then at least I could except my fate and obsess over the next narcissistic thing I have no control over. I’ll reach my end goal of nihilism as the earth deteriorates. But at least I won’t wonder if I’m pretty."
"Beauty is such a weird fuzzy concept. Trying to see beauty in everybody helped me feel more comfortable in my own skin. I wouldn't call anyone else ugly to their face, so why'd I do that to myself? And once I get to know and like people I tend to think they're beautiful anyway. So inner beauty = outer beauty. Also, mainstream media may have one concept of beauty and shove their models based on that onto you... but you can go out of your way to search for other beautiful people. Look at all the old paintings full or large/fat people. Or media from around the world with (hopefully) not just white people. Or Judi Dench and never worry about age ever again. (I so hope I'll get the snow white hair of my nan when I get old...) Course that doesn't negate all the societal & political bullshit, but we can work on that eh. Revolution =( ò  。ó )= Imo style is so much more important than genetics. I have a horrible memory for faces, so I'll usually just remember people by their purple hair or cool t-shirt lol. Hahahahahahaha 'I have no Style' - ContraPoints, 2019 - Voted as greatest lie of the century."
"Jesus, the things people do to look good."

"Sander Cohen is my Iddol"
"I was never as preoccupied with beauty as the girls/women atound me always were. When I dress cute and put on make up I am more likely to get groped in public or followed around a store by a guy, sometimes a group of guys, and it's pretty scary. I already hear contrapoints saying something like 'I'd love to get that kind of attention,' these are overweight, smelly disheveled, rough looking men that I'm attracting. You have found a way to profit off of your appearance, so that I think affects your feelings about beauty."
"WHERE IS YOUR SHIRT FROM BIIITTTCCCCHHHHHHHHHhHhH give it to me"
"Am I a delusional optimist for thinking that social media and the way content creators can use their platforms so readily is a key to deconstructing those standards? Like magazines and tv would only push whatever image they wanted onto us but now we can share ourselves as we are. We can organise days to showcase hashtags of blackout or transisbeautiful etc- but then I guess the flip side to that is the homogenising impact of social media where you can quantify what is considered the most liked. And I’m not even immune to that, if I get 500 likes on one Instagram picture but can’t crack 200 on another I assume there’s something wrong with the way I look in one and something amazing and therefore valid in the other one. This is all something I blame on reading Dorian Gray in my teens and concluding that my youthful appearance was both a power and a currency who’s value was decided by how much other people liked it. But it’s not super problematic because I’m aware of it! Or does that make it worse?"
"I am a cis woman and my face has some similar features as yours had before your surgery. When I have a bad day and feel ugly I often think that I look 'manly'. So I think that`s an issue a lot of people experience."
"It reminds me of weight loss surgery. They are dangerous, expensive, life changing and often cause massive health problems..but we don't really have them for health, we do it for beauty."
"21:02 Why is no one talking about the rose fields?"
"Not gonna lie, Natalie is the only reason I keep up with the lingo kids use nowadays."
"beautiful, but i miss the old style videos, with theatre de l'absurd and weird stuff...."
"Your videos are insightful, funny and generally fantastic... and you look stunning, btw."
"Last weeks YT life lesson: 'It's rough being the rival when you think you're the protagonist.'  This week: 'it's hard being a six'  18:10 will this be a bad time to mention that I like your eyeshadow?"

"This is an amazing essay by disability activist Mia Mingus which might be a good read. She reframes ugliness as magnificence:   'The magnificence of a body that shakes, spills out, takes up space, needs help, moseys, slinks, limps, drools, rocks, curls over on itself.  The magnificence of a body that doesn’t get to choose when to go to the bathroom, let alone which bathroom to use.  A body that doesn’t get to choose what to wear in the morning, what hairstyle to sport, how they’re going to move or stand, or what time they’re going to bed.  The magnificence of bodies that have been coded, not just undesirable and ugly, but un-human.  The magnificence of bodies that are understanding gender in far more complex ways than I could explain in an hour.  Moving beyond a politic of desirability to loving the ugly.  Respecting Ugly for how it has shaped us and been exiled. Seeing its power and magic, seeing the reasons it has been feared. Seeing it for what it is: some of our greatest strength.'   I have come to find these things beautiful, through experience, just as I slowly came to find female body hair beautiful, on myself and other people, through getting used to it, and whatever other mysterious processes were at work. I have also come to find value in what I find ugly, without having to reframe it as beautiful. Of course, I still have all the hangups and judgements about my own appearance, I'm not over that and never will be, but I can honestly say that I think in 'moving towards the ugly', something fundamental has shifted for me, which is beyond which politics I want to perform and what makes sense to me in theory...  Thanks for another great video!   https://leavingevidence.wordpress.com/2011/08/22/moving-toward-the-ugly-a-politic-beyond-desirability/"

"A thought on women in academia not ~conforming to beauty standards~, when I think of lecturers that go without makeup, the ones that come to mind are largely autistic women; which is probably biased because I'm looking for people that I relate to (& am a baby stem undergrad), but I imagine their reasoning is similar to mine, and, well, yours wrt face masks: if I'm out of bed, it's probably because I'm running late to something. (so, unless a style is of particular interest, it doesn't happen, because what is executive functioning)"
"MY dysphoria is mostly tied to outside pressure. I do have some body dysphoria ever since I hit puberty, but just hiding those features helps - it's only frustrating coz it takes active effort. However, my desire to transition at all is mostly coming from other people, both strangers and family alike, not seeing me as what I am. I'm mostly happy with how I look, but no matter how I present myself, every once a while I still get reminded by someone that they seem me as the one gender I never identified as.  As a result I'm just hyper aware of what I look like when ever I'm outside with people around. At worst I have this irrational constant nagging in my head that everyone is looking at me and sees a gender I am not. I'm also nonbinary, so if ppl were not immediately defaulting to the wrong one I'd be pretty content. I just don't think that has ever happened. I'm only ever been gendered correctly online where nobody knows who I am or what I look like.  If people would have to guess and get it wrong, I'd sill feel crappy tbh. It's how I realized I wasn't just nonbinary or agender like I previously identidied as. Out of the options of man, woman or ambiguous, the only one that made me want to dig a hole and die in it every time was also the only one ppl ever saw. My language has no gendered pronouns so it's not constant, but it happens when people refer to me wrong in conversations and I generally don't feel like it's worth it to correct vast majority of them. I developed anxiety due to the combined effects my dysphoria and the pressure over becoming more conscious of how I'm seen by others.  So just telling me to be happy with how I look is not really helpful. I am mostly content with how I look, but it does not change how people react to me and my appearance on a daily basis. A social change of that level is not gonna happen overnight either, so working to abolish gender expectations is hardly comforting either."
"Great journey"
"Okay but your humor is just on point! I should've expected the Pikachu clip the second time and yet it still made me laugh as badly as the first time Also I love your purple/blue eyeshadow in this video, they contrast very nicely!"
"Mommy is back 💝💖💗"
"You are the perfect tool to make me a better person. Your videos always give a lot to think about my way of understanding human issues and i love it :D Sorry if i didn't express it properly. I know i'm not able to be cute and interesting in english - it's not my native language (greetings from Brazil) BTW, you look great!"
"Wait did an American just almost pronounce 'van Gogh' correctly. You even did one of the 'G's correctly (the last one, if you want to now. The first one is pronounced the same way), while just having had someone chip away at her Adams apple. Also this video was verry comforting for me (a 24 year old virgin with a receding hairline)   PS. This isn't the linguistic equivalent of you look great hun. This is genuine excitement. Americans are notoriously bad at pronouncing Dutch. The standard American pronounciation of 'Utrecht' has more in common with our pronounciation of 'U trekt' (Thee fapeth), then our pronounciation of 'Utrecht'."
"You look amazing 😱💖"
"I just think that if your ultimate goal is to achieve an outward physical appearance that allows you to love and accept yourself, it will never be enough. No amount of plastic surgery will change that. This sounds cliché, but beauty really is an illusion. It's like currency. It holds society together only because we continue to believe in it."
"change the society by what evolving?  I thought as a child that the next level of evolution was / is the loss of toe nails... totally useless and non-necessary ...so I pull out whole - the toe nails on my feet  to the end of them growing back for me to remove whole again... all toe nails I have removed .  *except the left big toe.. I guess nothing is perfect but they grow back ...  OH you might like this?  Then grow back deformed and I don't care as they are easier to remove whole again.. I have a video on my channel of me doing this ,,, then putting antibiotics on the hole.   but I don't know how easy it is to find as... I have too many videos to count usually  ok dug deep to find this for you ... I don't even know why?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVO4gxP7BfY    peace.."
"this isn't how beauty should work, instead of 'making yourself beautiful', i think you should think of it more like 'make beauty into yourself'"
"As a cis woman, this was really interesting! I struggled a lot with beauty standards as a child and throughout my teenage years, but as a young adolescent, I think I found a healthy balance. I only started to love my own body, when I made the choice to love it not for its beauty, but for its strength and ability to make me happy. Years after that, I found myself beautiful for the first time. Wearing make-up is a very rare thing for me, and often makes me feel estranged from myself.   Of course, I had the privilege of being born cis. I didn't have to convince anyone of my femininity, I only had to deal with people who told me I was doing it 'wrong'.  To me, by letting go of beauty as my self-defining factor, I became happier with who I am. I would recommend it to anyone who feels more and more unhappy with every effort they make to be more beautiful, but I can only speak from my perspective. I just hope that ContraPoints gets to feel good about herself,  no matter how she gets there."
"Ill take Contrapoints over Gigi Gorgeous any day <3"
"20:00 the skincare routine was hilarious, I would totally watch that daily. Who wants to have their face UN-toned??"
"Not even a second in and I hear Sophie. I know this is gonna be good."
"As usual, great video."
"Pretty sure the skin colour thing has gone/is going the other way in the UK, darker tanned skin is 100% more popular and considered more aesthetically pleasing to the point where I have a few ethnically white friends who are consistently darker than some of my friends who are from ethnically African and Middle Eastern backgrounds.   I’d say if you went on a night out in Manchester (like I did last weekend) and you see a big group of girls (12+) 1 or 2 will be definitely identifiable as an ethnicity the others will be a range of skin and hair tones/textures and you’ve basically got no chance of guessing their race if you were put on the spot.  Ultimately I think this is pretty positive as it’s definitely influenced a lot of my ‘lads’. When we were teenagers some of them would have definitely made a point out of someone else’s race or background, maybe not in explicitly negative terms but certainly in a ignorant way. This just does not happen anymore about anything and I have a feeling it’s because,in part, those beauty standards have changed (obviously they’ve also matured/grown up as well)   I can only speak from personal experience and understand that everyone has a different perspective on this issue so by no means is this meant to represent anything other than my opinion. Hopefully I didn’t offend in making my anecdotal case!"

"God I found that make-up part awkward and boring... Like it absolutely wasn't made for me.  And I didn't find any problem with that! :D"
"I have a feeling you read every single comment on here.  Loved the video! I've also found myself in this predicament. Whenever I tell people that I want to have facial feminization surgery, their knee-jerk reaction is that my face looks fine and I can pass without it. While I know intellectually that my face is androgynous and it testosterone could've done me a lot worse, I still feel like I need to change it and personally I think it's a matter of gender dysphoria not necessarily being 100% rational rather than society influencing the way I view the perfect archetype of womanhood.  Ironically this is coming from the same person who has no sense of style, relies solely on other people's perception of what it means to be beautiful and feminine and is the most gender conforming woman ever.  So yeah.. might be a mix between those. But the lines are so blurry like you said! If there's one thing I've learned it's that no matter how far you are into your transition or how gorgeous you look, The Darkness will still be there.   I guess the only thing you can do is to keep it at bay by doing whatever you feel like doing to feel beautiful, female and feminine while also going deeper than your face and challenging those pesky psychological issues."
"Does she still has a PENIS ?"

"Self affirmation makes me care less about most shit. Give yourself a confidence lift. It costs one worth while talk therapist."
"You've made me a better person Natalie!"
"While they don't usually wear makeup, I notice women in academia etc almost universally have long hair, lipstick, and earrings. They don't do alot, but they always do something. I think the whole makeup thing for women is a result of a natural hive mind and beauty standards are more along the line of a membership card. Transwomen pursue beauty because of a drive away from their male reality which is mixed with a natural desire for what makes a woman beautiful; they embody that which they want as opposed to cis men who pursue and surround themselves with what they want. Transwomen embody it internally, cis men obtain it externally. I think once you put to rest your desire for the aspects of the female that you simply cannot have, you will be satisfied with what you do have. Well done on the surgery btw. Your face looks great."

"'America needs a Contrapoints right now so I'm stuck this way.'   Alternatively: AMERICA. NEEDS. CONTRAPOINTS. *Raises fist*"
"It sorta stuck me when Natalie talked about bone structure to fit the bouncy 5'2 bio-girl. Because as a bouncy 5'2 (ok 5'1) cis girl I have always had a less feminine facial structure than her. I was probably only 12 when I first noticed that many of my facial features would be considered attractive on a man but not on me; pronounced brow, defined square jaw and chin. I also at the time had more body hair than 90% of guys my age. I still at 20 have more body hair than a lot of guys and basically every girl I've ever met. But the parts of myself that I've always disliked were the parts that make me look feminine, rather than masculine, being my height and my breast size. I like my face, and my body hair, and my muscles, as long as they aren't compared to other women. So I almost want to get away from everything that causes me to be compared to them by making myself more masculine rather than taking away those things to make myself more feminine. If it were acceptable for cis women to get top surgery for non medically nessesarily reasons I would consider it. At the same time I am definitely still a cis girl.   Ain't gender expression fun, guys?"
"If you were one of my friends I'd probably send you tons of virtual hugs and say that while I don't really know how to help I will listen if you want to talk and do the best I can. But I don't really know you so that may be awkward. I just really  like your content.  And as for getting older - ouch. That's all I can say."
"Sequines are so much fun to run hands over."

"26:40 - hell yeah, more diversity in “conventional beauty” is something any thinking cis-male would want. The more pretty girls, the better! WARNING: PERSONAL OPINION IF YOU READ MORE      My controversial opinions on Contra’s surgery:  tbh Natalie, I feel you looked more feminine/better with your previous face, at least from the front. The new face seems, for lack of a better word, plastic... but maybe it’s just the makeup. I guess the nosejob is “good” in that it does make you look more like someone destined to become a soccer mom, but again, IMO, you looked better and more feminine before. Although, your current face does look more... chill, I guess? You seem like you’re someone who’d be decent to hang out with, but needs to be kept at friend distance because of deep-lying issues that make things awkward if you get too close. It was opposite previously, someone who’d be awkward to shallowly hang out with but a top-notch conversationalist.  Oh, and you’ve been beautiful since you started trying to be. The moment I learned you were transitioning, you were already most of the way there and had already made yourself look beautiful..."
"10:00 plenty of women don't like wearing makeup and choose not to. Don't imply that women in academia are just pulling 'not like other girls' because they don't wear makeup, like Wtf."
"Miss Nat is very cute omg love it 😍 💕 Btw UVA causes ageing skin so never skip sun screen"
"Ah, this hits close to home. You can have thousands of people telling you how beautiful you are, but until you internalize it, you'll never believe it. I always say the obligatory polite 'thank you' and then come home and hate what I see in the mirror. It's exactly like you said, I know it's 'shallow', inner beauty, beauty is subjective, all bodies are beautiful blablabla and yet I desire to look like every Instagram model after an hour of photoshop. Being almost 30 and seeing my boobs slowly descend into the nightmare of sagging doesn't help either."

"Order of operations  is wrong.  Do you imagine intramasculine competitiveness is likewise not influenced by what the feminine is 'understood' to seek from masculinity?"

"I wear makeup for all sorts of reasons depending on the day. When I'm going out, I'm peacocking - I wanna try my new pallette and play around with a fun look, it's artistic. Sometimes I feel insecure as shit so I pile it on but tbh on those days makeup does zero to help me cause my brains already decided I'm gross. Sometimes I don't wear it at all. Tbh it's no one's business, but as long as its not a crutch that's exacerbating dismorphia or self esteem issues I don't see why anyone else cares.   Oh, and as for attracting a mate for sex. I already have a 'mate', and every time we have sex I have zero makeup on, so go off professor."
"We should stop this nonsense and start talking to ugly people on the bus and create a new non-esthetic world order. This beauty hierarchi is creating problems all over.   Great video though!"
"I need to know where you got that rainbow dress or my head will implode"
"As a cis woman, considered smart but never wearing make up, part of it is laziness, part of it is a superiority complex of 'not like other normies' and part of it is a genuine desire of trying to empower myself regardless of what other people think (and also most of it is that I think I look pretty good without make up). I dont iron my hair or remove my girl stache  as my personal no to racist beauty standards (I'm indian)"
"I'm not sure where beauty and confidence from beauty meet.  I lost 60 lbs, wear just a smidget less makeup then you did in this video (and by a smidget I mean I go to the look you did for fridays:)) and once those changes were there, whether it was confidence or looks (both?) Life improved significantly. From landing jobs making nearly double to being held in higher regard in the workplace... its unreal the changes beauty make."

"Look, I know you don't like Kant, but the lack of tangeable results of the fascist-fighting front is no reason to despare. After all what would one do with one's time -- not fight facsists? That's just silly. Don't fret, a solid platonic idea is still worth every utilitarian dopamine jolt and then some!"
"I love you soooo much. Please keep doing this. Go on tour! Come to Philadelphia!!!!"
"Idk I was originally socialised as a male feminist forest elf so I beat gender dysphoria without much effort, so style is all I have."

"25:00 the way to love yourself, is to love yourself. You can pressure the media to stop promoting crap beauty standards but you're better off using their crap as a springboard to remind yourself to love yourself. I had a gf who was complaining a lot which was getting me down, rather than try and change her, I decided to change the way I would respond to it. Every time she complains, I think, 'how would I handle this if I was of perfect body and mind' and I'll try to be supportive and heroic rather than be the victim of her nagging."
"You look so beautiful, inside and out Contra"
"Find Love"
"asmr for leftists"
"9:54 I'm pretty sure the main explanation is simpler than a not-like-other-girls thing.  For trans women, make-up can feel more like an opportunity - after years of the closet and dysphoria, coming into play as a means of alleviating it. cis women are a bit more likely to be sick of it because it's been forced on them from a young age. So they're just more likely to make use of an environment where there's less of an expectation to wear it."
"My makeup rutine is pretty simple, i look into the mirror and react with contempt at what i see whispering 'this is why you are single, that and that you are a weird weird human' shed a tear to moisen my complexion then cry in the shower.  but yours seems less emotionally crushing so  i might use some of it to improve mine."
"Anyone else think Natalie kinda looks like young Celine Dion? We stan a diva <3"
"Different strokes for different folk. I personally find more beauty in those academic ladies that don't wear make up. I'm not attracted to glam in any way, in fact I would classify myself as... Um, anti-glam? glamphobic? Critical of Glamification?    Fake nails, eyelashes, heels, excessive jewelry, tattoos, piercings or any kind of cosmetic surgery are things that not only I consider unpleasant but have a direct aversion to. Of course I believe in anyone's fundamental freedom to do as they please with their appearance but it is not something that I would encourage, support or validate in any way.   Hence my big roadblock with glamorous transexuals, I find this type of entitlement towards beauty to be quite reprehensible on anyone regardless of gender, I do see it as simple vanity. And I feel very strongly about that...   Keep doing the good work with your videos, they are very educational for old fashioned people like me who hope to at least understand other perspectives."
"When I was directed to your first video from SuperEyepatchWolf about incels I didn't realize you were trans. I thought you looked lovely then and you look lovely now. You do seem a little more comfortable with yourself and confidence is always a great beautifier. We all do what ever is in our power to look better. Right now I have half my hair curled around a head band and the other half in two braids with a granny foam curler on each end. Combine that with my read hair,, and I look like a cross between Sansa season 1&2 and a deranged Pippi long stalking, but it's worth it because tomorrow I will have the flowing locks of a Celtic Goddess. Thank you for being you, I always really look forward to your videos."
"I meant to say, You are not alone. What you are going though, Billions of women worldwide go through it. Dissatisfaction with their image."

"I don't want to be beautiful, I want to be handsome!"
"This dress, the makeup, the hair, SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL 💔"
"Omg you look like Celine Dion with that makeup, ugh goddess <3"
"I was going to say, are you going to do a video on Style, but looks like not. I only realized it recently that the reason women (cis, trans etc) want beauty so that they can be treated with some level of dignity and respect. If you don't meet the beauty standards then you are more likely to be despised, disrespected, not taken seriously etc."
"I don’t comment on your videos much (probably haven’t ever before) but I just wanted to tell you that I’ve always thought you’re insanely beautiful. I didn’t even know you’re trans until you said so. That being said, I’m glad you did something for yourself that makes you feel better about your self image. You are intelligent, funny and iconic and I wish nothing but the best for you. ❤️  Also, I bet you’ll age into one fine older woman. 😘"
"Dear Ms. Winn,  Thank you for your candor, transparency, and humo(u)r.  By way of introduction:  https://voat.co/v/GreatAwakening/3235624/18766624  With respect, sincerity, and an absence of sarcasm.  A filthy, *filthy* q"
"*Looks at all the before and after photos of Contrapoints.  .............huh. Neat.  *Goes back to his day."
"the surgery could not be just 'to look more female' since I'm a cis woman with a forehead like you had. The forehead part is extra."
"Part of people going gaga over the looks of anyone they're fans of is just human psychology: People you like look better, people you hate look like three rocks and a pair of googly eyes. It's weird as shit, but it's a thing. It works so well that you can find someone who looks like you in some specific way (someone you don't want to murder with an axe), eventually start to feel like they're maybe a deity of beauty that was punted out of the stars, look in the mirror and accidentally not be horrified at the sight."
"I stan."
"You looked better before, like anime fantasy tranny better. But now I'm just bored with your face. Now you're a basic bitch tranny. *yamn*"

"That intro...is amazing"
"I'm a lesbian and I'm definitely straight chillin' when it comes to my appearance, but when it comes to the rest of my life I'm a fucking mental dumpster fire"
"We all love you a huge amount, hope you feel better soon 💜"
"You are looking absolutely gorgeous! You go girl.😀"
"You were beautiful, when you were still a man."
"My daddy dom 💀💀💀"
"I watch your videos while I do my makeup so this was a trippy one  P. S. Sit on my primed face mommy"
"So happy to see you back!"
"I appreciate the Fear and Loathing reference"
"I had to pause this video for 2 minutes to laugh at 'hi sistercels' 😂😂😂😭😭😭😭"
"That was a pretty depressing video for me. I recognize that drive, that striving for more (more beauty, more money, more success etc. etc.) that never actually gives you any genuine satisfaction. Is the answer just not to ever achieve anything if all of this leads to ultimately nothing? That would be easy, that would take very little effort, especially if there is a way not to starve to death by not achieving anything. Still it leaves you empty and apathetic, so that's not a very satisfying answer either. Is human condition just pain? Do people around me just pretend to be fine while they suffer like I suffer, like we all suffer? Damn."
"man, as a really young cis woman, it just feels like everyone's in a mariokart level to reach the beauty standard finish line, and I just hit 12th place as Bowser.  Like, here I am, dieting and exercising and finally being free of my acne, and I think, 'Wow, I think I look great!' and then everyone's like 'we're doing face bone surgery now.' LIKE Y'ALL SLOW DOWN, LET ME CATCH UP PLEASE. All of my friends watch beauty guru make up channels, and I can't do make up except for occasions because it gives me really bad acne."
"If you start with SOPHIE I'll like the video, no matter what."
"'Because I'm trapped in a doom spiral' Same"
"When I started folowing you a few months ago I didn't notice you were transgender, if this means something to you, then I saw a video of you talking about it. Maybe is because I am Spanish and I don't really distinguish English accents and voices but you know, you looked great and you look great now. I love your videos ♡♡♡"
"I live near Baltimore and if I ever saw Nat in a bar I would buy her whatever drink and high five for being so cool + good"
"Not had FFS, but keep getting told I look like Jamie Lee Curtis or Annie Lennox...erm, thanks,I guess, looking like women who've been dogged by rumours of being Trans for decades is,well...... its a mixed blessing lets just say."
"I don't know how about all you, but I feel like this problem of not knowing whether or not you're pretty, beautiful yourself  applies to most people. Like, when I, a straight cis man, look in the mirror I just... Don't know? I feel like I just can't judge my own looks on an average day. Hm."
"THANK YOU! as a manly specimen who's hoping to get her smarties soon I feel so guilty for wanting to look beautiful and feminine by societies standards and I feel that a lot of the trans community makes it out like i'm a bad person for that! I just want to look outside how I feel on the inside, society has a role to play in that but I still make the final decision, it's still my body, my appearance and I wanna look how i want to look.   It makes me laugh that people talk about how women use makeup, plastic surgery etc etc for them, how it's not to attract men. But the moment a trans woman wants to do the same it's all 'no you're transphobic stay ugly you fucking troll'"
"You pass. Best regards, Chad Straightman"
"I was reading Salem's Lot and feeling slightly unsettled from classic Stephen King. I decided to stop for the night as a storm was starting to rage and it would be good to sleep in it - I like the sound of the rattling roof above.  I figured I'd brush my teeth and get ready to sleep with some youtube and to my delight I see ContraPoints! Hooray. This is a good day.   *AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*   Alright, guess I can wait until a little later to sleep. Preferably when the Sun's up..."
"FINALLY.  I don't wanna endorse the capitalist demand-supply narrative, I'm just saying: Demand was there.  Thanks for the new video."
"Looking forward to videos that are not about gender!"
"I usually not comment on people body, but, it's the topic, isn't it ?  I miss your nose.  I don't like big nose. I preferes small noses like your new one. I thing aquiline noses are not sexy and don't look at them.  BUT.  I saw you with pleasure during monthes and that may me accustome to your nose.  And, step by step, I learn to love it the way he was. To see his quality, how it fit with the slenderness of your face.  And find it beautifull at the end. I like it when habituation make me move my beauty standard.  The 30 years old me don't find the same physicals features beautifuls than the 13 years old me. And it's not insicerity nor settle for something less good but easier to get. It's just ...  As a child, the only 'beauty' I know was my dolls. Then, I needed to see new things several times and associate to people I like to considere the new thing  is 'beauty'. It's begane with actors and actresses : I see them many time in positive way so I understood 'this is pretiness'. Then, the same thing with real life friends. etc etc. Until my beauty standard enlarged.  And you enlarged my nose appreciation standards.  By the way, you should ask to women in academic field why they don't make up instead of assuming than it's too 'loke more masculine to be taken seriously' because I thing that you're wrong with this one.   Women journey about beauty is long and complicated, and 'no make up' is a step on the journey of womanhood you're not already came throught. But it's a sweet and liberating one and I promess you'll be enjoy it when you will live it.  It's always a pleasur to see your vidéos.   Moreover, youy sond work on this one was very, very good !  All the best, Caroline."
"Please, make russian subs."

"Old age (which is not far away), is gonna hit you like a truck."

"The first three minutes of that was disturbing in a way that reminds me of those weird indie horror films from eastern europe. Are you on drugs?"
"Have you ever heard of the book Psycho-cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz? Maybe give it a read... I do think you've always been pretty, and very attractive to me."
"I'm a cis guy who's also bi and I am fatter than ever. Just turned 27 and I was, in hindsight, very cute and kinda sexy. Nowadays I think of my 20 years old self and my desire is to have the self confidence of my present self in my late teens body. But the truth is: I hated myself back then too. Maybe even more than I do now, precisely because I, to put in Contra's words, FORGAVE MYSELF about wanting to be (and feel) beautiful. Does anybody else feel this way?  PS: please, come to Brasil. Haha"
"SHE'S A WOMAAAAAN"
"Wow I can't believe the timing of this video, I was just thinking about this the other day and it was really incredible to hear your perspective.  I'm a cis woman in my 30s and I've never worn makeup on a regular basis. I find that now, for the first time, I have more financial means to explore using makeup, and I am struck by the desire to do so.  So many things that you touch on this video play into this desire and I have been questioning my own motivations.  Is it valid to suddenly want to put time, effort, and money into what is essentially a corporate sand trap that thrives on people feeling bad about how they look, and directs them to pour resources into their appearance rather than into other things? How much of this desire to participate in beauty culture comes from wanting to explore artistic creativity and style, and how much is it wanting to protect my aging self from criticism amidst an ocean of messages that an old women are pathetic and dismissable?  Can I trust my own feelings and reactions towards these things?  Is it SHalLoW? Even if it is shallow, is it wrong to pass that judgement on it? Can I just enjoy things without digging deeper or is that irresponsible? In full honesty, I don't think I can earnestly and accurately pick apart even my own motivations; society's influence runs too deep.  Basically the realization that I've come to, is that conventional beauty IS privilege.  Some people, more than others, have effortless access to this privilege.  Regardless of my conscious motivations, if I start to wear makeup, I will be actively accessing that privilege.  I think this applies to anyone who tries to enhance their appearance in order to align more closely with societal standards for beauty--the desire to access more privilege is folded in.  And that's...understandable?  Certainly it is understandable for trans women to use tools like makeup to access as much cis-passing privilege as they can, since that has tangible consequences for their safety and happiness.  In general, it is understandable to want to be rewarded for your appearance by the world at large, if that is within your ability. I am certainly extremely privileged to be able to be treated humanely and civilly without wearing makeup (were this not the case, I surely would have been using it a lot sooner), but there is no question that wearing it would bring with it a whole new set of experiences and opportunities, both good and bad.  I think it's valid to be curious about that.  But I also think at least for me, it's important to be aware that accessing privilege is what I'm doing when I strive to be more 'beautiful', and to carry that awareness when interpreting the reactions and feedback I get.  This video was so validating in the idea that 'beauty is complicated'.  It is not simply shallowness, self-expression, a hobby, or a tool.  You cannot simply make an expression decision without it having rippling implications for your life.  And honestly that's...really annoying.  But, all that aside, I want to say thank you for the videos you make, every single one is a masterpiece <3"
"Is this something cis women do?   I could do with a more feminine face.  You look gorgeous btw"
"These videos are slowly becoming less and less relatable, makes me feel so sad lol"
"Umm but can we please also get a makeup tutorial? That was a fucking look"
"This is fantastic"
"I related so hard to this video; having a receding hairline and thin hair at 22 eats away at me and my self-confidence. It's something I wish I could afford to change, but all I can do is make the best of what I have and try to accept it. Easier said than done..."
"Natalie, you're always beautiful to matter what. <3"
"'Like, you've been with me since the beginning.' Hello.  I have been around since the Youtube Atheist days.  I *actually* have been here since the beginning.  You were so cute back then with your luxuriously flowing hair.  Then you cut it, and I was sad.  But now it's baaaaack!!"
"Natalie, as usual, made me think about my own experiences with beauty and cosmetics in relation to my own transition.  My personal expression of beauty is influenced by western ideals and capitalist fuckery, but I still enjoy wearing makeup because it makes me more visually appealing and more importantly, it makes me feel pretty. It gives me an emotional boost and allows me to feel closer to the traditional feminine aesthetic."
"Fwiw, the left is definitely NOT a fine-tuned critiquer of ableism. They do not give a flying shit about ableism. It's always just added onto the list when people list '-isms', and it's considered controversial because while being e.g. not white is not intrinsically bad, being disabled IS intrinsically bad (sans social model of disability), therefore it's right to -ism against it (because nowadays '-ism', to overzealous white queer SJW millenials, is more 'unfair preference/affiliation' than 'outright physical harm and exclusion'). I can't remember the last time I actually saw something harming or obstructing disabled people (not, like, abstractly, but like 'Hey if I ask if there are stairs into the LeftFest 2019 Undisclosed Secret Venue could someone try to find out before I travel 4 hours to get there with a wheelchair, and not be mad that I asked?'). (Note: I'm not a chair user, it's just an example. I am disabled though and my bf is a chair user so I hear the complaints.) I understand that stuff is not going to be physically accessible for minorities and I accept it, I just want some basal acceptance that I'm not going to physically harm myself on purpose and that that's rational self-interest."
"I relate to this video a lot. I don't wear makeup, mostly by virtue of never having started so I have no clue what I'm doing, but every once in a while the thought crosses my mind and I immediately shut it down out of that fear of looking like I'm trying. I found your admittance to want to be beautiful really sort of helpful for myself, since I tend to feel bad about wanting the same thing. Maybe I'll finally pick up some eyeshadow and learn what toners actually do!"
"Love it, but a little flash warning for the intro would have been appreciated."

"Have you read the beauty myth by Naomi wolf?"
"The music in this video was truly among the best."
"Girl, you look amazing! I always loved dressing up, looking sharp and stylish but I've been told that it is a distraction because it keeps the focus away from my work (especially when I'm presenting) and puts the main focus on my body, which is something I don't want. Since I, unfortunately, cannot change the mind of others, I have to tone down my wish to look and feel glamorous in order to work in peace. My workplace doesn't allow me to stand out and it's best for me to 'blend in' with everyone else in order to present a coherent image of the company I work for rather than expressing my individuality. Nevertheless, I think it is amazing that you are able to express yourself in that way and I strongly believe that all women can benefit from women like you, who show that we can have it both: intellect and beauty. You are not only able to use your looks to highlight your points but you also perfected it and I admire you for that!"
"Im bulgarian :)"
"she looks absolutely stunning, i want what she‘s having"
"I turn it on and i hear sophie. This is gonna be fun."
"The problem is that PRETTY IS NOT A FEELING. Both the person in the body and the people outside believe it is which is disastrous for all. To assume that someone feels a certain way (pretty) because of how their bodily aesthetic effects our eyes is ridiculous and does not reflect truth in the least. To assume that rearranging our body parts will provide us with a whole new and more pleasant set of feelings (of which pretty is not one) is ridiculous too."
"Natalie where did that top come from and does it come in   b  o  i  sizes for me, it's fabulous."
"Did you  make this in like 2 days or was the timing of the Tati James charles thing an amazing coincidence?"
"Satre said hell was other people without a mirror. You look great."
"You seem happier despite expressing having a hard month. Think you're on the right track, focusing on style instead of beauty. (speaking from my experience with dysphoria as ftm) I find that I feel better about myself if I think about how I act and dress masculinely rather than how feminine my body is. Focusing on my 'style' as you call it vs traditional male beauty standards."
"As a female student who has no money at all i know that my beauty belongs to my capital. And i cant let go of that bc i know that without investing in it i would have less opportunities less attention so i simply cant effort to 'let myself go' . Mist of my collueges in university  never wear make up  and dont seem to care as much.     I hope  this makes sence im from Germany i cant speak englsh perfectly"
"“Beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty.”  In this mans opinion, your mind is your most beautiful quality. Thank you for giving us a glimpse inside again with this aesthetically pleasing video."
"This is the realest video I’ve maybe ever seen on this website. Thank you so much for your honesty and insight. With regard to “what to do next” - have you thought about a spiritual practice? I know it sounds so stupid and I’m not suggesting any religion or practice in particular but to be honest it’s been huge for me in terms of shifting my self image away from what I look like towards what I’m doing and experiencing."
"Listen Natalie, you can raise the bar on absolute hotness as far as you want, but im still going to come to your fountain for your killer sense of humor and insanely on point introspective honesty."
"You honestly look amazing- personally I’m against plastic surgery and I’d never want it myself but you’re very brave to go through with it!"
"i wonder if surgeons can cut some bone from thighs and put it on my shoulders so my ass and shoulders would look more masculine lmao"
"Look, I don't know how to say this tactfully, but if you really think your fans say that you're beautiful or that you pass perfectly because they just want to flatter you, then you really need to at least think about your stance on psychiatrists again, because you might need therapy for that level of insecurity.  Like, I don't know who you're measuring yourself against, but if it's someone like Ariana Grande (is she someone people consider a standard for femininity or beauty these days?), then you're never going to look like her, because 1) not even Ariana Grande looks like Ariana Grande most of the time and 2) you have entirely the wrong body type for that.  But let me tell you a secret, my second celebrity crush ever was Céline Dion back in the 90s (so in her late 20s-early 30s), and you already looked almost exactly like her before your surgery. In fact, my first crush was Winona Ryder, and looking at her pictures from when she was around 30, you don't look all that different from her either. So please stop selling yourself short."
"I think you are subjectively and objectively attractive/beautiful. I found this video to be quite self centred, you have to define your beauty, no one else. Through accepting yourself the beauty shines through. Your description of style is really good however.  I guess being a youtube star is very lonely, I hope you find your beauty!"
"More like mental health counts 23:02 so why isn't this body identity dysmorphia with a lot of societal influence 7:02 ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHLRiu6Uy8I  18:15 is totally offensive as a real biological woman. You were born male and yet you didn't own it. Such a shame. Or you could become a wise person and change yourself you did state that your not happy even after the surgery. How about a therapists?"
"21:30 - self loathing over your beauty is a pretty feminine practice. Guys are much more kind to themselves, I do 10 push ups a week and I feel like Adonis"
"You're beautiful. You're gorgeous. You look like Linda Evangelista!"
"I love your work. Congratulations on your surgery."
"I'm sorry you feel stuck in the ContraPoints pigeonhole :( I hope you find something to inspire you again. <3 I think you look beautiful."

"Style. God I get it. Started as a gothic higschooler, and am now  'hipster', 'gothic-ish' 'Santa Fe chic', whatever who wears corsets to work. I'm on point. I have no idea if I'm beautiful. But I've got style for days. And I do cling to it in the most unhealthy way possible."
"Bravo Nicely done"
"didn't youtube give you a plaque celebrating 500,000 subscribers?  that should provide a lift of the spirits, no? i've been watching for about a year and a half, and as a first time commentor (perhaps only time) i must tell you your essays make my brain buzz, (in a good way) mainly because there is so much information to absorb, and my brain IS prone to buzzing (my favorite moments-the look on your face when you were stroking your sequins, 'capitalism gone a-mack', 'van gocccchhhhhh'(cough)-twice. thank you. see you later."
"Watched this while shaving my legs in the bathtub so I don’t look like a disgusting butch lesbian when I have to label myself a femme sub, the successor of Aphrodite. The only way other girls will know Im a dainty sub is if I’m completely hairless from the forehead down!! (Or a cute little heart pube moment)"
"That intro was... an experience. Amazing video as always!"
"Fuck being trans is hard. I wish it wasn't this hard for you."
"Love your work. Not a fanboy that I would lie but trust me, you're definitely good looking and don't stress yourself out too much."
"A lot of human through history have worn makeup. Our society has made it a sexist thing, but wearing colorful stuff on your face is human culture, so there is no need to feel to guilty about it. Unless you're going for the no makeup makeup look, in case... just wear a red lip, live a little, come on!"
"That start reminds me a lot of American horror story"
"The first video of ''Contrapoints'' i watched was ''Incels'' and to be honest i thought she was a 30 something woman with a very Camp aesthetic."

"10:10, did Natalie really miss that grad students don't spend hours of their week on makeup and beauty because it's time consuming when you're studying?"
"i started crying when you pronounced vincent van gogh right. i've never heard an american pronounce it right before. these are tears of happiness. thank you natalie.... you've made a dutch girl very happy"
"Natalie, some women genuinely just don’t care. I’ve learned not to care.  It has nothing to do with rejecting or impressing anyone.  Not all cis women who don’t wear make up are being “not like other girls”.  It is possible to ignore this shit.  But maybe the way you’re living now, that seems impossible to you?  I don’t like the way you characterised those cis women, because I am one of them, and what you said wasn’t correct."
"If contra's production values get any higher they are going to have to start screening these videos in theatres."
"Just goes to show that we can't see our own beauty. Our self-image is fundamentally more critical than other people's image of us."
"I know the details are different to a trans person's experience, but the core thesis hit close to home with body dysphoria/dysmorphia of some gay men chasing a hyper-masculine ideal of beauty. Myself and other gay men I know carry around this mental baggage. Often times we will go to extreme length to also chase the same dragon. Surgery, hormones (anabolic steroids), extreme lifestyle changes and the same level of self loathing looking in the mirror are pretty common.    Now I'm going to go fetal in the corner and babble about how I can't be like Bara-bae."
"'Isn't it safer to fall in love with them while quietly dying inside'  I hate how relatable that is"
"who will speak for the fats?"
"I vote that Natalie just uploads an hour of her scraping her sequins looped"
"I feel like you really have body dysmorphia problems and should talk more with a psychologist, yes your surgery was great and made you more beautiful but you already state yourself it hasn't taken away the nagging feeling you have. p.s. not a hater I just don't want you to turn into the bogdanoff brothers."
"I'm a cis woman and have never been very interested in make-up. Mostly because I can't be fucked. I do have problems with self-image but strangely enough I just now accepted that I'm not Instagram pretty, will never be and I will have to spend so much time to attain that level of beauty that I just can't be fucked. I don't know, you will probably change your POV when you're older. I certainly did. But if you don't, just make sure at least you're having fun making yourself look pretty. Good luck with the recovery :)"

"What I appreciate is CP's willingness to say, 'The world is messy and full of contradictions, and so am I. I don't have easy answers about anything, including myself.'  So many of the alt-right/intellectual dark web types today peddle glib, pat answers to complex questions."
"Yo, that intro was aaaa-mazing!"
"Natalie be honest with us, when will you move in with Olly from Philosophy tube and start your reign as the ultimate aesthetic overlords of youtube?"
"It doesn't come from Patriarchy. It comes from the need of aligning the way you look with the Platonic Ideal of yourself. You will never reach that ideal (since it is imaginary and cannot be attained in the changing, material world) but you can be closer to it. Beauty is inherently good, which means you should pursue it. Perfection can never be reached, but it can be chased. Thus, 'changing society' will not fix this problem since it has nothing to do with society. It also cannot be changed because the standards of beauty are eternal and unchanging."
"Natalie you look amazing. Congratulations on a successful surgery. May your recovery be swift. Much love from Texas."
"I really want that top."
"10:05 Ive had several women in uni proudly declare to me that they cant cook at all. Good on you for defying gender steriotypes......I guess?"
"U look amazing like always, love the sequins shirt, love from Italy ♥️"
"Not knowing whether or not you're attractive when you look in the mirror is normal. You're only gonna think you're attractive when you alter your appearance enough that your brain doesn't recognize you as 'you' right away. Like, the only time I ever think I'm hot is when I shave my beard for the first time after 3 months. When I keep shaving regularly... nothing.   So try not to put too much value on how attracted you are to yourself, you weirdo."
"Have you read the book 'The Look of a Woman' by Eric Plemons? It's a medical anthropological approach to FFS."
"I don't care about some bone surgery (which looks great btw) or facial validation, i'm here for the philosophy content, and i'm in dire need of a contrapoints episode Natalie would have had more time to work on now tha there is no medical recovery to hinder it."
"Oh, sweet Jesus. I wrote my previous comment telling you that you're beautiful when I was about seven minutes into your video. And for real, you are (like seriously, you're gorgeous). But....  After watching the rest of it, I feel like telling you some things. And just to let you know, a whole rant is coming up. Also, I'm drunk, so sorry if all this seems a little ham-fisted because of that.  I'm a 38 year old cis-gendered straight man. I had bariatric surgery when I was 33 because I was tired of being fat. It didn't have anything to do with wanting to be sexually attractive to others (I was, and am, happily married to a woman that would love me even if I weighed a thousand pounds). I was tried of looking at my naked body in the mirror and feeling shame.  So I had the surgery. I lost weight. And....I still feel shame when I look at myself in the mirror.  Yeah, I'm not as fat as I used to be, and can never be again. It still doesn't mean that I don't still see what body fat I have in the mirror and think, 'WHY ARE YOU SO FAT?!'  As far as YouTube celebrities go, I look at the Buff Dudes. Jesus Christ, one of them just broke his foot and had to stop working out for three months, and he STILL LOOKS BETTER THAN ME ON MY BEST DAY! Why in the fuck can't I have six pack abs!? Why can the blond guy from Buff Dudes end up with a serious injury and still look more fit than me!? Why are you so fat, JLotus? Don't you even lift?   And just like you, I have people on social media telling me I look great. And just like you, I assume they're all full of shit (although I certainly don't have, nor deserve, the social media following that you have).  And there's also the age thing. I'm almost 40. Jesus Christ, I'm almost 40. Every new birthday from here on out is just going to remind me that I'm getting less strong, less fit, and less likely to be that way.  Anyway, I'm not saying any of this to try to take away your thunder. Far be it from me as a white, cis-gender hetero dude to even think I have the right to do so. I'm just writing this to let you know you're not alone.  Regarding the end of your video, yeah, the world really does need ContraPoints. You're a hero, whether you want to be or not.  Anyway, rant over. Hopefully the replies to this won't be too harsh. I do have feelings, after all!"
"Congratulations on your surgery Natalie, you look wonderful! 😀 I thought you looked brilliant and lovely anyway but it's not about what I think.  I'm loving the sequinned garment! 😀Xx"
"I have personally given up on getting into makeup because I cry so much daily that it would be a lot of wasted money and unnecessary support for sexist ableist racist capitalist corporations. So I have found a way to appreciate my salty tear-stained visage, because it reminds me of the inherent eroticism of the seas."
"first of all how DARE you pronounce van gogh like that"
"16:20 fucking same tho"
"your so pretty x"
"Okay I know this probably wouldn't mean much to Natalie, but I'm always surprised at how pretty people are without makeup. Maybe I'm just really gay"
"Goblin swine #5 for you."
"You are amazing"
"You can't admit that the leftist 'patriarchy' and all this other Postmodernist deconstructionism is all B.S. If you raise 80 kids with no social conditioning and put them all together when they reach the age of 18, you'll see the same standards of 'attraction' as exist today. The girl who tries shaving her legs and armpits will find that the non-socially-programmed boys find this more attractive, and even the girls will find it more attractive, because it's not social programming - it's natural urges, and it's the wiring of our brains. Standards of attraction have remained stable for millennia. Why can't we just be honest? I have bad teeth, and I will fix my bad teeth ASAP. I don't say, 'Class privilege has made people view coffee-stained teeth as less attractive than white teeth.' My grill is effed, and that's ugly. So what? I'll do my best to fix it, but I don't have anyone more to blame than Mother Nature and Starbucks for the fact that coffee stains on teeth are ugly. You want to be a pretty, big-breasted OC girl, so you're trying to be one. That's cool - you do you, and I wish you well. Heck, if you get there, and if I fix my grill, we might be banging someday, and then all this P.C. postmodernist pedantic garbage will just be a kinky backdrop to some extremely dehumanizing activities that get both of us off. Just admit that you're essentially an over-literate Republican, because you're misleading a bunch of people with all your 'Revolution' nonsense, and you're not going to be a good brick-thrower with all of the estrogen you're taking. Fact is, we're all sort of gross, and the best we can do is try to minimize the damage we do to one another, and maximize the good. The answer isn't in right-wing or leftist ideology, but in common human decency, and in facing reality for what it is rather than trying to evade reality with clever rhetorical maneuvers."
"Ok, we’re the same age but I’m cis, and honestly I just stopped caring about other people thinking I’m pretty. It’s not about trying to be more masc/less trivial. It’s honestly just 1. Self-acceptance, 2. Acceptance that trying to control other people’s perception of me is pointless & 3. Make up takes time & I’m late.   I really think it’s mostly that I only had one adolescence to go through & I don’t go out a ton. Yeah it’s fun to glam up sometimes but I don’t feel any anxiety about it all anymore.   What I’m saying is, don’t worry, it gets easier."

"'In a society' posting is at least six moths old you boomer"
"I deleted my first comment, not because it wasn't true or whatever, but because by the end of the video I was wallowing in the _I wish I looked half that pretty_ mode I seem to get into everyday, and that seems more on topic. I relate to this feeling of only feeling pretty once a month, but lately it seems more like once a season. I've no idea how to ever change that feeling, since as the years go by, I grow older just like we all do. The harm comes from the comparison though. If I could just stop comparing my looks to others (even to my younger self)."
"Why does not one talk about bone structure"
"I kinda wanna see Contra play D&D as a male Bard the same way most groups play bards"
"If I ever become a part of academia, I’ll try to be super feminine not cause of any real attachment to it but just cause of a pathological contrarianism heh heh"
"Holy shit Natalie, you look like Jenna Marbles!"
"I think I am going to miss your old face, but mostly your old nose. However; I hope you love your new bone shapes. I love your video's and I can't wait to see more."
"But straight trans girls do tend to care more about conforming to femininity than lesbian trans girls. Actually this is true of cis women too. So male versus female ideas about beauty is a factor, as well as wanting to be sexually desirable.  Although it is also true that we look feminine because we like it, and not just to attract guys. Like most things it's a complicated mixture of stuff I guess"
"God this video could have been done by my boyfriend..."
"Oh neat"
"Never stop being yourself! The world NEEDS a Contrapoints even if we don't deserve one. All of your tears and struggles have not gone to waste. You are BEAUTIFUL because you have OVERCOME all the hate and you continue to prove your EXISTENCE and WORTH. If we are just ghosts in shells then your outer outer beauty is YOURS to define and improve on. The feeling of not being beautiful will NEVER go away because there will always be MORE to improve on. If all it took was a surgery for me to feel beautiful and complete I might as well just die right after it because there would be nothing left to do. Your entire 'journey' (lol) is what makes you aesthetically pleasing. Please, PLEASE never stop striving to improve on/discover who you really are. Imma make one final comparison using those 'generic heterosexual terms', would you rather date a 7 that used to be a 4, or a 8 that was always an 8? If it were me I would chose the 7 because that 7 will probably die a 10 and that defying the odds is a part of who that person is. Also lesbians do care about appearance (so everyone?) the aesthetic is just different. That is all. Amen."
"completely 100% honest sometimes when you talk you look kinda like blake lively"
"Well, this solidifies to me that I need to get surgery done. I'm going to be up all night now."
"Damn that before and after looks like one of them phtoshops of an incel into a chad"
"So women in their natural state (without makeup, fake lashes or nails...) are masculine or just try to be special? Hm"
"Here, have some dopamine: I already thought you looked attractive, but this new skull of yours is stunning. And your style bouquet in all the different personas is an inspiration for me to push my own style further, and accept that wanting to wear make-up doesn't have to be 'giving in to patriarchy' if I like the way it looks."
"Step on me, Mommy."
"Them millimeters of bone"
"I really wish I knew someone like you IRL."
"A lot of women have image issues. Try finding one nice thing about your image and acknowledge that. Its a small step to better self image. I'd suggest acknowledging the fact you have a beautifully expressive face and lovely eyes."

"BULGARIAN ROSE WATER FTW! Sorry, I just love when people mention my country in a positive light."
"Jesus i so get you. I very often only open grindr to get the positive yes I want to fuck you messages and then pretend I hate them 😂 feeling pretty sexy and so forth is so different from on some. level knowing you're lucky with your looks. I know I'm very lucky and yet I feel pretty damn unsexy (don't forget we men aren't allowed to be pretty, that's for girls, thanks social norms) most of the time...."
"Hey, you're uploading in 4K now, I knew the image was sharper! Looking great!"
"I genuinely don't have the words to express how much I appreciate this video."

"You really should make ASMR videos, Natalie."
"Regarding the 'what are we supposed to do' after critiquing the insanity of our collective conditioning: why not just do nothing? Everything is crazy, the system has gotten in my head and everything I do is based on ideas and premises designed to subjugate and control. So I guess it's just time to stop doing shit. I mean do what ur gut tells u, your intuition but obviously all our thoughts are crazy, shouldn't be believed or followed and just veil the simple harmony of it all"
"im watching this as i go to my victimology class without any make up on (and my skin is Bad and the pimples are Prominent) for the first time in uhhh a year?? the meta of it all is that I'm a victim of beauty because it's not for me most of the time :/"
"This one hits close to home for me. I can really identify with the feelings you talk about, I'm cis and as a teen I remember feeling like I wasn't 'girl enough' because of my acne and feeling ugly all the time. It's true what you say about style, It can be a powerful tool to cope with all that. All the love Natalie!"
"I wonder what Frida Kahlo would say about this obsession with beauty..."
"You looks like a nerd"
"Natalie, I don't know if this will help or not but I will speak my truth."
"The first  ever video of you I've watched was the one about incels and you definitely 'passed', all I thought was 'whoa what a gorgeous woman speaking smart things'. I started watching your other videos and eventually got to the older stuff. I was confused, like, who is that person? Someone else, some guy? Took a while to realize you are trans. You are gorgeous and beautiful and got so much better at make up,  I wish you all the best!"
"eh you're pretty, you smart dum. just to be extra confusing. Never forget beauty is in the eye of the disgusting many eyed beholder P.S interesting video I enjoyed it."
"This points out a unique no-win situation for the trans community - loneliness via social exile for not putting in enormous effort to 'pass' or living with the fear that you aren't being authentic by trying so hard. Both are worse for trans women who have the added societal pressure of even narrower expectations on acceptable femininity. At least as a woman in a traditionally masculine career, I can get by with minimal criticism because its at least 'respectable work'.  Anything even associated with women has to be re-branded from as much as possible, whether it be incels (looks maxxing) or TERFs (anti-glam). I think a large part of the reason that she may have been depressed even after working so hard to feel beautiful is that there really is no brand of womanhood that can meet all external expectations of who a beautiful woman is. The only way to win is focusing on those internal feelings. Those moments she has once a month are all by herself when no one is watching! That confidence in itself is beautiful, and practicing that joy in every day life goes a long way in making you more beautiful to everyone else (except maybe to the TERFs and incels - who really aren't worthy anyway). Thank you for this ContraPoints I wish you the best ❤️"
"That Sophie in the beginning ❤️ also the video production level JUMPED."
"Have a dopamine hit. I think you're beautiful :)"
"As a woman in academia who does not wear make-up, I can tell you that 90% of why I don't is just that I don't have the mental or physical energy to care about how I look."

"16:57 I know, it’s very annoying!"
"Be the change you want to be. If you want to subvert the mainstream aesthetics don't 'play it safe' by trying to first make it societally acceptable and then changing. Change when it's still taboo."
"Is this a video about the perfect angel Nat creating beauty, choke me mommy?"
"You looked nice as a guy back then... but you're embracing the new, feminine you so well now, bravo girl 💜"
"Oh my fuckin' hod, Natalie, give yourself a break. Yes, it's okay to want to feel beautiful, but there is only pain and hopelessness in chasing this idealised goal of a featureless doll based on general anatomic definitions of femininity. Ať some point you have to be able to say 'Bitch, I love myself' Because while some products vám make your skin look more smooth And youthful, what really makes a woman sexy Is their attitude. This 'big feminine dick energy' that conventionally beutiful Gigi shares with 60-years-old Madonna and conventionally non-beatiful Amanda Fuckin' Palmer.  Madonna was probably golf times and times again that she Will never be sexy until she fixes the tooth-gap. She didn't say 'I know I have a flaw bit the true beauty lies inside' she said 'Fuck you, my tooth-gap Is sexy'. A couple years later teenage girls around the world wished they had a tooth-gap just like her..."
"How i missed you nat 😩 i’m late for work now"
"No joke, vis a vis men liking makeup: I'm a chef so I'm not allowed to wear any makeup day to day, but I did attend a national awards event with my  coworkers and noticed that the one guy who went has been markedly nicer to me since seeing me in cute makeup and heels. Not that he was like awful to me before, he's just actively friendly now"
"Do you still have a cock or nah"
"I never look good. Not even once a month. Damn genes."

"Does Natalie really think she’s a six because that is blatant fucking lie? She’s genuinely really attractive."
"As Dr. Phil said on ... someone's podcast ' You compare your inner truth to other people's masks. That's why you feel inadequate.' At the end of the day we all see our flaws better than anyone else and feel hideous before going to bed.   Where was I going with this? Oh yeah. You're fine. Don't sweat it."
"I know how hard it is to feel pretty, I want you to know you are gorgeous!    (but if you want critique I'd use a darker lipstick with that blue and pink eyeshadow to better balance the face, I do love that lipstick on you but it just isn't meshing for me...if you don't want critique though, what the fuck do I know and wear whatever the fuck you want!)"
"Facial feminisation 😂. If you need that you are probably not a woman"
"Any other lesbians just straight chilling?"

"I was triggered when you left out the sunscreen, hun don't do that to me!!!"
"You look beautiful! I wish you saw yourself as pretty more often."
"It's like watching a movie"
"im a cis woman but i have a pretty square and masculine face so i can kind of relate to that, since ive also been thinking about getting plastic surgery, but honestly surgeries scare me and ive been trying to feel that inner beauty natalie's been talking about and it does help. same thing with weight, lots of people think just because they lose weight they will automatically feel better about themselves (I did too) but i can honestly say when i started to feel good about my body i also started losing weight because i was treating it better, one cannot exist without the other, also when i changed the way i look at my body it has become easier to keep the extra weight off, too.   and YES we lesbians are just chilling can confirm"

Slow down baby. We got time. Your parents won’t be home for awhile and I doubt the police even know I’m gone so let’s just relax a little and slow down cause I can’t understand a gawd damn thing you talkin about.

"fat thor help me feel better about myself."
"You know, the solution to being beautiful is to date someone beautiful. So,w ith that in mind, move to Denmark and date me. It is only logical ...   Joking aside, this video is probably not too targeted at me for the points you make, but your story and feelings are still fascinating to me."
"'They're biological sequins'  is merchworthy"
"Hhhhhhhhhhh my cis-lady, thick, chadly brow ridge 😢"
"Curiously, I sometimes feel as if my own perception of beauty is more 'adptable' than that of the average person. I've sort of always felt weird about the idea of makeup and the likes, even though I can't quite pinpoint why. I guess it seems to me like painting a fake face on top of your real face, and then casually acting as if that's your face, on some level it's weird to me, although I also have lot of contradictory sympathetic feelings about it, which I don't know quite how to resolve. Anyway, I feel as if this mentality has lead me to developing a more realistic perception of beauty, like I *want* to like women for how they really look, and have this *relatively* consistent habit of critically consider why I do or do not like how someone looks.   I want to like women for how they really look, learn to if need be. But that also makes me feel a bit annoyed about the fact that most women and most people on TV do wear makeup, since it kind of confuses my aspiration of always trying to learn how to appreciate realistic human features.    I've also always thought it's unfair that people get treated differently for how they look even when it's not really something they can control. There is something that kind of horrifies me about having the though 'that person is ugly', or at least to think about it in that way, seems so demeaning. There is something cruel about it, and it's kind of spurned me to try develop this ability of aesthetic good will, almost as if I'm trying to re-set my expecations and look at each face as if it was the first one I ever saw, and try to find something to like about it.   But I guess that's also the way I am about a lot of things, be it movies, art, fashion or music. Even when I don't think it's great, I can have this sort of vague unwillingness to really condemn something as bad, I often have that little voice in my head saying 'maybe it's not quite for me', 'I can appreciate the effort that went into this', 'that thing works, kind of?' and 'there's probably something here that's kind of neat'. I sometimes get the sense that other people are more cynical and presumpteous than they need to be when judging things. I can't tell if I'm sometimes more aesthetically open-minded than most people on some level, or if I just lack standards to begin with.   There's a also a bit of a problem with this will I have to want to see everyone as beautiful. Because even if I managed to literally see every face as beautiful, am I not at that point sort of de-valuing the concept of beauty? What would it mean to compliment someone if I could literally give that compliment to any other human? So I feel sort of strangely caught between three options: 1. I could try not to think too much about it and beauty and ugliness to people as it comes, and be able to value beaty according to how rare it is. 2. I could try to see everyone as beautiful, with all the weird contradictions that comes with that. Is beauty a positive if it applies to everyone? If I do go through so much to think of everyone as beautiful, isn't that kind of implying I think beauty is very important? And what happens when I inevitably fail, what if there's some extreme burn victim that I am simply unable to find beautiful, if I extend the label of beautiful to 99% of people, it would almsot seem even more cruel to those in the remaining 1%. 3. I could try to ditch the idea that natural beauty is important, and try to go full makeup-positive. We don't chose how we look by birth, so we could instead try to embrace the idea of defining ourselves by how we chose to look. But would such a culture encourage mroe and more makeup and surgery to attain increasingly fantasytical standards of post-human beauty? Would that kind of society have always ahve room for people who don't wanna use makeup?   I don't really know. This came out really rambly. I'm not sure I made a point, maybe I'm  just virtue-signaling or something. I honestly feel strangely dim-headed right now, I'm just gonna leave this here and hope someone at least reads this mess."

"i barely ever glance at the mirror and over the last 14 years a total of 4 pictures of me were taken. so my advice is: try to stop thinking about it my mom always says 'don't look into the mirror, because mirrors lie and if you want to find flaws, you will find flaws... always!'"

Not that I don't love them, it's just that I can't watch them casually. I think you could do both honestly..."
"I'm just starting the video but I already love it, you are amazing <3 (phil grad here😶)"
"I think it's best to take compliments at face value you can never know if the person making them is genuine or not but in the end it doesn't matter if it makes you feel good about yourself then it is worth absorbing who really cares or knows what other people think I wouldn't want to be in someone else's head anyways I have trouble enough existing in my own , I totally get the mirror thing too it's hard to look at yourself in the mirror without hating yourself or being too self critical, anyhow I ramble loved the video thanks comrade!"
"I can’t help but admit that lesbians are, indeed, chilling. I feel like we may have embraced the lesson of  this Video already. Style isn’t quite important, may it be a butch, femme, or other style. Actually, interestingly enough, going into the lesbian life, I had to face the fact that the beauty standards I had so deeply internalized were just not - applicable. It was quite a shock at first, and my style has in turn changed. But equally my care about “beauty” has Beene eased... a little. I think. Just tell me I’m beautiful."
"Is it wrong to say that her playing with her sequins gave me a boner! *LOLs*"

"SOPHIE x Contrapoints is the trans-community collab we all wanted but didn't think we'd have."
"I’ll admit to being a little sad that you changed your jaw. I have a rather prominent jaw and how amazing you looked in are traps gay and gender critical finally persuaded me to ditch my occasional insecurities about it. But this change doesn’t negate how you made me feel more confident. And more importantly, you deserve to feel happy with your body. It was a feature of your beauty I’ll miss (but for rather selfish reasons)   Also what’s this “I have no style” crap? Girl your style is so goddamn fun!"
"upvoted for bulgarian rose water"
"Co me on cinematography"
"I would have been terrified of the risks of surgery if I had known in advance. Thanks for not telling us. 😉 And you always passed in my view... As for make-up, you really do look seriously cute without it."
"I'm a woman in academia, and I wear very little makeup (just to cover the black rings around my eyes since I don't sleep much) and I don't dress sexy, but I do get more than enough male attention ;-) even when I'm already married; though lately I've wondered if as I get older (I'm 30) I'll need to use more makeup to look at least as good as I do now haha Anyway, I can't talk for other women, so I'll speak for myself: I don't wear much makeup nor dress super sexy/feminine because I just don't care enough, I see it as a lot of effort, and I honestly never learned to use makeup. It takes time to learn to do your makeup as good as you, and I just never thought it mattered. I guess somewhere in the bottom of my heart I always expected to be loved and noticed as I look or maybe despite how I look . Don't think that every woman who is in academia and doesn't wear makeup is trying to be respected in the field, somehow I find it really depressing that you think that. If it were like that those women would've used makeup before getting in the field, and that's not my experience. My experience is that most people who use makeup as teens continue using it as adults, and those who don't use it as adults usually didn't use it as teens. At least, that's my observation based on the people I know, inside and outside the field. I never used makeup and it wasn't like I knew that I wanted to be in academia when I was a teen. Neither did my best friend (still doesn't) and she's a housewife. Let's just acknowledge that not all people care about the same things and have the same inclinations, needs, etc. It'd be like saying that skinny guys without big muscles don't want to be masculine, uh, THEY DO!, they just don't care enough about those who judge them as such, or they're lazy, or they think they're masculine in their own way, etc. I want to be beautiful like every other woman, I just like to think that I am beautiful without much effort, and my man still loves me like I am, so I'm lucky, I guess."

I had long tried accept/love my flaws according to the received wisdom, but now at age 30 it feels like I am finally acknowledging a long-held repressed desire to be beautiful which I had always been told was vain or felt to be false.You only get one body and one chance to 'looksmax' it, why not do that and enjoy feeling pretty for once before you get old?"

"I love it, still watching, but where is her top from!!!"
"I hope you were joking about sunscreen o_O lol"
"I will say that women doing makeup even in prison by sucking dick is a strong evidence that women's desire to wear makeup is related to 'because evolution', otherwise you'd just be able to wait it out and not really give a damn. Personally, I think makeup is an partially subconscious and partially conscious thing - the exact beauty standards seems to be coming from our culture, but, the desire to be beautiful seems to come from the depths below, which is the interface between the conscious and the subconscious in regards to makeup.   In a lot of ways, it's potentially also a part of the female social game, which is why women wear makeup for other women to a degree where they seem more concerned about other women's thoughts than men's thoughts. If they really cared about attracting men more so than women, women would be showing all the skin and walk around almost naked half the time, as well as wear various kinda lingerie just for the hell of attracting men. We men aren't that complicated. I'm not complicated, at least. Heh.   ... Or those are my pet theories. I'm more than likely wrong."
"Well done Natalie. The production of that intro was Next Level💗"
"When I first watched your videos I legit had no idea you were trans I thought you passed real hecking well. But like now it's ×100"
"The ending made me worry that you were heading toward dark places... Take care of yourself!   I admire the cases you make in your videos (having watched all of them) - they make me think (in a good way), while I mostly spend my free time trying to avoid thinking (the negative way).  Regarding beauty:   I guess I have some deep-seated internalized misogyny and self-loathing influencing my judgement here, but I always immediately dislike women in heavy makeup and/or who are conventionally beautiful. I'd like to say that's because I disapprove of them using so much time and money to look like someone else (instead of more 'worthwhile' pursuits like, er, youtube *oops*) or that they cannot be smart and good people if they are pretty, because that would just be unfair ;). But it's more likely that I just think that I am not, and can never be, beautiful or skillfully made-up, so I have to devalue them misogynisticly as shallow and stupid or untrustworthy, in order to assert myself. Which might be what many other 'Becky'-women do as well. The underlying problem is (at least in my case) low self-esteem, and no amount of makeup or surgery can fix that. In the past, if someone told me I was beautiful, that they liked my body, I just did not believe them. But with time, that is beginning to change. I am beginning to relate to my body in a new way, and sometimes, I look at my image in the mirror and I actually like what I see.  So, I hope you too find a way to make peace with your body, and if surgery helps, than it's good for you. I think you have a fascinating mind and a charming personality, and I actually found you attractive in your first videos  (probably because I like gender-ambiguous presentation like you did back then). I find beauty in your stylistic choices and the art of your videos, even if I find your makeup sometimes overwhelming. (There was one video a while back when you played a lesbian, with a ponytail, little makeup and a checkered shirt? Then I really found you beautiful, with yearning instead of disapproval.  I thought 'I wish I looked like that').   Final remark:  I'm a fan. And I won't shower you with exaggerated compliments you wouldn't believe anyway (not like there's much of a chance you'll ever see this). But I admire the work you do on this channel, I think you deserve respect and admiration, and yes, you are  beautiful... whether I like your style or not. And whether you can see it in yourself or not. <3"
"Personally, I see the same beautiful woman as before. (Please don't take that the wrong way. You do you boo.)"
"Hey! You know what?!  You're beautiful, Natalie."
"Paused at 20:53 : look, I got your point about make-up. You & pesumably other women just like putting it on xD alright. but seeing you right before you start, I have to say: you have probably never looked more like a woman that was born a girl to me than  before you go through the whole procedure. Not only does it look more feminine to me, it even looks prettier.  Not sure if that sabotages your chart earlier, but...  Anyway, let's see the rest of the video, I guess ^^'  Edit: some rewind just showed that this about skin care. Well alright, nonetheless I stand by my earlier statement ;-)  Edit2: those were some nice thoughts about style in the end. Gj nice video"
"Hugs."
"Choosing style over beauty? Until that moment I didn't know it was possible to experience a full-body orgasm from validation alone."
"Wow! I thought you were pretty before, but holy shit."
"Phones live in a society"
"Oh God, I wasn't ready for this.  Too real, too heavy, to close to home.  I gotta pause"
"SURGERY COMMENT: Oh, that's why you look so different now. I've been so confused at first, though tranfobia started. I will still need some time to readjust tho. Feeling a bit of unanny valley, as if some random bae tries to pass as Contra. Aaand i got used to it. VIDEO COMMENT: When i was a lil baby everyone told me that accepting myself is the first thing you must learn to become adult, duh. Why would i even bother with looks when there is so much habbits and diets and other shit to manage to keep mind clear and focused. Emotions are product of thoughts anyway, so correct thinking habits = feeling beautiful. ADVICE: Also you are making A GIANT MISTAKE, at least it looks like it. You are getting too close to the mirror/camera, which not only shows the flaws, but also distorts proportions. Everyone looks bad at a kiss distance.   Moral of the story: Good thing i have no instagramm. Also, is it weird that i'm into slightly fat short legless asians? I'm not sure beauty standards even exist anywhere besides our social personas. I bet literally everybody has some weird totally unique kink that absolutely doesn't aligns with what's considered beautiful.  Cause i can't name a single person that trusts me enough to disclose one that doesn't have a kink."
"Dang.. relatable... thanks for bringing up that point about style. I’m terrified of being ugly and growing old."
"Minecraft"
"Love this for us"
"About the double eyelid surgery, not every asian person thinks that it's motivated by a (wrong) sense of inferiority, sometimes is done for pure beauty purpose, with or without influence from the west: it makes eyes appear bigger and more expressive . It's not always about Orient vs Occident"
"1:20 I think my brain started leaking out my nose"
"honestly one of the reasons I figured out I was trans is because I realized that the only reason I thought I was ugly is because I was looking up to male beauty standards with a feminine body. and yeah I have internalized some feminine beauty standards, but that's mostly because I know I won't pass until I take T so I might as well look as attractive as I can even if it lowers my chances of passing until then"
"You look gorgeous (and definitely not diseased without makeup)! :)"
"I wish I could afford a female skull."
"That Sophie intro 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
"watching you hangover naked in the bathroom after having just returned from long night just made my day, and its 8 a.m so it gives a lot, thancc mommy <3"
"I am most certainly NOT grateful that you are wearing clothes. (Also nice video.)"
"Your changes look good, but I’m a straightish guy who was crushing on you pretty hard even before the surgery. I’m honest, just ask and I’ll prove it with honest critiques and more praise."
"fear and loathing reference fucks yeahs"
"To be honest you didn't look bad before either. People are just hating on you.  Or maybe I have some pretty interesting views and tastes, but that's a subject best left untouched."
"Ben Shapiro ad before the video :|"
"Omg you're so beautiful! Completely unclockable, boo."
"That ending expressed something I've been unconsciously doing lately. I'm cis but I've been fat my whole life, and I always felt ugly and was told I wasn't pretty, so I recently started cultivating clothes that I thought were cute and doing my makeup that I always thought I was too good for. Lo and behold, I feel better about myself, and when I'm in public and I know I look good I'm not so crushed under the weight of strangers eyes on me because I'm confident they think I'm pretty too. It's not a fix for a lot of deep issues, but it's been integral to my self esteem and I'm much happier thinking I look good"
"To be very honest, Natalie, you still look cute without make-up."
"OMG that before and after O___O I wouldn't really have noticed if you didn't show that"

"YESS SOPHIE!"
"Wonderful, as always. Those sequins made me tingle everywhere! The days without you are years."
"Can you stop normalising incest. “Daddy Dom”. It’s triggering to victims of child abuse. Your vids are amazing and emotionally honest and I’m a big fan but that is very off putting."
"I used to work with skincare (employed 10 years tyvm) and therefore i aM one out of three people in the World who know what a toner does: it balances the pH level in your skin after using soaps and cleansers. Your skin Can do This by itself, but it Will often create a lot of Oil in order to do This, since Oil protects the surface of the skin. This is also the difference between 90’s ‘tonics’ and modern toners: toners dont contain any type of alcohol which Will dry out the surface area of the skin"
"FFS and all the other surgeries feel like a glass ceiling for impoverished trans people. For some of us, makeup and forced self acceptance are the only options.  As a result it can be pretty upsetting and anxiety-inducing when someone looks beautiful to us, but states they aren't happy with themselves. If looking 'super fish' isn't enough, then what hope is there for we burgeoning few?"

"Brutal feedback from a contra stan: You’d look better with a sleek haircut right to the tops of your shoulders. Kiss those dead ends goodbye! I know “long hair feels feminine.” But I think it would surprise you how it could change your look. Just imo tho, you’re still gorgeous as always 💕"
"I was getting a real Adult Swim vibe with that intro."
"would you be willing to say how much your full ffs cost u? for me bottom surgery is top priority but after that i really want ffs too if i ever have enough money.. so just want an idea of how much i will need to save.."
"2:00 WHERE IS LORD FOPPINGTON?!"
"I just had to assume people thought I was beautiful and so it was.  Reality is constructed in your mind alone.  You create the beauty in your mind - the world could think you are beautiful but if you do not believe it... well it just won't be your own reality.  Being beautiful is a reality we just assume in to being, no one else can give it to us outside ourselves."

"Natalie you look great and I’d do psychedelics with you"
"Argh, I feel you on the 'ravages of time' thing. I don't think I'm 'aging well', so to speak (I'm a little younger than you) but c'mon, face, I haven't even got started yet! :/ Give me more time..."

"All hail the Night Mother, returning to grant us knowledge and further our collective wokeness."
"I don't think I would've noticed you actually surgery. I thought you were joking until you showed the before and after"
"This video makes me uncomfortable, and I would be honest if I were to say that I'm uncomfortable because of the vanity, but I would also be honest if I were to say that I'm uncomfortable because Natalie has parted her hair differently and because the color scheme is unfamiliar.  What I mean to say is, as much as I feel and understand deeply that vain pursuits do not bring lasting joy, we do experience an aesthetic reality, and no one is truly free from judgments based on experiences of the senses. To judge another for vanity is, itself, vanity.    All I would really like to say, however, is that eternal satisfaction comes from eternal sources. What lasts forever? There is an answer, but you won't hear me when I say it. Blissful to age and to die, my body slows to a stop and melts. There is ecstasy in the infinite. I know only the unknowable and knowable nothing, wind in branches, candle wax words, moonless night (moonless night)"

"Hi Natalie, I watch your videos with my mother who I live with because I am a: success. We got involved because we loved your videos on fascism. We loved your recent video on the climate crisis. What I'm saying is I do nahhhht give a shiny shite about how you look, I don't stan you because of your flawless highlight or your shapely brow. So I say this as an academic who isn't on Youtube to stare at great looking people: hot daaaaayyyymmmm girl, you look FANTASTIC! You've always looked beaut to me but I'm telling you right now because I totally understand the want for people's validation of looks (and say that cis AF). This is me being 100% honest, I hope the surgery has made you happy in the long run and you really do look stunning.   And this video is, as always, brilliant."

"20:10 You know, I know you address this very thing in your video, but I actually think you look good there. I understand the concerns over appearance, everyone is their own worst critic. And I also understand what you mean about some people being liars and flatterers, especially your fans, and how you can't ever really tell if they are just telling you what you want to hear or not. But I mean this. I looked at you there for a minute or so and really tried to think what my perspective of that face would be if I didn't know who you were and just saw you on the street. I think honestly, I'd see you as a distinct looking, but otherwise cute girl. Perhaps one who looks somewhat tired of whatever she was doing at the moment, but still cute."

"Ah come on pretty pretty! I had three stages of FFS (Brigitte Meijer, VUMC) last year. I was not impressed. I had my breasts (Laura Zaal, Velthuys) done literally last week thursday,  again, I was more or less elated.  The only thing I found impressive about my GRS (Kanhai, MCA) was the fact I stank like roadkill sweltering a few days in some backyard hospital.  Any pain and discomfort was glorious! A liberation.    Yeah beautiful is the thing we are after. We have to compensate for years of not feeling this. I also had a facial paralysis so it was a double whammy of wanting to be my female self, as well as having a face that was actively menacing to nearly everyone.    Yeah you are in the 2% top in pretty now.  But what I would wish is that I was as pretty on the inside as you. I am dark and damaged inside, and not from over use of plugs. There is a residual hatred and despair in my soul that may take centuries (Aubrey de Grey) to wash away. 2 May this year I lost the person I would marry. A self-identified sissy with a small dick no less. Then she fucking chose prostitution and money and creature comforts over me. I was close to suicide.  I lost 10 kilo bodyweight since the breakup. I can't eat any more.   So that's how much I gained from 5 major surgeries. a year of nearly deadly HRT despair - six month with a pretty sissy (who faked totally being in love with me for at leats half of that), and she walked out on me in favor of a butt-ugly trans prostitute with more money to hook old men for money. We can't win baby. We are circling the black hole. One day I may give myself the push and just fuck off from this planet.  Maybe very soon.  So when you getting tits and pus? Get an O-wand, they are spectacular.  Use one on 2CB, I get orgasms lasting 2 minutes."

Some humans have art in their blood and anything can be a canvas, ANYTHING, foam in the coffee? yup, stone, wood, glass? yup, your own face? double yup, the very body your soul resides in? yup yup yup. I want to tell you that I think you're beautiful but you won't believe me, as I won't believe my drawings are ever pretty enough."

I find all the countless hours of staring in the mirror looking at the shape of my chin, eyes, nose, etc etc is fueled by a desire to be perceived how *I* want to be as feminine, respectable, clean, and worthy of some type of positive attention. Maybe body shape is inherently part of our perception of that, but makeup is easily changeable and convenient. & I mean, people listen to you and compliment you when your skin is glowing and your eyebrows are perfectly filled... even if everyone knows its just a bunch of powder layered on top of skin. It's I think, at least for me, an adornment of some kind... my 2 cents : )   Plus, many women just put on makeup to watch TV sometimes. What men are they trying to impress? The Starks? Hell, I'm planning on putting on makeup to hang out at my parents house tomorrow."
"Congrats on reaching 600,000 subscribers."
"Ouch! I resonated with this so much! I want to be beautiful, too. I want people to stop calling me 'sir'. At 55, I'm worried it's too late for me. But, I am finding beauty in new ways."
"I like everything that has no style: dictionaries, photographs, nature, myself and my paintings (because style is violence and I am not violent). Gerhard Richter"
"But, did you get a Stacy skull or a Becky skull?"
"As with the body hair you mentioned, many women have voices below contralto. Why not abandon the Mickey Mouse voice training and settle into a more comfortable register? Many men find a deeper voice attractive. TAGS, 'husky', 'deep-throated', 'smoky', 'mellow'."
"Hell of a monologue, this."
"I love some unintentional ASMR sparkly fish"
"I don't want to be negative, but her approach to videos changed a lot. I loved the format where she discussed points with herself (you know - contrapoints), and these last few videos are just her in full views telling her opinion. I just liked the discussion version better since this way looks just like she is exploring just one side of the story."
"Everyone is beautiful in their unique way! Nope. I want my ugliness to be validated first before we do anything about it."
"Hi, Natalie. I really think that you are so beautiful. Speaking as a heteroflexible man, I am very attracted to you, and not just because I respect you. I mean, that is part of attraction, but I feel joy just by the sight of you.  I wish you the best with your self-esteem. I know it's hard. Perhaps harder for you, in some ways, but I mean to say that you aren't alone in being very critical of your own appearance. I desperately want you to love the way you look.  Your insights have given me hope for the future of our society in America, and inspired me to realize that I need to involve myself in politics, and stop enabling hateful behavior. I love you!"
"I'd really like talking to you about my experience with the way I look and beauty and the way that I feel that makeup and society and social media have effected me as a cis-gender female."
"AHHH!!! DISEASE!!! 20:05 ...  Great, thanks a lot. Now that 'diseased' joke will constantly pop in my head when I see girls without makeup. And it's all your fault."
"As always, thank you a million times for this video...but especially so today, because it is my birthday, and I really needed what you did here to make my day complete.  So, thank you!  I am 43 today, and as long as the top of my head is covered, I still get mistaken for someone in my late 20s, as long as they don't look more closely, or hear me talk about things I remember (like 1979, when I was three, which I do remember!)...!?!  ;)  You also used one of my favorite songs in this video:  Saint-Saens' 'The Aquarium' from Carnival of the Animals...which I refer to in my own mind as 'the fishtank song' because for all of my advanced degrees, I'm still rather simple at heart.  I hope what I'm about to say provides you some good dopamine hits, because it is also entirely true and sincerely expressed.  I have loved everything about your inner beauty from the time I started watching you:  you are intelligent, have an attractive personality, are absolutely hilarious and I love your sense of humor, and you are someone whose honesty in your own inner processes is so genuinely and reflectively articulated that it makes me feel better about my own processes and self-questioning.  I have also thought from the start that you are a beautiful human being physically, and not only one that is beautiful, but one that is personally attractive to me (which doesn't always happen...some people I find attractive are not beautiful, and some people I recognize as beautiful are not attractive to me!).  That is not to undermine you, though, or to devalue your own feelings about your appearance, or to say that you didn't 'need' FFS, or that I liked you better before or anything like that; it also isn't to remotely suggest that your appearance now is in any way deficient, or either greater or lesser than it was before the procedure.  What I can clearly see, though, is that you feel more 'yourself' now than you did before, and if that possibility of feeling that way makes you more yourself, then that does make you more beautiful, and more effectively beautiful, and thus I am in total agreement that such has been the result, and I am very happy that you are more happy, even if surgery didn't solve all of the problems or make you suddenly more confident in your level of beauty.  That you have shared all of this so honestly actually makes you even that much more beautiful, in my view, because the truth of your inner struggles and the reality of them then shines through that much more in your newfound outer beauty transformations.  I'm sure you're familiar with the Ancient Greek concept of kalokagathia, which is both pernicious and false, and yet also so utterly true to how many of us experience the world whether we would intellectually prefer to or not.  More could be said about that, certainly...  And, just to be clear about these things:  whatever one might assume about my name, I'm a gender-diverse person (that's a long story!), encompassed imperfectly but fairly accurately by the non-binary label, and I find you attractive and beautiful in a variety of ways.  Very few people find me beautiful physically, though the few who have come to appreciate me in my fullest gender identity have tended to do so (and that's not even a handful of people that I've met personally at this point!); some straight women and gay men have found me attractive but have not accepted my gender identity, and thus I have no time for them at all because they then try to impose inappropriate standards, behavior requirements, and mindset expectations (amongst other things!) on me which I both cannot and will not fulfill for them.  In the interests of brevity, and trying to sustain your dopamine hits from before (if the above was useful in that regard!), I will keep this confessional to the present length for now.  But again, thank you for your ongoing work, and your inspirational influence, and especially so on this not-awful-but-not-fantastic-either natal day of mine today!  I eagerly await what you will present for us the next time!"
"Once again, putting my thoughts into your own words. Style seems worthwhile for lots of reasons, without that many downsides, with the right attitude anyway"
"Please start an ASMR channel.  Your  message will spread like wildfire!"
"i’m watching this while doing my makeup"
"You look like a cross between Anna Ferris and Celine Dion, now."
"The Post-Op Blues are very very real as well. I mean, obviously you've always felt this way in the past - but you mentioned how you've been feeling quite down this past month and I thought I'd mention Post-Op depression as another reason as to why you've been feeling especially down after your surgeries. xxx"
"Oh SOPHIE"
"💞💖💓❣💘 this video is perfect 💕💛💝💗💞💓"
"Interesting video as always. I thought you looked amazing before, but you look even better now.   As for me, I've not had and don't plan on having FFS. I have had SRS which has gotten rid of the majority of my dysphoria. But as for my face, I'm pretty happy with the changes from HRT. I usually don't even bother with make up unless I'm going to work or performing. To work because it feels more professional and on stage because I want to look as good as possible. In day to day life, I figure that I look 'okay'. Based on what I used to look like as a man, I think it's pretty amazing that I've been able to turn myself into something resembling a woman. I've got pretty good genetics to thank for a lot of it. My mother is 70 but looks closer to 50 so hopefully I will age in a similar fashion. Of course, I still worry about the effects of aging. I have very fair skin so I burn very easily anyway, but I read somewhere that Kate Beckinsale wears sunscreen every day as part of her skin care regime. She's 10 years older than me but looks 10 years younger than me, so I've added that into my own daily skin regime. I guess though, because I'm asexual, I don't have that desire to attract anyone, so I just try and make myself happy with how I look. Sometimes that probably looks a bit quirky to others, but it's what feels right for me."
"great video, well presented, very helpful for my friend who is similarly in the position of trying to be beautiful and be a trans woman."
"ah, new contrapoint video. my depression will be alleviated for the next 30 min 51 sec"
"I can't prove that I am being honest and not just gushing as a fan. Nonetheless, even after the pre/post comparison I can barely tell there's any difference at all, yet the subconscious effect is precisely as intended. You look amazing, congratulations on a successful operation!"
"It's a double edged sword.   I think that the more you obsess over beauty standards, the better your taste becomes, and the more refined your self (or other) criticisms become. You COULD spend that time and energy into 'altruistic' ventures, but you'd sacrifice your carefully honed aesthetic tastes. I never put in the effort into such things, and developed tastes in others, but I lament never having done so. I wish I had great taste in fashion, decor, and self care. I wish I could look great and express myself in the ways you maybe take for granted. For every pore you think is too large, is a plain black hanes tshirt with holes I've worn to work 3 days in a row, because I can't be bothered to find anything better. You've put in the effort to care, and it shows, and you should be proud of it"
"Yes, you are pretty."

"fine you changed brow bones. great you changed nose... but I loved your chin - many woman would do reverse of what you did an kill for such chin bones that does not need conturing and will got result in doublechin in old age. Well I would."
"Commenting for engagement"
"I'm don't like plastic surgery, but... you're beautifull! (anyway, you're beautifull before too, but if you feel good is the only thing that is important!)"
"Well... I often wear makeup bcs i think not only i am not pretty anough but also my face is so boring, it is usual, not beautiful not ugly, not standing out, just like all So I am in chase to feel special, like i want pleasant attention from others and be in that beauty class of people which I never belong Probably thats because  of how fancy all girls in films, like they are lead in its fantasy and I want it too"
"Ok I am a cis man, but i guess I know what this feeling is like(SORT OF) , I mean I was  a fat boy the most part of my life, and I never felt happy about my looks, and some day I simply said to myself, I don't want to be fat anymore so I losed  I guess 88 pounds, but  somedays even when i was already slimmer, I didn't felt much better you know, I felt some kind of emptyness, but with some help of my friends and family  I finally discover the happiness  within me, and finally started to felt self-appreciation, and this feeling is priceless or I could better say its price is sometimes a lot tears, a lot of prays and a lot of lonely walks (and I sorry if I had committed some grammar error) also this video is amazing."
"changing my username to sistercel"
"Alternatively, I, as a cis woman headed towards academia, rarely wear makeup because I'm lazy as heck"

"You'd look great with a goatee, dude."
"choke me mommy"
"Ok, given that this video is pretty new, maybe someone will read this and I'll get some sort of explanation. What exactly is up with Nat's use of 'biological'? Like, I get that she uses the terms sort-of ironically most of the time, but it's still a little confusing to me, since the 'biologically female' descriptor is something I usually use as a polite way of describing cis-female attributes, whilst trying do sound invalidating to trans women and whatnot.  I remember she talked about her 'biological titties' once, and that seems to have made sense *enough* in the context, since her breasts are grown from estrogen. I guess her now saying her brain is biologically female is a way of saying she probably is fundamentally wired to have a female gender identity?  But often I'm not quite sure exactly what rational is behind her use of the term, and I'm not even entirely sure to what extent it's a joke or not, and it sort of get me worried that fence-sitters who see the video will dismiss her as being delusional or deceptively new-speaking or something, since 'biological' this and that seems to usually be used for talking about natually developed cisgender attributes.  Can anyone clue me in if there is something I'm not getting about this? I'd google it instead of asking comment questions, but I don't think I can specifially google Nat's rational behind the usage of a word."
"Many thanks for sharing this amazing video."
"you look so fucking cute i luv u"
"Wuff contra if youre a 6 im a 2 haha"
"i'm only like three minutes into the video so excuse me if this is inappropriate or ironic considering the topic but god damn natalie you are so fucking pretty"
"The five seconds she gets distracted by her own shirt is what I live for."
"Why aren't you my shrink or my shrink more like you?"
"Do whatever makes you feel beautiful, if it makes you feel better about yourself, than that is great. No matter what, I've started watching you just a couple months ago and didn't realize you were transgender until 6 consecutive episodes in and you literally said it (The whole time I figured you were a cis woman). You have changed my entire concept of trans individuals and I thank you for it. Either way you look great now and I love your channel and hope nothing but the best to you."
"stop blabbing so-self obsessively. You're acting like a girl. Oh wait. nvm"
"Oh wow, is Lizzie Kommes back in prison? Dang Love After Lockup spoiler."
"The incels using terms like 'looksmaxing' and 'skinmaxing' reminds me too much of gamer-speak, which might be the entire point.   They want to min-max their character sheets in Charisma and Strength so that they can cheese the 'pussy-crushing' game and become level 20 chads without grinding for character development and real-life XP."
"You look very feminine! I’m happy for you :)"
"Contrapoints makes me feel like an idiot, she's so woke."
"Great video! I always look forward to them and this one was just as amazing as always. P.S. you look great Nat, and you deserve to believe that as much as we believe it"
"Tbh, I have an obsession with beauty as well. I personally don't like the concept of having a belly due to many years of my you get brother bullying the shit out of me about it, and some tensions with my family. It caused me to lose confidence in my appearance and I would basically look at myself in the mirror in disgust. I am currently working on losing weight but tbh I still don't like associating my own fat as being 'good looking'. Like I have a body shape similar to Ethan Klein and it really just bugs me. If you think only women deal with some form of beauty or personal self loathing regarding ones appearance it's not as black white as you think. Men like me deal with it too, it's why dudes go to the gym and hit the treadmill in the first place. So anyways I just wanted to share my personal experiences I guess...nothing more than that really"
"Let the Darkness flow over you. Accept the apocalypse. Embrace it. Encourage it. Accelerate it. Death is the one true freedom."
"So you’re not gonna tell us where you got the dress though?"
"Natalie, as someone who is asexual  and also loves makeup I really appreciate you articulating how beauty relates to so much more than the facade of trying to be sexually attractive. Also, not an exaggeration, but you are truly beautiful."
"Natalie... I'm fairly certain a fair amount of people would be more than okay if you were not wearing clothing. In fact, I'd find it really strange if your DMs were not filled with messages from people suggesting you stop wearing clothing around them.   I suppose the style is a way around things... I tend to go more a Steam Punk or Goth route. With me somehow managing to not have the Gate Keeping Elitist Goths kicking me out (or coming up with ways that I am not Goth enough)... somehow. Which is a weird bit of victory. One of those successes that feels like failure somehow. I mean--my darkest secret is that I do not even smoke clove cigarettes... and I'd figure that it is obvious... and yet... it is not brought up.   Yes... I got around being quite remarkably hideous of an eldritch horror by doing the goth thing... my shambling masses and tendrils that move outside of how euclidean geometry can define just require a small amount of liquid eye liner... and suddenly all the boys are in my yard... they are all mindless flesh drones with the personality of mushed peas... but I have summoned an army of boys in my yard--and this is prior to my concocting a milkshake OF DOOM! MWAH HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"

"When you have large breasts from 13 onwards there is a lot of discomfort both from the physicality of having them and the interactions from other people. So i made the choice to have a reduction so i could no longer have back pain. BUT so i could also feel comfortable in my own body. So I can understand why you would go through the pain and anxiety to make a choice such as plastic surgery. I am happier because of it."
"So you could talk shit to Blaire White for having surgery but now you expect it to be a 'journey' for you? Your politics are as fickle as a woman, I'll give you that."

I just realized I'm still obsessed and if I ever make it out of poverty I'll aim after a fictitious human(oid? ish? the nerds who read the 90's manga can correct me) futuristic android from a post apocalyptical future the house - but flat chested 'cause I'm one of the non-binary freaks who dare to be 🙃"

"Aw man I couldn't listen to all the details of the surgery without writhing and wincing. Don't think I could have done it. You look great Natalie, glad to have you back so soon!"
"Mommy contra is back!"
"whatever tranny"
"I hate to say this cuz I want to be above shallowness, but yes, those few millimeters of bone made you seem so feminine in comparison. I can actually feel myself move from 'contrapoints is smart funny and stylish' to 'shit I can feel myself slightly more nervous as I instinctual ly consider contrapoints a potential mate now'  Tl;Dr your plastic surgeon is an artist"

"You creeped me out before my bedtime, now I will think of masked strangers with flashing green eyes strangling me in my bed while mumbling to themselves about my bone structure."
"Here's the thing, like the real thing why it's bad to worry about your looks: It's not the reason you feel like shit. You think it is, but your brain is lying to you. You have issues with self-worth and anxiety and whatever and all those things are projected on to your appearance.  Looking beautiful doesn't make you happy and when you're happy, you won't care about your appearance.  It's that simple. Anytime your brain tells you you're too fat, or too old or whatever, it also tells you that all your friends secretly hate you.  So you gotta fucking ignore it. And instead of listening to your brain's lies, you gotta find the things that really make you happy.  Like Anti-depressants."
"girl the SOPHIE feature!! icons all around im soaking in trans power"
"I’m non-binary and my relationship with beauty is...complicated. My internal gender identity sits pretty solidly in the middle of the spectrum, but my presentation will change from day to day. I love dark, baggy “boyish” clothes that blur the lines and make me look more androgynous-but I also love flowery, lacy, over the top fairy makeup complete with horned flower crowns and a rainbow butterfly cape. From years of being identified as female I’ve learned that I like a lot of feminine things, but some days I don’t have the energy to wear them, even if I want to. Especially on my period (god help me) I feel like my body is forcing me to be feminine in a way I have control over and even if I want to wear that adorable purple dress, there’s no way in hell I’m walking out of the house in anything but shapeless, black clothes and a backwards cap. I can compensate in other ways: using “male” scents in my body wash, deodorant and cologne, letting my body hair grow wild etc. but it only helps soften the internal nagging that I look like a girl and these tiddies just aren’t going anywhere anytime soon."
"wait is the outro song from the minecraft soundtrack?!? IWS CWONTWAPWOINTWS A FWEWWOW GWAMEWR?????????"
"God I love all your videos and I relate the hardest to this one. I struggle to talk to people in person because of how self-conscious I feel about my appearance and the expressions I make that I can't really control. It's been a paralyzing force for me my whole life and I have fantasized about plastic surgery a long time to see if it would help solve that problem. But you might be right to say that it wouldn't... because there's still ways my face *moves* that *feel* wrong. Like maybe I'll never be pleased with however much work I get done because I just don't like the *me* in this body. I don't even know what I would need to be happy."
"Don't fish, Natalie."
"You look great, dear. I’m happy for you."
"You are very intelligent and funny so kudos to that and I sincerely don't want to burst your bubble and hurt your feelings, but the truth is that what you are doing may be severely damaging to many humans who are confused and/or have damaged endocrine systems (due to poor diet, lack of exercise, etc) coupled with emotional trauma from dysfunctional relationships with male and female role models (due to poor parenting, mostly). You still look and sound like a dude. This of course doesn't meant you still can't find happiness, but it's not beneficial to humanity to celebrate or condone a mental illness as it can easily normalize it in others. What confused, damaged individuals need is love, hugs, kisses, and a good family and friends support system to aid them in getting back into living a healthy life as ascribed by their dna. And no, I'm not a 'transphone', I'm a realist who looks at the stats which show overt evidence towards the fact that the majority of people who transition are worse off for it in the long run. Wishing everyone peace, healing, and harmony. And yes, I know that my comment will most likely be completely fruitless as you have 600k subs so will not stop making youtube videos due to the good income it provides, but I still strongly suggest you take a good long look at science-backed biology and transition into becoming a positive force for the world, not an insidiously divisive one...   Also, bare with me but nihilistic bitter 'progressives' need to stop myopically and ignorantly calling everything they dislike or find silly a 'social construct'. All the 'bad' stuff in the world didn't just instantly explode out of the void. They naturally arise due to the advantages they provide in our naturally evolving hierarchies. For example if you were a woman who lived in a village of 50 men and 50 women and wanted to mate with the strongest male to produce the strongest children, you would look for any advantage you could find. If you ate some bright red berries which turned your lips redder or you just did some physical exercise which made your cheeks rosy-colored, you would naturally find that the men in your tribe started to find you more sexually attractive therefore you would do these aforementioned tricks more frequently. This is why makeup can be found in human cultures across the globe, even in small villages - it naturally arises due to the competitive edge it gives. Sincerely ask yourself: if an apocalypse occurred and you were the last human alive in your area, would you still take time to diligently put on makeup to 'feel prettier'? The answer is that the real world would come crashing down and your natural survival instincts would kick in real quick. There would be more pressing matters. So anyway my point is that the term 'social construct' is a tautological say-nothing phrase developed by intelligent post-modernist professors looking for ways to write papers which weren't previously written in order to garner praise from their nerd community and keep their jobs, so to take the time to harp on it as detrimental is antithetical to nature itself and thus will never be expunged from societies. The English language has enough words and tools with implicit power coming from distant perspectives imbued into them to enable this divisive 'new-think' posits, but that itself does not mean it should be done. Knowledge is great but it can go too far into anti-human territory, as displayed here (aka too much cognitive dissonance is bad for humans). Thank you for reading and do something to make yourself proud today, even if it's just a small action."
"Well, I have a slight disagreement. Make-up is not 90% about women expressing themselves. It's at least somewhat a flex on other women. Men tell each other how big their dick is, not because they want to fuck each other, but because they want other men to kNoW thEy FUck. Women want other women to know they can get it."

"Glad the ffs went well. Missed you. You still got it."
"What about the idea that make-up and beauty regimes are something more related with a ritual practice of acceptance and a way of taking ownership of one's image, as way of fighting the natural dissonance between that 'ideal self' and what your genetics, environment and perception distillate as your personal image?"
"1. loved the video! very fun to listen to while staring at your pretty outfit 2. thank you for the before and after shots, I knew something was different but didn't know what exactly was going on with your face, and it would've bugged me if i didn't know. 3. You look very pretty, natalie! I think so anyway. ^^ if it's any consolation, your lovely eyes and hair remind me of shaylene woodley so if you think she's pretty, then you're very pretty! if not, sorry. 4. and HOLY CRAP! THAT ENDING/MORAL ABOUT STYLE WAS INCREDIBLE! thank you for putting it into words, I have been wanting a way to express how I have self-confidence in my appearance despite not feeling like a 10   Anyway keep up the great work, good luck in the rest of your recovery!"

"I'm going to have to disagree about this being a patriarchal problem thats imposed women.   Men have just as much beauty standards. There are posters and ads of 6'2 buff guys everywhere.    In fact, I would argue that the beauty standards imposed on men are even more strict than the beauty standards women have."

"I am pretty sure that beauty is not an invention of some trans-dimensional reptilian overlords bent on preserving its leash on humanity. Beauty is innate. we know what beauty is just like we know that pizza tastes good: it is a natural desire put through a cultural lens. wanting to be beautiful is as organic and immutable as wanting to eat cake. You don't spend several thousand dollars on plastic surgery to fix your beauty obsession, though. that is an unbalance of desires that can not be satisfied. You get the surgery to stop the distraction so you can focus on fixing the imbalance. or, work out, or play with make up, or buy new shoes.   these things are pleasurable, and we need to keep them in perspective. being attractive is exciting and fun and necessary. it feels good to look nice. it feels good to hear compliments. and, these things can have powerful affects on your self-esteem. I don't think there is any shame in giving in to things that feel good. Just don't get it twisted: you are the same person, no matter how many millimeters of bone you add or subtract. being pretty is therapy. it makes the journey to self acceptance easier. but, it is still a journey that must be taken. you can't just put on a new pair of shoes and expect to be teleported to self-actualization.   at least, that's what I think."

"Lol, I need to finish your videos before I comment. I'm a nonbinary person and I like to think I have a unique taste. My favorite aesthetic is messy hair, but like, shockingly messy. And I adore the gothic aesthetic. But sometimes I feel a sort of conflict between the black and white aesthetic and my darker skin. And then I feel guilty for using white foundation, but I'm not doing it to erase my skin color. I'm doing it to meet an aesthetic standardized by society and fashion. And also to look dead or otherworldly. Lol. But this video helped pull that internalized racism from the back of my head and face it. So Im going to try and redesign my character Oliver to show my darker complexion and say fuck you to established goth fashion."

"Your analysis used to be more in depth. You aren't doing psychoanalysis, you are regurgitating pop sociology. Go back to your old standards, even if it is with a new look."
"huh. I was talking with my friend just the other day about how hard it is to be an ugly person and knowing that no matter how much weight I lose and makeup I put on I will never be attractive. it's really, REALLY hard. people do not treat me the same as they treat other people- i am just not looked at in the way other women are looked at. and it's just great that if I were a cis guy I could just work out, get a decent haircut and wear deodorant and no group of drunken men would come up to me on the street at 10pm just to tell me im ''''unfuckable'''''  and ask me why I even came out ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"That intro editing is very pleasing :D"
"I haven't watched the full video yet. In fact I'm only at 0:42, but I must say DAMN, QUEEN! FUCK IT UP!! <33333"
"What is the background track that plays from 22:33 to 24:03? I know it's classical but can't put my finger on it"
"Being beautiful (for me) is a way to seek people's approval, and am messed up and I resent people's approval, therefore I have no desire to look good and I don't try. Does this mean there is something wrong with me or is there something wrong with everyone else? It's probably me, but I really have no idea. One day I am going to be ugly, and after that, I'll be dead. So why care about shallow superficial opinions about something as meaningless as looks?   Humans. They are obsessed with what they see in front of them; boobs, skin color, TV, food pictures on instagram. I don't know what more meaningful things there are to care about, I just get sick of the surface things like the beauty magazines and the celebrity gossip. You can still like those things and be a wonderful person, but for someone like me who isn't interested, people look at me as uncool and a sloppy untrendy loser. Good. Better than wasting my time trying to conform to a world I have no interest in."
"Fox capitalist propaganda has already decided that Trump is done, they need a Democrat to take the fall for the effect of the tax breaks, so you don't get to brick, you just need to participate in the cycle of capitalist bi-populism so that you can be heartbroken yet again as the anointed Democrat again saves capitalism, at the cost of creating to the right wing backlash later.  Either that or America will abandon democracy altogether if Trumps authoritarian regime succeeds, in which case a brick will be insufficient at which point the 'fake lefts' pacifism and gun phobia will lead to easy genocide."
"Wait, does that make me a lesbian?  I’m a bi cis male who dislikes beauty obsession...  lol"
"u look like Taylor swift but hotter I'm-"
"congrats, you look like Carly Fiorina!"
"I remember first encountering Contrapoints when I first got into political YT several months ago on the Incels video. I didn’t get very far into the video unfortunately, but I thought 100% that she was a woman. This was at a time when I still held onto the belief that there were only 2 genders. A few weeks later, I started watching more vids and enjoyed all of them until I eventually got to a video where she said she was a trans woman. I was thoroughly shocked. I had absolutely no idea and it would’ve never crossed my mind. Many thanks to Contra for providing content and sharing her experience so people can learn not only about politics, but on gender and sexuality. It certainly helped me to accept the trans community, and I’ll never not see Contra as a woman. I have a friend who’s transitioning from female to male, and I’m not sure I would’ve been able to accept it without her videos. Thank you Contrapoints for everything you do.  I apologize if anything here is problematic in any way. I’ll be more than happy to alter/delete if needed"

"this is a step in the right direction but i still think youre too fixated on beauty standards and on overblown negative opinions about you"
"really fascinating to me as a woman who has never felt too involved with beauty (mostly from issues of ignorance/apathy, not any immunity to the constant pressures modern society exerts on feminine and other bodies) the closer you hew to that paragon of, y'know, Unaffected and Unconcerned feminine beauty, the more instinctive and nitpicky my own judgement is....I'm on an unwanted journey from some sort of senseless, dog-panting /wow ur so hot/ to this automatic breakdown of a female face. I'm Not Happy this is what my mind does but there we go"
"Y'know, I never realized until you brought it up that lesbians don't have the same compulsion to make ourselves look a certain way that other queer identities do, or at least those things are very easily changeable like hair and clothes. I feel like it probably has a lot to do with feminism and the rejection of traditional beauty standards though it, but the idea is so new to me that I don't know how to articulate it yet."
"25:10, radfems tell you what’s next. Stop wearing makeup, stop shaving, stop dieting and put yourself through the agony of being conventionally ugly until you stop caring and learn to love yourself"

"I love you"
"Hey Natalie,   I know you've heard it all before, but thanks so much for doing what you do. In a couple really short years I've gone from being kind of a shitty 'well but what about IQ TESTS HUH?' proto-fascist tweenage brat to being a totally lost, baffled college kid, but that college kid takes a lot of solace in the fact that people as kind, as clever, and as honest as you are garnering this kind of following in the world. It's too easy to condemn and to problematize and to shout really loud about how right we all are, but to question yourself -- and to question yourself on camera! -- takes a lot of guts. I support you and admire you and wish you so much happiness in your lovely new ('new?') self <3"
"You are beautiful"
"wow I was just gonna get bangs but I think I'm getting facial feminization surgery now"
"I always wish more things were 'biological'. Biology seems to be so much easier to change than society."

"Can you comment on trans women in sports?"
"Contra ASMR.  Also Natalie is beautiful"
"That sophie opening is actually killer"
"this video is fucking unbearable to watch. how can someone who previously was genderqueer erase nonbinary people and talk in binarist enbyphobic ways? just because you turned out to be a woman you're suddenly above us and think we can be erased? also there's no such thing as 'looking female' but yeah thanks for fucking over all afab nonbinary people and trans men. your privilege is fucking showing."

"Thanks! My goal in life is to get in the way of people crudely over generalizing people based on gender. 😉"
"Thank you for making this video. I've always struggled with Body dysmorphic disorder as a teen, and my whole shtick is that I have to be thin as a twig, because all young, attractive teenage women are thin as a twig, and if I'm not thin as a twig I'm an ugly, fat failure. What is even more ridiculous is that I find other women who are overweight or curvy completely normal and beautiful, and if I were to somehow detach from my body and view it as someone else, I would probably think, 'Wow, look at that totally normal girl who has a normal weight and is not at all horrendously fat.' At my lowest point, I legitimately started to think I should actively try and become anorexic. Thankfully, some sense was still left in me, and at that point I realized I needed to stop obsessing so hard over the fact that my stomach wasn't as flat as a my hair, and it's probably just going to stay that way no matter how many times I glare at it in a mirror.   I do believe representation works, because every time I see a woman who is plus-size, curvy, or simply has a little chub who is admired by society, it chips away at the feeling that I'm not good enough if I'm not thin enough. Watching your videos and seeing the way you present yourself with all the glamour and no apologies has also inspired me to accept myself and my own beauty. You are an inspiration to awkward teen girls everywhere, and you can totally believe me when I say you're genuinely beautiful, because, like, I never lie about these things so you can 100% trust me."
"As a male with a lot of self-image issues, this video helped me look at myself in a different light and understand a bit more about why i feel the way i do. This video was mostly focused on the struggles faced by women in this area, but i'm glad i was able to get a lot out of it too."
"Another video I am relieved and happy to see. I love how down to earth you are"
"I truly appreciate your sense of humor and content. Always a pleasure to view. You look great btw"
"“incels are cancelled” FINALLY"
"Goddammit, that was a Fear and Loathing quote wasn't it? I've often wondered if you're channeling a bit of Hunter's spirit."

"You're friggin gorgeous. Keep doin you ya God dam poet!"
"WE LOVE SOPHIE"
"Natalie, we SO need you right now. Not just your intelligence but your humor, wit, and BEAUTY. As a ciS wOmAn, I love and respect the confidence, courage, and pride of trans women so much. Especially women like you. You make me proud to be a woman. You are goals ❤❤❤"

"Still a guy sorry"
"I didn't know Villanelle had a YouTube channel. 😍"
"Wow that is such a cool intro!"
"As a femme lesbian who has never chilled out in her entire life, we're obsessed with our looks too. In this house we stan the butches who don't give a shit."
"This video is absurdly unfocused. After having watched I'm not even sure I could describe what it's about to someone who hasn't seen it."
"Beauty is subjective, so if you are trying to be objectively beautiful, you’ll never get there.  And for what it’s worth, you have a unique style I have not seen elsewhere online before.  13:52 Aquarium from Carnival of the Animals is so underrated."

"More politics pls"
"WOW Natalie, you look AMAZING."

"I’m visually impaired so I’m blessed to not be able to see how ugly I am—or anyone else is for that matter. Basically what I’m saying is, if the world was visually impaired beauty standards would be better but we’d all be running into each other."
"I think your voice has changed a little bit."
"Looking great Natalie, but you always did. Love your refreshing honesty on this and yes it is a confusing mindset and even harder to describe to somebody else. Starting my own transition a year ago, being ten years older than you and bald headed for twenty of those years. A bald women with perfect makeup is atleast to me, the most honest I've been with myself my whole life and a suitable punishment for being married and fathering four children (ah that cry to be normal). Of course, my fully supportive children think I need to wear a wig as perfect makeup doesn't cut it in the real world, and so does my counsellor. I have mixed emotions about wearing a mask for 38yrs only to put on another one for the second half of my life, but yeah, being beautiful matters :)"
"ContraPoints ASMR! 💕"
"As a trans girl who's been diagnosed with both gender dysphoria and body dysmorphia, this video really hit home. Even I'm sometimes unsure if I'm pursuing a particular surgery or cosmetic treatment because I want to feminise my appearance or because I want to beautify it. Thanks for such a nuanced discussion of this topic."
"if you do an ASMR i will give you money and never ask that you do another."
"SOPHIE? Nice"
"Style (and beauty) is about perspective. Nature is beautiful, and it's chock full of shit you don't want to look at. Bugs and worms. Things that ooze. Gross! But we still think it's beautiful. Maybe the reason you don't feel beautiful is that you aren't looking at the right parts of yourself."

"nobody can say they have 'no style' while serving that much sequin"
"Honestly, speaking as a fan but also speaking as a critic, I do not believe you are cloackable. I think it would take someone to seriously closely and desperately look at you to find a masculine structure. The facial surgery definitely helped."
"I thought you looked great before ffs, and I think you look amazing after too! Love your makeup in this vid :)"
"Oh Natalie... please believe me when I say, you are (and have always been, but are now even more femininely so) an obnoxiously lovely and ridiculously sexy woman. (It can be a bit irritating that you have to be intellectually attractive as well - but... I won't hold that against you.) I know that you know you're beautiful, but I don't mind telling you anyways. You're beautiful, Natalie. Wonder no longer. (waves magic wand)"
"Contrapoints asmr when?"
"I don’t know whether this is valuable info to you, but when I first saw your video on incels I thought you were unearthly hot and wasn’t aware that you were trans until you said so. Your FFS was executed beautifully, and I hope you are happy with it as well!!"
"I always love a good Lindsay Ellis reference. The only thing that could be more obvious is if you said that you were losing to a bird."

One wolf, is the one who just wants to smoke meth all day, talking about government conspiracies, and using their powers to rape mexicans. And the other wolf, the number two wolf, is more or less trying to mind his own business, and you don't have to worry about him too much.' 'Okay.' 'Now listen, because I'm unlikely to remember all this shit tomorrow.' 'I'm listening. I'm listening.' 'Wolves. Ain't Got. No. Fucking. Friends, Alright? I ever find out you gave money to a wolf, I'll put more than a couple of fucking dogs inside you. I will fuck up your entire life.' 'I got it. I got it.' 'And son?' 'Yeah?' 'Don't raise them to be fags, okay?' 'I promise.'"

"'We sat upon a bench, placed for the sake of one of these views, whence we looked down upon the waterfall, and over the open country ... A lady and gentleman, more expeditious tourists than ourselves, came to the spot; they left us at the seat, and we found them again at another station above the Falls. Coleridge, who is always good-natured enough to enter into conversation with anybody whom he meets in his way, began to talk with the gentleman, who observed that it was a majestic waterfall. Coleridge was delighted with the accuracy of the epithet, particularly as he had been settling in his own mind the precise meaning of the words grand, majestic, sublime, etc., and had discussed the subject with William at some length the day before. “Yes, sir,” says Coleridge, “it is a majestic waterfall.” “Sublime and beautiful,” replied his friend. Poor Coleridge could make no answer, and, not very desirous to continue the conversation, came to us and related the story, laughing heartily.'"
"'we critique things', no, you come up with elaborate excuses to deny the reality of the world.  Blaming beauty standards on 'patriarchy',  come on now, you may as well blame god because beauty standards are based on evolutionary forces.  Before anyone tries the old 'look at the old art of fatties' or points at abstract fertility statues, go look at Micheangelo's Pieta and then come back.  Elite tastes have always been fringe, unrepresentative of the norms of their day, look at modern art being sold for millions, however when artists were tasked with glorifying god to the masses, that is when you saw the truth of what was always beautiful.  Jesus's mother was depicted as not just unnaturally young, but thin and beautiful, that is the truth your 'critiques' deny."
"Honestly, I can't tell the difference between the first skin product & the subsequent ones. Whether that's because they're superfluous or I have a bad eye for makeup is another question entirely."
"Thank you for the Hunter Thompson reference, it did not go unappreciated"
"You know, talk smack about cis white straight males all you want, but at least they're honest. One time a guy said to me, 'Those two girls are too annoying for how little pretty they are.' Kinda a dick thing to say, but we all do it some extent, and most people probably do it to the same extent he does, they just don't know it or say it.  Also, it's not only your responsibility to care less about how you look, it's also up to other people to judge you less on your looks. I feel like all the 'you're so beautiful!' comments are kinda counter productive, since it reduces your importance to just your physical appearance rather than content of character.  Speaking of which, great video! I really love the rawer, more honest approach.  Also, the more ad-libbed, deadpan, mundane dialogue is usually a sign to me of a YouTube channel becoming insufferably self-indulgent, but yet you somehow managed to pull it off tastefully, and I'm not trying to flatter here. That's seriously impressive!"

"I liked as soon as I heard faceshop!"
"'Hi sister 'cels.'   - ded."
"Never thought I get a Fear and Loathing reference in one of these. Kudos to you. Also funniest episode ever"
"When I first watched on episode of your videos, I thought you were a cis-woman. It wasn't until you mentioned being transgender that I realised you weren't cis. You were feminine then and you're feminine now, and you were gorgeous then and you're gorgeous now. . And even if you don't believe me, sincere though I am,I hope the shot of dopamine helps."
"it might just be facial blindness talking but u look so different"
"Wow that’s a huge change in profile...I will miss your other you but you still look like a version of yourself. You look good. I thought you looked really girlie before. You are always a woman to me! Glad your happy with your results. Congrats!"
"That intro was fucking awesome.    The rest of the video was good too or whatever."
"underrated. class A content creator, you are"
"The comparison about to be eyelid surgerie quite weird because I don't think (my personal opinion)  it is motivated by Western beauty standards. Korea wear such surgery is very common has strict beauty standards of their own thats seem to be clearly traceable to the past. Like paleness just like in europe was attractive because it was a sign of nobility it meant he didn't have to go out, work in the fields and get a tan, but this opinion wasn't  held because it was held in Europe, it seems like they came up with it on their own. It's just a shity beauty standard. Just like my Russian ass is lifting the eyebrow as hard as it can in my profile picture to make my eyes seem bigger because my siberian add mixture makes them hooded and small."

"Texto traducido por traductor  I'm saying that I liked the video and what I like most about your videos is that I reflect.   said this I wonder what will happen in a couple of years and you see this video, what will happen to you and what will you feel.  Beauty and self knowledge go hand in hand.  I wonder where you will persist and how you will change completely and I wonder if I will continue to see you in the same way"
"I came to ContraPoints here for the political analysis, not this."
"This video was stellar and worth the wait. I laughed so much."

"A book on etiquete from the 1920ies said: 'You cannot make yourself more beautiful but you can make yourself more pleasant' and there is some truth to it. There was this one guy who was short and overweight so definitely not the conventional beauty type but even the most prissy queens flocked to him. He wore tailor fit clothes (both casual outfits as well as suits) so the clothes he was wearing, while nothing outrageous were always flattering (not too tight so that he looked like a sausage, not too flappy like wearing a tent), his hair was always nice and he always was wearing subtle perfumes. On top of that he was such a pleasant, outgoing character. that it was such a pleasure to hang around with him. In short, he did what Natalie said, cultivating an aestetic and it did work."
"You finer than Colonel Sander’s finger lickin’ chicken."
"I miss the political dialectic and the theater of the absurd. Whatever happened to Tabby and Abigail and Jackie Jackson :( ?"
"i am a girl who is attracted to girls and i am genuinely attracted to the real no makeup (ill) look.. and i also think you look really good with no makeup at all :) (and u also don't pass any less). but i also apply conventional beauty standards to myself more than what i find attractive in others. i guess maybe it's easier to appreciate real beauty when it's not tainted with a desire to meet the standards of an arbitrary idea of what other ppl find attractive.. would love to be able to appreciate those same subtleties i find attractive in others in myself more. it's like a different way of seeing. non critically, and with love, i guess."
"Hearing your thought process is super interesting and validating! My overthinking ass loves hearing you process your wants and their context outwardly as well as inward. I'm so glad you're healing and everything went okay with your surgery! 💕 Also you look fucking beautiful"
"Real talk your eye makeup in this video is wonderful, and that’s not just flattery 💕"
"I think you need to put an epilepsy warning on the beginning of this, FYI"
"this video made me want to post weird bullshit in the comments then it ended and I almost came to my senses"
"Love this! I had my FFS on april 9th and this is exactly the video I need in my life right now :)"
"I miss your old nose."
"Beauty is an unobtainable goal, I've embraced the d dull self loathing of acceptance. That being said I think you're very beautiful, the more I've learned about your astounding intelligence, your glib and self deprecating humor enhances that beauty. Loved the Hunter S. Thompson  reference!"
"Honestly the surgery wasn't needed Nat. But I hope you like the results. Thank you for your videos, they're always 10/10."
"Thank you for doing what you do! You are very pretty, very smart, and wildly hilarious. As a Nihilistic Pan Male you give me such joy! Thank you!"

"Don’t ever change Natalie."
"For some reason this episode left me in a darker place than any of the previous videos. I'll be fine, but just realizing the futility of adopting or rejecting beauty standards has left me shook. Going to be thinking about this for a while..."
"That intro was so sick I had to rewatch it like 20 times."
"nice"
"most relatable quote 'its hard being a six' XD also found this video very thought provoking, as a person recovering from body dysmorphia I honestly sometimes wonder if gender dysphoria and body dysmorphia are at all related on a psychological level. Thanks again for the video!"
"I cried, thank you Natalie."
"Is that augmented minecraft music at the end???"
"You nailed it. It's all about style, and babe? You've got style!"
"Wow, what timing. I go in for my consultation in 8 days, and my surgery will be 6 weeks after! I hope it goes as well as yours :3"
"Oh my God I love your sequin dress"
"Well I'm gay so I don't know how to rate your prettiness either, but I think you look really pretty. Also, I'm gay, and I don't want any surgery. I guess I'm kind of a bear, and gay bears have great body positivity!"
"Natalie isn’t a “Gigi Gorgeous super sexy Instagram model” type of beautiful, and I hope she doesn’t think she needs to be. She reminds me of an elegant, graceful, stylish actress or queen— and it’s really refreshing. When she looked in the mirror and her long neck and collarbones were showing, all I could think of was that she looked like an elegant queen. ❤️ Then she has that beautiful wisdom, humor, charm, and thoughtfulness about her that makes her seem even more regal. Natalie, if you are reading this, you are one the most beautiful, intelligent women I’ve ever had the privilege of seeing. You have had such a big impact on the way I view the world and the eloquence of my arguments when dealing with fascist, racist, sexist, incel, transphobic buffoons. Much love ❤️"
"from Karen to Stacey in one month.  You go girl!"
"Thank you."
"Your videos are so good. Seems like you go so deep into the psyche when people's self reflection is some surface level, for-social-media bullshit. Thanks for a repeated job exceptionally done. I feel like only you, Vince Staples, and JillisBlack truly see things with the wise eyes of older leaders in these times. It's inspiring for real. Thanks, Nat."

"I think this idea that you shouldn't care at all how you look is flawed view largely stemming to the idea of body as a mere vessel for you rather than inescapable part. This especially true for more privileged people: women, PoC, trans people and people with disabilities are less able to abstract themselves is way because they often have navigate around the ways people perceive them.     Your body is a part of you and it is good to look after yourself. Dressing and presenting in a way that makes you happy is self-care. As someone into alt-fashion, the idea that people only dress-up to impress is laughable. Sometimes the look that makes you happy, others don't like, or even mock, but if it really makes you happy, you put up with it, because the price is worth it.   Hot, attractive... Often I have trouble defining these things enough in others. The best feeling I've gotten from my appearance was the feeling of being a living art piece, like my every movement had meaning and that I something more, better than myself.     But, something, something, arousal and ripe fruit."
"8.5/10 for content, 10/10 for S T Y L E"
"Honestly, I give you an 8. I think you're a bit hard on yourself.   Though really it's all subjective as different people will have different reactions to different aesthetics. Beauty may have various agreed upon directions, but there is no such thing as universal beauty, or even objective beauty. So I guess in that regard numbers are meaningless. The only way to really judge your own beauty is to do so comparatively with yourself as a measure of progress. And that without getting into the less tangible aspects such as self confidence or positivity that can add their own, in my unsolicited opinion greater, factor to beauty.   Then again I'm ace so maybe I'm on a completely different train lol"
"ngl sometimes i think the only reason i identify as nonbinary is because i can't find any other way to say, 'i am actually lowkey maybe a little traumatized by how much i used to depend on consistently performing femininity to feel attractive and worthy of love, so i've spent the last few years consciously putting distance between myself and gendered expectations of beauty. now, i feel very alienated from the female experience.'"

"relatable and refreshing. have had so much shame about wanting to be beautiful, and also wanting to meet beauty standards which i know are oppressive constructs of patriarchy etc. agree it is futile to try to not want to be beautiful, but you can practice shifting your focus away from it. i personally avoid mirrors as much as possible. and try to stay in touch with how i feel instead of thinking about how i appear. which is admittedly really hard. also must be so hard when you're a youtuber! i thought about making youtube content before but couldn't because it was too hard to look at myself. also agree about style and i do try to have that approach. but having to worry about how people gender you kind of makes it impossible to not care about looking 'female' (cis) enough. maybe that approach is more possible once u pass? maybe.."

Maybe part of learning to be happy is learning that an 'alright' level of control is good enough. It seems that chasing an ideal of anything, be it beauty or anything else, is always going to result in feelings of inadequacy. Of course the problem is that we're constantly being fed these ideals from every corner of the media, which is bound to have an effect on us eventually, like you say, even if we can analyse it. I mean we can all say 'you look great' (which you do in my opinion) or equally say nasty things but it's about which voices you are really affected by and how that feeds into this ultimately unattainable ideal. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't want to see you destroy your body, so maybe an end point would be a good idea to set out."
"Natalie, you always seem to say exactly what I need to hear exactly when you need to hear it. I am in my final year of an English BA and absolutely saturated in nonstop critique, so naturally the past few months have been a slow spiral into despair/resignation/hamlet-type-shit.  I even discovered your channel in a midst of a leftist politics deep dive that I conducted as a result of critique-induced frenzy. It sometimes feels like the only way to live a morally appropraite life is absolute self-abnegation in all respects, attempting to adhere to every critique and repress anything that goes against them. Not that critique isn't valuable, but a life driven solely by critique and not pleasure or delight is hardly one worth living, and I fucking respect you for embodying that/reminding us plebs. In summation: you're a goddess and choke me mommy"

"Though I love this channel, I wish she ventured into other subjects like she did before. The last 5 videos were all on the same topic. I know this is close to home for her and I think the videos are still good, but I miss videos exposing 'skeptics' and right wing conspiracies"
"Im sorry but the description of ffs by the skull lady was so asmr-inducing"
"MY FACE IS THE FRONT OF SHOP"
"It’s interesting that I saw this now because I went through this exact same dilemma just now. While I’m neither trans, nor a woman, nor did I have surgery (yeah, another straight, cis, white dude adding his 2 privileged cents), I still rarely feel attractive to the point where it really hurts my self-confidence. I’m very skinny and in no way fit the ideal man standard (aka Captain America). BUT being in a relationship with someone that finds me physically attractive (and otherwise) makes me feel better and makes feel like I should be kinder and more accepting of myself. While I can always improve (aka dropping 50 bucks on skin care products that may not work [yes, I know but it’s a lot for a dude]), just knowing that there are people who think I am attractive as is is awesome and I think that the fact that people are expressing their attraction to you (i.e me) is something in itself.   Ps: yes, this is written with the awareness that beauty standards for men in this capitalist-driven patriarchal society is significantly lower than for women. So instead if feeling beautiful once a month, it’s more like twice a month."

"You look so young! Are you a student"
"I just wanted to say that the first time I saw you was in your video 'Incels', and you passed. The only reason I suspected you were trans was your attitudes and beliefs. Basically, 'No way a cis white chick is this woke'. You are also the reason I have left my shitty, post-op only attitude behind. I realized that I'm attracted to strong women, period. You've made the female penis so much less intimidating for me. Not that it matters, I'm def in the 'secretly love a woman from afar, and die inside' stage. Why do straight women exist??"
"amazing work as always. im so happy for you!!!!"
"This is the last place I would expect a fear and loathing joke. I love you so much"
"Have you thought about doing a video on minimalism? I have seen many people critique the aesthetics of minimalism and the way it focuses on individual action over collective change, and I think you could add some cool stuff to those conversations too, but I would be particularly interested in your take on the particular ways in which people 'minimize in order to do what they love' (a classic example: live out of a backpack in order to be that rich white guy on vacation in Southeast Asia for three years, or to start yet another fricking podcast, instead of helping their communities with their spare time), because of how good you are at explaining the shitty sources of desires while also understanding why people still hold on to them."
"You look very nice. You always looked very nice. You definately look more feminine now, which is a perfectly fine goal to have if that is what you want. If you wanted to alter your look, however little or however much, more power to you and if that makes you feel better, then that's great."

"That bit about academia really hit home for me. I just graduated (thank christ) from a masters program and after observing the differences between the male and female professors and fellow students, I've become even more convinced that this whole frigging system is rigged. My male professors often showed up looking more like students than we did, while my female professor (there were only three total, so not a huge sample) was always dressed sharply and professional, but she was often left out of the decision making for the program. One of my classmates wore graphic tees and jeans the whole time he taught a class and no one said shit, where as when I taught and wore makeup and what I thought were nice clothes, I got called dramatic in my student reviews. I was the only woman in the department who wore visible, over-the-top (according to some) makeup, and it felt really alienating that this art form that I've come to really enjoy put me as an outsider and made people judge me before I had a chance to open my mouth.  But it's also made me realize that none of it matters, I'm gonna get shit either way, so I might as well wear the swamp green eyeshadow if I want."
"Good lord you’re deep in it aren’t you? You guys have a derogatory slang word for just about anything regarding sex or gender... I couldn’t live in your world... it would give me a headache.

"You equate beauty/vanity with being female, and then say that you don’t feel beautiful ie you don’t feel like you’re the “pretty rich girl” your autogynephilic mind thinks you are, you even admit it is all psychological, not physical. The thing is, you’re a man. You weren’t socialized into femininity and so the only thing you think makes a woman is makeup and nails and dresses and superficial bullshit. You see women as vanity. That’s why it doesn’t make sense to you that women might not want to perform femininity. You can only think of being a woman the way men do, externally and superficially. You don’t understand that when a woman doesn’t not perform femininity she is treated differently and has been peer and self regulated to do so, even in prison. However, you can perform femininity and be a man, anyone can perform femininity, because femininity isn’t what makes women women. Anything else is misogyny."

Wow... Wonder what songs might drift into my head through the next 2/3rds of Natalie's latest life lesson..."

"'I'm aware the conventional beauty standards are a racist, sexist, ableist, fat-phobic, trans-phobic social construct designed to preserve power relations and sell products. But does that awareness mean I desire any less to be conventionally beautiful? Well, no, I want it more than ever.' Instead of doing intellectual back-flips to justify your pursuit of beauty to the woke crowd, why not just think like a conservative and admit beauty is inherent (not a social construct), which allows you to seek after it without the associated guilt?"
"U literally look like yourself but cunty. So good"
"as a cis woman, i know my own avoidance of being traditionally “beautiful” comes from resentment of being taught that all my value as a woman comes from my appearence. i don’t begrudge other women for being concerned with beauty, but i do begrudge the standards of beauty that’s put on us— i can’t buy that at least a part of women’s desires to look traditionally beautiful doesn’t come from an unconscious desire to appeal to society standards. i dunno, i have a limited viewpoint but that’s how i feel. Love the hell out of that ending tho"
"'F'. I died (literally)"
"The part with all the overlapping 'my journey' audio was giving me some serious 'I'm Poppy!' vibes"
"Instead of looking for flaws like “my nose is too big” or “my eyes are uneven” (some things I used to hate about myself) I suggest you take a second and just say out loud something you did right in your view of beauty. Saying it is important because words help develop our views of ourselves. That’s how I stopped hating my reflection. I’m not in love with myself, but I can always find something I like. Good luck with your self love journey."
"As a middle aged cis white dude i only fix my look to look more healthy and masculine if i need to do business as buy car, go to car repair shop or do business with a plumber or electrician. SO basically i make my self look !better' when i got with men to do, mostly because to prevent them to think they can rip me off. Shall i go to a doctor or my psychiatrist i dress sloppy and let me look weak and sick, mostly because it help me get the help i need. I am a happy married due so dress up to impress on girls/women do i not feel the need to do, but i dress up to help my wife feel more secure when she need to met her friends or do things important for her. Basically am i then an accessory for her. She do similar things so it seem looks are more important when it come to your own sex, gender to preserve status."
"I missed miss Natalie Wynn"
"You are indeed beautiful"
"You look really good ContraPoints. I'm a cis woman and i've thought of these things as well. I feel fat, my boobs are too big for the rest of my body, I have baby rosy cheeks. 'If only I lost the weight.' 'if only i got a reduction.' 'if only if only...' My boyfriend tells me I'm beautiful but I don't REALLY believe him.  I don't really have any advice, but I'm glad you're back. We should both go to counseling XD"
"I do... Care about being 'Beautiful,' even if most people think I don't, but I've strongly backlashed against it because of how I was abused as a child, not given food, being screamed at in dressing rooms. 'Why can't you be pretty like your sisters?' 'Ugly girl,' 'Fat girl,' that I went the complete opposite direction. It was cemented when I was raped by my first (and only) boyfriend. I decided, fuck you. You think I'm ugly now? You ain't SEEN ugly yet.  I refuse to shave or wear makeup. I've gained a lot of weight. I deliberately wear clashing clothes. Sometimes I go five or more days between showers. I wish I could say it worked. I wish I could say it keeps me safe. But it doesn't. Just a few weeks ago I was cornered in the mall elevator by some young men who called me 'fatty' and 'big belly' and I was so afraid someone would try to touch me or hurt me. I was shaking by the time the elevator got to my floor and I hurried into the nearest shop. They followed me, but eventually left. It keeps me safe because men usually leave me alone. But 'usually' doesn't mean 'always.'"
"Just realised I rolled over into my 2 year sobriety date watching this video!! Wouldn't have wanted to spend this moment with anyone else (seriously rather be with someone parasocially after 11:30pm..) thanks for being up front in  your videos about your own struggles with alcahol! Sounds like you're doing amazing, so happy for you"
"yeah not knowing if you're pretty when you looking in the mirror is body dysmorphia, sadly to say i think there's a big overlap between gender dysphoria and body dysmorphia, and i know that because your gender dysmorphia video triggered the hell out of me even though im very cis, whoops   PS you look so hot marry me pls"

"Gina Linetti irl, I fucking love you"
"Thought I'd share this: The med/tech school I go to is predominantly female. Girl, you know we wear makeup for ourselves. It let's me know they feel good about themselves, they radiate it, and onlookers give recognition. I love to see people present themselves in however their current physical best. It's not about trying to impress. Makeup is a tool the same way clothes are a tool. Even our skills to socialize is a tool. These are just outward extensions (or expressions) of ourselves that help people see it in a different forms.   As for bone structure... all my sister's have defined yet feminine. Mine is diminished in comparison. At first glance, it curves more feminine than theirs, but it honestly makes me look anorexic in comparison. My mandible doesn't accommodate the amount of teeth I have. It's overcrowded, crooked, even with all wisdom teeth out.  The upper hard palate of my mouth is warped and the TMJ has given me migraines for years. I got the slim jawline of my dad's family and the somewhat large teeth from my mother's side. Genetics is so weird.   If you're at all familiar with Roger Scruton's book on Beauty, I suggest you read it and let me know if you think it's useful. I've found it to help me out when I felt super ugly and thought my art major was stupid.   (Sorry, it's sooooo long)"

"Thank you for being brutally honest about this, and about how getting surgery didn't magically change your feelings. My 2 cents for anyone struggling with this, as someone who's mostly recovered from an eating disorder and used to lock myself in the house for weeks at a time because I thought I was too ugly to go outside, is you gotta consciously change your thoughts. I used to be so self-conscious about my bumpy crooked nose until I started looking up women who had the same thing, seeing how beautiful they are, and deciding to look in the mirror and tell myself I have a powerful Roman goddess nose and my bump is where I store my power. It feels fake at first, but the feeling becomes genuine over time. It's also a good practice to find things you like about strangers. I've noticed that the more I see other people and their flaws as beautiful, which imo is easier than doing it to yourself at first, the more that attitude leaks into looking in the mirror.  Funny to think this method that actually worked for me was in direct contrast to what I experienced in a psychiatric hospital after a suicide attempt. The nurses actually considered it a sign of improvement when women put on makeup, did their hair, etc. I wasn't allowed to have sci fi books, but makeup and hair tools with supervision was fine. This was a really weird and harmful message to get as a suicidal, anorexic, and self-conscious teenage girl. The men's mental health wasn't measured by how visually presentable they were. Even if it's not about attracting men for sex, I wonder how much women are taught that we have to appealing for other people in general. And thats how 'my pores are big' is turned into 'I'm not acceptable as a human female'.   I find certain aspects of beauty fun, like eyeliner and playing with hairstyles and fashion, but I dont hate how I look without them. Every human is statistically a miracle just for existing, so, like, who cares that I have a weak chin. The trees and lizards certainly don't give a shit, so I'm gonna try not to either.  Idk this turned into an essay  because I've been thinking about it  a lot lately. I really think unconditional self-love is one of the most powerful tools for change in ourselves and the world, but it's a skill that has to be practiced."

"I’m very glad you love what you see in the mirror—or at least that you’ve achieved a normalized level of self-loathing. 😁 In all seriousness, you look great. Don’t feel guilty. As long as you are actually able to enjoy being you for five minutes, it’s worth a lot. Creativity and aesthetics exist in the twilight, in the ambiguous in between. And isn’t that a good place to be?"

"My connection to beauty and my body is so wild as a trans man not planning on medically transitioning. Especially because I'm very busty. Like, I want to be recognized as Male by other people and have my pronouns respected, but I have soft features and big tits that I don't want to get rid of, and I like wearing pink and dresses. It's like! Fuck! Do I want to wear something that I personally think is very cute and makes me look good, or do I want to have even a HOPE of being respected as being trans? I feel like I have to PERFORM as some tortured soul that hates my body just to get people to listen to me when I say that I'm a boy- that I have to act like I WANT to transition even though I DON'T just to be respected! It's frustrating and uncomfortable and confusing."
"this was only wonderful up to 'it must needs be remarked that the skull of the chad...', at which point perfection was attained"
"Okay, someone fill me in. Who the fuck is James Charles? And more importantly, am I going to regret asking that?"
"I just wanted to say that I admire you and your sense of humor so much because it all comes from a place of vulnerability that is kinda hard to expose, specially when you are being an ~~~influencer~~~~. As a cis grad girl student, some comments hit hard and it also made me think a lot on the ways that our perception of our own beauty limits of expands our horizons - I also don’t think of myself as a beautiful person , and I try not to think about it and I don’t admit that I don’t see myself as conventionally beautiful in order to not put myself in this vulnerable position, but at the same time I refrain myself from doing things or talking to people because I am a 7 on a good day and I am afraid of 9 and 10s even if I say that beauty is a social construct lol. Anyway, thank you so much for this :) I hope that you have a smoother recovery this month!!"

"sophie at the beginning? work"
"I've always felt the conflict that you were talking about of being aware of how problematic society's impossible beauty standards are while still wanting desperately to conform to them, now more than ever. I moved to Maui about a year ago and now I'm pressuring myself to live up to beauty standards that I never cared about before. If you would've asked me a year ago what I thought about tanning, I would've said it's pointless and a good way to get cancer, but now I obsess over it. In fact, just today, I spent hours on the beach in the sun, because everyone here is so tan and it's a different standard than Colorado, so now it's another thing I'm self conscious about. And then of course there's the issue of having a perfect 'bikini body'. I've always been naturally skinny and never really had a problem with disliking my body before this year, but now I absolutely despise my stomach and spend so much time looking at other girls and wishing I looked like them. Ironically, it was just yesterday that I lectured someone on the importance of representation of different body types in the media, and then turned around and skipped lunch before going to the beach."
"Not only are you a wonderful woman who I've developed a slow-burn crush on over the months, but your dialogues have helped me not only understand my own sexuality and identity, but the identities and sexualities of my loved ones. Your video essay a little while back concerning cis straight men engaging in relationships with trans women opened my eyes in a way I will always thank you for. Also, I appreciated, 'Once you get locked into a serious skincare collection, the tendency is to take it all the way.' 10/10 please keep making videos forever"
"Okay I'm a little frustrated. I'm a transwoman too just FYI for this minor critique. Also I think this was a great video as always.  I've supported Contra since back when she was pissing off 9/11 truthers and calling herself Nycotine. I will continue to support her... But FFS (not the kind this video is about).  In recent videos she has made small but repeated digs about how the members of the trans community are treating her bad. Sometimes implying how people in the trans community are some kind of unempathetic, negging, hive mind.  I get that someone reading other people's opinions that it would feel like there is a mass against you and I can't even begin to imagine what effect that has.... But we aren't a homogenous blob of the same opinion.   Look it's wrong that the internet is so critical and pushes all these expectations on prople. I know I'm only adding to that by putting more critique out there. I know it hurts more when it comes from people who share experiences with you.  None of this changes the fact that this perpetuation of viewing trans people as the enemy of contrapoints is total BS. That's the real internalised transphobia right there.   Never have I been more free to speak uncensored than since coming out in the trans community. Sure I get people disagreeing with me all the time. I'd put money on people disagreeing with this comment. (Especially since I am wording it like a total asshole) That doesn't mean that the people who disagree with me are trying to force me into conformity. That doesn't mean that the people disagreeing with me don't have a point.   What I find strange about this is I think that Natalie displays an extreme self awareness of her internalised prejudices when she is discussing them on her own terms. But when discussing how trans people have criticized her o feel a level of contempt that pigeonholes any trans person who has disagreements with her point of view.   Maybe I'm reading into shit. Maybe I'm projecting. But I don't know if I can accept seeing the contra fans who shit on the trans people who felt hurt by contra videos even if I wasn't hurt by them personally. And I can't not wonder if having those sly digs at trans people without contextualising the overwhelming support she has from trans people adds fuel to the flames of the flame wars against trans people. Trans people who want to have their experience heard without people acting like they are attempting regicide toward the Bread Queen."
"Not sure if this is the intention, but this video seems very personal compared to videos that are already super personal. Natalie, you probably won't read this, but make videos whenever you want and about whatever topic you want."

"15:00 what about competing with other women and being so obsessed with appearance and BEAUTY, due to wearing makeup all their life, they feel compelled to wear on the off chance so handsome man comes strutting by. It's anxiety probably with diagnosed body dysmorphic disorder. I had it and even the woman treating me at the time had it albeit to a far smaller extent. I could have timestamped more and retorted a lot of what you say Contra but you probably won't read this anyway so that will do.   You need to spend lest time in your left-wing hang outs because I believe they sour your worldview. Beauty standards aren't transphobic, fatphobic or (insert insecurity here in place of an argument)phobic. Beauty is rooted in nature and nature has it's beauty standards. Can beauty be moulded by society from this based model? Sure. But no matter how warped and twisted these standards may become, the absolute will always be there and biology isn't discriminatory in any way. It just does as designed.     If you want some real advice Contra try taking say five grams of psilocybin mushroom. Even if you don't trip it will have a positive effect on your mental health and alleviate your depression. Studies and my own experience are what lead me to believing this. In addition to this meditation for say thirty minutes at a time or ten minutes at first I reckon will help. Help you relax, clear your thoughts from distraction and think on what's important.   If you wonder why I want to help you despite disagreeing with you so much it's because I pity you and your loved ones."

I grapple with expectations to look rugged or underkempt and my own desires for clear skin and nice hair, even though I know my feelings about skin, in particular, can be unrealistic and a major cause of stress in my life."
"omg i love you so much"
"Did you just... end your video with Minecraft music?"
"New video!!!!!! Boom!"
"I really love you"
"Natalie... I promise you... you're gorgeous. You're so beautiful. It's insane. I'm head over heels. Seriously. I'm not just saying that. None of us are just saying that. Holy fucking hell.     But I'm the exact same way, so I can't blame you. Everyone in the world could tell me I'm beautiful and I'd still look in the mirror and be like, 'Okay, but... am I, though? But... am... I... though...?' It's really strange. I don't know how to change the way my brain thinks of myself. It seems impossible."
"oh this SOPHIE promo... absolutely"
"When I was a little boy I was very shy and unsecure, so I feel very ugly.  People tell me that I was smart, so I became one of that snob beauty-haters (but it was a big lie, because I always fall in love with beautifull girls lol). After years of a great journey to self acceptance and tolerance I'm not that stupid now, and recognize that a want to feel pretty and that dont make me shallow. Just wanna be happy and accepted like every human being, and that's totally natural. Thanks for your videos, you are smart and beautiful, so approved the form and content test. Sos genial!"
"Gigi seems to use bronzer and has bleach blonde hair, and has gone for the teeth-whitening and stuff - it's the hyper-real Baywatch look. As you confessed, there are moments in your life where you feel beautiful, so it's not a pathological aversion or anything.   It's personal 'flaws' you are focussing on, and I think it's operating like depression. You know like how depression creates a network that fast-tracks any kind of mild sadness into a full of meltdown. The first thing they say is if you find yourself asking, 'Why do I feel sad?' - then you should immediately ignore trying to solve the problem and get distracted by something else instead - because once you start trying to solve why you feel unhappy, you'll find a million things from your memories to fill that question.  So instead of looking for flaws, try to create new points of interest. Hair seems to be something that fucks with people a lot. Especially bald people. So it's probably worth experimenting with. : )"
"YAS! You looked great before and you look great now! 😘"
"Hubris"
"Well, be beautiful if that's what you wish for 😊"
"1. You look amazing 😍 2. I fucking DIED LAUGHING at your skin care tutorial"
"Quality people get so much love that their look, whatever it is, defines what beauty is"
"This video really hit home for me. I actually started crying a bit. Thank you."
"This ASMR moment brought to you by Natalie Wynn and her biological sequences."
"That intro was everything."
"I wore a lot of makeup for the first few months of my transition until I figured out that I pass way better without it and I save half an hour. Honestly, part of it is that I've ended up more butch since I feel like that's how I look decent.  I save a bunch of time and get gendered correctly or have people aggressively avoid gendering me at all."
"I'm a grad student, and even I want to be beautiful. 😭😫   🙌🙏Bless up🙏🙌"
"yang gang"
"On a more serious note, this is really good. I've never been able to put to words why I'm so harsh on and depressed about my own appearance while being able to tell everyone I know how they look   *fine*  and shouldn't worry about bullshit beauty standards. This is a good exploration of that feeling. Thanks for it."
"not expecting us gamers to get our national anthem at the end but i declare it to be wicked"
"Love you 😍"
"I am somewhat transphobic but I do find myself becoming more comfortable with exposure to your videos. I do think your appearance plays a role in easing me into it, but I do count myself amoung your fans."
"*Cunty*"
"Women in academia don't care about beauty because they want to appear masculine or have a weird 'not like other girls' flex? Umm. Speaking for myself, academia has been a liberating and challenging space that's pushed me towards a healthy indifference to the finer points of my physical appearance. Yes of course you still want to look good, but I credit what I study for an expansive notion of what looking good means. We're not ugly girls secretly pining to look pretty -- believe it or not, many of us are genuinely satisfied with the way we look and have more consequential things to worry about."
"this video, this subject, your story, your mind   it's so complex... my mind is still trying to process all of it, even though I can understand it completely...    I guess it means you did a really great video   it's so personal and profound and thought provoking. I'm amazed   thank you for this   wish you the best"
"You look gorgeous. Love the eyes . Your hair, as always, perfect. Simple, tasteful, carefree elegance. The sequins work on you.  I'm not into the nails anymore . I honestly could see a natural tip french manicure on you, with rhinestone daisies or something a little  more country club."
"10:56 hi yes i would like a 10 hr loop of this ASMR pls thank"
"Age will ease the burden of beauty standards."
"YouTube unsubbed me from your channel I found out about this video from your Instagram"
"You look like Celine Dion's relative"
"*slowly being lowered into a vat of acid* It's fine.  This is fine. I'm fine. I'm *fine.* This is fine.  It's fine.  I'm fine. This is fine. We're fine. I'm fine. This is fine. It's fine. I'm fine. It's fine. This is fine. It fiiaaaaaaaaaahgggghhghg....."
"As an aspiring Chad, I can say with confidence, on a scale of 1-10 you're a Rebecca."

"using SOPHIE as if i didn’t want to marry you ALREADY"
"'Through the power of original style you can create the taste by which your unique beauty can be appreciated.'  Well sure, but aren't we losing sight of the truly important question? Why haven't you mentioned the mouthfeel? Who cares about all this fleeting beauty? If your forehead doesn't have improved mouthfeel, I don't know why we should even care.    Jokes aside, I always thought you passed as pretty. It's hard for me to pick up on the differences, even in that side by side, so if you goal was to gently nudge your appearance I'd say you were successful. I don't know if 'better' implies money well spent or just comes off as a dig on your past so I'll leave it at this:  You look great, you used to look great, and I love the content and aesthetic of your videos."
"You look beautiful! I missed you and love your videos they really expand my understanding of the trans experience and i appreciate all the research you do"
"Contra, joking: 'Choke me mommy' Me: *laughs self-consciously*"
"Contra, joking: 'Choke me mommy' Me: *laughs self-consciously*"
"I am sensitive to make up or anything on my face. Lotion is even too much for me and I would end up with watery eyes and a runny noise. I wear make up maybe 2-3 times a year and even then it is very limited. I hide behind my glasses for the rest of the year. Thank you for sharing your story and helping change the idea of beauty. Its very hard to find oneself beautiful when you are comparing yourself to everyone who dont even look like themselves."
"'If all the men in the world died tomorrow, F,' can you say icon?"
"meh still ugly. but good video"
"Love you !!!!!!"
"Fantastic deep dive as always~ ......…i do want that makeup tutorial though  ❤️❤️👉👁"
"I just wanted to say that seeing you present yourself with such style on a public platform was a huge push for me to start wearing lolita fashion, and that, as a nb lesbian, wearing lolita has given me so much confidence that I didn’t even think was possible. It’s taught me to only care about how I feel I look, and not to care how I’m supposed to look. Thank you for being that inspiration for me."
"If you hadn't said that you'd gotten the surgery I wouldn't have known you really do look great I also have the mentality of a five-year-old where someone looks gross I'll call them gross"
"Looking beautiful Natalie 😍"
"the intro is too much to watch when drunk lol"
"Thanks as always for everything you do!  Fantastic video"
"Constantly impressed by how online Natalie is without descending to lazy jokes or memes. Also genuinely loved the ASMR bit as someone who uses those videos to deal with anxiety and insomnia. She should guest on a prominent asmr channel or something, that'd rule."
"This video has triggered a dysphoric spiral that I can't pull out of  Help"
"Nice to hear a SOPHIE song on a Contrapoints vid! 2 trans icons"
"Yeah, the same thing has been going through my head for the last few weeks, too. Thanks, Ryan Reynolds!"
"Honestly you look incredible, and what's important is you did this for yourself. I'm glad you did it, if it makes you feel better about yourself physically."
"*B U R G E O N I N G*"
"That Zoe Blade Erik Satie fusion was excellent! Great video, too, Natalie!"
"I’m obsessed with my skin and recently got my hair straightened. I feel like I need to get milia removed from my skin and that the world will end(only when I look in the mirror). It reminds of when I was anorexic, getting obsessed and controlling over it.  My eyes go straight to the the flaws as well.  I also want facial feminization and I was born a woman.  I work out and find out what my body is able to do, study to see what my mind can do, what I can achieve through finding out about myself, and handle with grace.  That’s what makes me feel beautiful  When I focus on these things, I don’t waste my money on a new beauty products(because I have my research pretty set on what works for my skin and what doesn’t as well🤣)."
"women drell and makeup because they 'internalized' the sexual competition. What started as just simply maximizing the quality of partners became a value system in itself. Just like guys competing for money , muscle & power way beyond the amount of pussy rewards.  You value scale should always be rooted in practicality.  .....aand please dont cut your balls"
"She's back, OMG, love you mommy!"
"Yeah I feel like Im fully capable of appreciating non-normative forms of beauty if its in other people but not in myself"
"'I was hoping that surgery would completely change my self-image and make me like myself' I've only known you since your last post and I fell in love with you around that time. You became what's attractive to me instead of me trying to fit a preconceived image around someone. I wish we had that attitude about our own selves.  And of course Beethoven 7-2 is the best pick ever."
"You're so brave! I'm too scared to have surgery to fix my underbite, been trying to talk myself into it for over a decade. Props to you for going through all the pain and fear, you look great."
"I swear I always catch a Sousa march on this channel's videos"
"I'm surprised you didn't mentioned the incel 'smash bone' crowd. They're a real hoot."
"Girl got money now"
"I, for one, love gymnopedies 1, etc,"
"where to cop sequin top?"
"Isn't espousing the belief that being honest about your physical appearance is masculine REALLY misogynistic?"
"Don’t worry, you are beautiful."
"i find cellulite attractive, but i'm a dyke, het guys may differ?"
"I always found it strange that pretty people are ascribed to be more moral, kind, and whatever, whereas due to my life experiences with pretty people, I've attributed them to being generally shittier people and I have to make a conscious effort to rein that in to give them the benefit of the doubt."
"You are beautiful."
"I’m a simple cat.  I see Contrapoints, I listen to it loudly at work"
"I hope you'll one day consider doing a piece on carnism and veganism. I believe carnism is a form of racism (speciesism) and is definitely overlooked in our society. Even if you don't buy into it, it is still a highly intriguing topic upon which must needs be remarked."
"I'm new enough to not be foaming at the mouth, so genuinely you definitely look more fem."
"Wow we stan a SOPHIE stan 😍"
"29:26 LILLY WATCHOWSKI is a patron? Like, THE Lilly Watchowski?! Edit: I misspelled Wachowski"

"No one should ever conflate artistic ability with intelligence. Anyone that describes a great painter as a 'genius' for being a skilled painter and nothing else is a dumbass."
"The editing quality of your videos just keep getting better and better with every upload. Love this and you 💗"
"It's ok to want to be beautiful. I also agree that's probably more of a psychological thing, and probably harmful in the long run. I don't think everyone obsess about beauty, to be honest, but I think many more people obsess over it nowadays. I think it's specially true for you for obvious reasons (the video editing, you being trans). You are beautiful, but it doesn't matter what anyone says.  Also, it's very different to know something rationally and to truly internalize it. I think it's like that with almost every psychological problem. I know it's totally dumb to be afraid of having phone calls, but I'm still am, and feeling guilty about it just makes it worse. I think it works in a similar way with the beauty obsession. You know rationally it's not a great thing to obsess about, but knowing it rationally doesn't change much. I think only some kind of internal paradigm change, maybe a gradual one, can help with that. I also know 'internal paradigm change' is too vague, but I'm thinking about the kind of changes promoted by cognitive behavioral types of therapies that tries to 'drive home' some things we know rationally."
"There are many video essays on YouTube that I throw on to entertain me. When I want to think critically and have my worldview altered, I watch ContraPoints. I wasn't very in touch with the transgender movement until I watched these videos. They are foundational and essential."
"Had a Ben Shapiro ad on this video lolol"
"You're gorgeous. Yeah, yeah, I know, 'you're a fan you don't count' - I've been *watching* you find yourself, and you've _become_ prettier than you used to be"
"i SCREAMED when i heard faceshopping omg taste..."
"Omg 16:20"
"“I have no style” -said while wearing the most beautiful glitter jacket I’ve literally ever seen In seriousness though, as someone who used to be that “Becky” who hated the very concept of makeup, it really hit home when you said how beauty is a symbol of life and youth. Looking back, it’s strange how I demonized the concept of beauty as some bad capitalist thing, and I now see it as this ancient force"
"Instant up"
"you do an amazing work! love from Brazil 💜"
"Lady, are you even able to break even with this crazy production quality."
"Omg Sophiiiieeeeee!!!!"
"Yeah, I feel pretty feral sometimes too. I get it. I love when you had that Death Becomes Her moment, love it. *sigh* I do it too."
"...did anybody else suddenly need stare at their _own_ face in the mirror at some point during this video?  Just me?  Okay. I'm also not sure if I should be passing judgement at all on a video about elaborate, planned beauty when I'm such a don't-care schlubby tomboy, but then I get distracted looking down at my beautiful, metallic, FLAMING pink new nail polish.  shiiiinnnnyyy...  I guess what I'm saying is that there's nothing wrong with caring about beauty.  If that's what makes a person feel better, feel...more their true self, (and it doesn't hurt anyone), then go for it!   Wait, that sounded way more flip than I intended to...what I mean is, regardless of where the standards come from, makeup and related subjects are about playing around with image and being creative, figuring out fun (and beautiful!) new ways to express yourself.  You know how they call people who professionally put makeup on actors, makeup ARTISTS?  Well...yeah.  It can still be art if you're doing it _un_professionally, and on just yourself.  As for the 'schlubby tomboy with SHIIINNNNYYYY metallic pink fingernails' thing?  I guess my point there is that not every part of a person fits into the same stereotype.  My body's style is lazy, comfy...not deliberately trying to look more like a man, but more....just not giving a fuck about pouring on extra feminine, and I care way more about comfort than whether or not society, men, whatever find me acceptable.  My hair's style is usually 'get out of my face', and my glasses style is somewhat cutesy hipster. But my NAILS are drag-queen as FUCK.  Well, maybe not drag queen, they're not long enough.  _Glam_ as fuck, that'll have to do.  Loose comfy superhero t-shirt, jeans...GLITTERY RAINBOWS ON MY FINGERS.  That's me.   My point is caring about beauty isn't anything to be ashamed of, especially when in a trans-woman's case, it's also about _not_ setting off 'Hmmm, something is off here...' bells in people's minds as you try to casually go about your business.  And there's nothing wrong with it because it doesn't hurt anybody.  Anyway.  Do whatever the fuck style you want, again, as long as it's not hurting anybody, and even do a _mix_ of styles, or wear one thing one day and an entirely different _genre_ of look the next!  And don't let anybody shame you for your concerns.  Your concerns are _yours_ , not theirs.  And considering how society views, treats people and flips out over beauty...it's a perfectly legit thing to be worried about."

"Starfish Nights."
"Wait! You didn't ask me what I think about make up and I'm a str-... Oh..."
"going off what DR J peterson said that you referred to. Could your desire to be beautiful come from evolution where beautiful women = good genes and fertility and sex and babies which could then mean that your desire to be beautiful is in fact for sex. Evolution favors beautiful women so being a beautiful woman would be favorable. Perhaps that desire is uhhh evolution driven."
"the privilege is astounding"
"Totally feel you. Showering has even gotten hard, because then I have to be RIGHT UP CLOSE with the flesh bags hanging on my chest. And I wonder if top surgery will actually make me feel better, or...I dunno. Anywho, this random youtuber does find you beautiful."
"What’s that painting?"
"You look gorgeous!"
"I hear you about wtf is with aging necks? As someone who turned 40 years old this year - let's just say you no longer need to get your morbid kicks of curiousity from looking at footage of industrial accidents anymore, as you can just divert your eyes below the line of your chin when you look in the mirror (or just have a 'feel' - if you are really daring). Otherwise, I basically look 12. So, Ben Shapiro's transphobic argument of saying to a college student 'why are you 22 and not 60?' is defeated by my own body."
"We stan sophie"
"Who said cellulite and flabby arms aren't attractive? Because they were wrong."
"Hope ur feeling better after a rough month. We love you Contra ❤️"

"I love you and you're amazing but you didn't characterize evo-psych theory fairly. You did outline the limits of critical theory pretty well though. Be well!"
"I honestly cannot tell you if you're pretty, and I'll be one of a thousand comments lost, but fyi, I started watching your videos because you were featured in a Lindsay Ellis video.  Before I watched your videos and listened to you talk about being trans, I thought you were a woman.  So idk if it makes you feel better, but you are definitely passing."
"I recently began creating/designing press on nails & my real life dream is to see you wearing some claws I made"
"secretly loving women while quietly dying inside is the wlw way, congratulations"
"I’m a simple man.  I see that Natalie posts... and I click"
"I actually feel like I really needed this video. I'm a woman in academia, trying to get my PhD to become a political philosopher and/or professor-- I definitely have developed an anti-beauty complex and it's been interesting and at points, kind of toxic. I used to be really into makeup and image (just very vain in general) and I can't seem to always disconnect makeup from those feelings. I've always found myself asking why anyone should care about beauty. Not only this, but so many makeup products are made so unsustainably and through exploitative labor (which lots of things are, but it seems like there's not many ethical options for beauty products as of yet). As someone who adheres quite a bit to communalism, it's just been very hard for me to completely grasp makeup/beauty now when so many things contribute to several exploitative/dominating systems. I've been pushing myself to be more open-minded, however."
"SISTERCEL !! ... That's my word ! Who ever heard of a fag that doesn't have sex ... Do I still qualify as homosexual ?  But now i have a word to describe me ! SISTERCEL !!"
"Still looks like a dude"
"I'm really happy it came out so well for you, and I'm glad you got some time to yourself while you dealt with it all. As usual your latest video has scrambled my brain and made me question everything. You have a weird way of addressing my thoughts just as I'm having them."
"kind of weird how the women you know in academia aren't that feminine. I'm a bio major and most of the women in my class are super feminine. As for my female professors, the only ones who don't wear make-up are the the ones over 65."
"You're such a parody of mtf trans thing. Love/ hate it. Talent and great sense of humor. You are soooo close to being a CIS woman...like u are a hysterical one. Now just drop the WeHo accent. U pass more than Trump, Melania and Michael Obama."

"You could probably run a pretty dope amsr channel with very little to do with fascism.  If you wear a mask, I'll keep your secret."
"Also, I want to note that (at least as a student) one of the reasons I'm more GNC in academic spaces than in other spaces (would never wear press on nails except for halloween, etc &soforth) is that it's one of the only places/jobs I can be gnc. Everywhere else I actually have to be *more* feminine to be taken seriously--implied office dresscodes of makeup, on-trend form-fitting women's clothing, and heels--so its nice to be able to cut loose and do something ~daring~ like cut my hair above the neck or wear men's clothing"
"Great day! Last finals done. Get home and new Contra waiting! Some days I actually enjoy life!"

"Come thru SOPHIE"
"your quirky and cute personality matches your quick wit and it harmonizes flawlessly with your big beautiful eyes, and the fun way you hold yourself and move as you talk. you are undeniably womanly and beautiful! when i have poor opinions i just think them to myself quietly but when i give a compliment it is a true thought!"
"So glad you're back! I discovered your channel and blew through all of your content right before you took your break, and have been looking forward to hearing more of your thoughts on all things. I have been out of school for a couple years and while I have some very smart friends I didn't realize how desperately I was missing this level thoughtful discussion until I found you. Thank you for your videos. (Also, you look great)"
"Pre-FFS, I always thought Natalie looked a bit like Judy Greer, and now I’m fairly sure I would mistake her for Judy Greer if I saw her on the street"
"ty for still making a video for us while you're healing!!"
"Oh my god you look absolutely beautiful!"
"Ah futility, mí amor. Just keep pushing that boulder people, keep on pushing."
"I love you. Thank you for the video, Natalie."

"Hmm... I Never had a problem with my brow ridge till I watched this video.... Guess I'll go to the Liquor store (cuz its cheaper than FFS)"
"Beauty fades, fashion fades, but style is eternal"
"Forgive my presumption, but I think you could benefit from some self-love. You will be happy and satisfied with your looks when you stop getting validation from others. Dopamine shots (pleasure) /= happiness. May I recommend Breeny Lee's channel? You should check out her vids on self-love and makeup in particular. She's a instagram influencer/life coach."
"I could not take my eyes off yours. That makeup is entrancing."
"Ahhhh you're stunning! I'm so freaking jealous!"
"'The skull lady' I am deceased ☠☠☠   I haven't seen the rest of the video yet I just thought that was funny"
"Couldn't you write off your FFS on your taxes as a business expense the way Gus Johnson did with his keytar because you made this video about it?"
"Actually really digging the ASMR..."
"I really liked your point on style, as someone who's not that conventionally attractive I focus a lot on the things I can control to feel good. But I also think it's important to note that what people view as 'stylish' is often affected by our standards of beauty, especially when it comes to size. Society sees thin people as stylish when they're just wearing ugly light-wash jeans and beatles shirt from target, but if a fat person were wearing the same thing they'd be looked over."
"NATALIE N SOPHIE IN ONE VIDEO??!!?!??!? IS THIS REAL?!?!?!!"
"oh shit, i have body dysmorphia, i'll be back later"
"My pores decided to look 37 this year and my heart goes out to you, sister. 🙏🏻"
"choke me mommy"
"You are gorgeous !"
"HOLY SHIT! You edit your own videos? Your production is fucking incredible. I needed to get that out of the way because I have some idea how hard what you do is and dammit your work is incredible.   Even more impressive though is the way you make me think about myself, other people, the kind of person I want to be and the kind of world I want to live in. I appreciate you so much you brave, beautiful badass."
"SOPHIE!!!!!!!!"
"9:13 lol"
"You're so amazing - your humor is always on point, and you always look so awesome! You really inspire me. Keep doing you, ma'am!!"
"oh shit! Mfing sophie in the intro!"
"Hey contrapoints are you going to make a video about trans athletes playing against non trans women? Seems right up your alley"
"YAS!!! Sophie being in the intro was everything 🥰"
"Just in case you guys are wondering the song in the beginning is Faceshopping by Sophie"
"I want to just say that It makes me a bit sad to think that maybe Natalie feels perhaps at times that her efficacy as a voice for honest compassionate and respectful discussion of Trans and left issues is Influenced by her ability to maintain a standard of beauty or unique style.   I was personally introduced to the channel way back during the peak dysphoria time of 'why i quit academia' and it was never style or beauty that kept me watching. I don't want to get all disengenously 'Inner Beauty' here but the thing that maintained interest genuinely WAS that Natalie was informed, articulate and, very importantly, funny.     In fact In someways the fact that Natalie at that time looked rather (and I'll try and be kind here) 'awkward' did a lot to FORCE me as a Cis guy to confront the fact that Trans people deserve the simple respect of acknowledging thier identity and humanity wether or not they pass. I don't really know the point I'm trying to make here tbh, but I think it's at least a good Idea to reflect on the possibility that many of us might not have been drawn to the channel if Contra had always been beautiful.     I dunno, just thinking out loud. Emdure Tully speech over."
"*sighs* Reminds me of how underwhelming GRS and my own FFS were. Still gonna keep getting them surgeries tho."
"I'm glad you didn't share the whole journey with us, because just the little bit of it you discussed in this video caused me piles and piles of sympathetic anxiety."
"13:28 '[...] lesbians are straight [...]' - contrapoints"
"Façam a legenda em português rápido!"
"I really love the effort you put into these videos. It's top tier content. I hope you feel better ❤️ and put your mental health above the channel. Much love"
"love that intro! Faceshopping is such a perfect choice"
"26:36 I really wish I could share your hope. But humans are pathetically tribal, and judgmental creatures. I don't know we managed to survive this long."
"Thanks for this channel.  I’m only a recent subscriber, but I have learned much from you in just a little time.  I was concerned you weren’t posting for so long, and I’m happy to see you back.  And, you look gorgeous.   I honestly thought you did before, and if enough of us tell you so, maybe you’ll believe us.  I presume you’re pursuing an ideal which you’ll never quite attain, but take some time to enjoy where you are.   Do you know you’re not getting “clocked” anymore these days?  You get recognized as a well known trans woman.  You’re solutions is to be anonymous again —— but don’t do that, you’d be greatly missed.   As an old hetero man, I can’t really know what you’ve been through.  But I can relate, a little.  I was saddled with a serious facial defect — for half my life — which could have made me a permanent incel.   I am honestly terrified of how bad it nearly went.   My eventual surgery wasn’t perfect, but I decided to like my new face, so I do.  And, I met the right partner.    Now I get to pretend to offer sage advice (did I mention I’m old?).   Please take care of yourself — whatever that means for you.  You are needed."
"I actually do like how women look without makeup and I don't dislike how they look with it either.  Whenever I'm with someone I just love how they look after a shower, with nothing on (as opposed to incels judging strangers with discrete makeup). The human body is just so beautiful: the scattering if light on the skin, the natural rosing of the capillaries, the random distribution and uniform density of hairs, pigmentation, everything you would conceal. Not even the discoloration under the eyes (which everyone has some) or other 'defects' detracted from my finding everything so beautiful. I used to get lost studying the features of my partners while they read or we watched TV at night.  With my longest term girlfriend, she loved wearing makeup and styling her hair, and wearing beautiful clothes. The thing is I would encourage her, because it's her body, not an object for my pleasure, and she did look beautiful having fun with it. She did it for herself and for the image she wanted projected to the world, not for my benefit, and that's cool. There were plenty of times for me to admire my preferred look, so I could also enjoy hers.  We do exist, those who like the 'natural look' without the naturalistic fallacy or the veiled slut shaming, as mere preference, though I find we're not that common."
"I’m sorry I can’t hear you over the awesomeness of those sequins"
"You look stunning! (You did before,  and you 'passed' then as well) I can see a difference though, and I hope you are happy about the way you look now. All the best. ETA: I wouldn't describe you as pretty; you're more than that. You are strikingly good-looking with strong features. Someone who is pretty has pleasing but insignificant features, not a show-stopper but rather just another face in the crowd, easily overlooked. That could never be you."
"Get out of my head. I am inflicting electrolysis on myself currently and wishing I could do laser. Although we have very similar hair color so maybe I can after all"
"Ain't it funny how we often disparage what we truly desire.  On the surface most folks have nothing but shit to say about beauty but damn do we all want it.  Also props for mentioning the statistics around conventional beauty about folks like that being perceived differently."
"Holy shit, post-transition Contra in a well-lit room."
"That surgery was subtle, but it made a lot of difference. Nice!"
"As much as I want to add something intelligent to this discussion, I need to know where that sequinned blouse came from."
"8:42 also, I just wanna say thank you for making this video. I can’t quite put it into words, but I probably needed to watch this."
"Damn , too bad you don’t live in the LA area, I wouldn’t show you an amazing time."
"I hear Sophie playing, I like"
"I think Black Mirror might also be a reference to a black mirror used to conjure demons in a European tradition"
"8:42 you are very beautiful"
"'dO yOu wAnT yOuR fAcE tO bE uNtOnEd???'"
"'Maybe she's born with it, maybe a surgeon peeled her face off and fixed her sh!tty skull'"
"Holy cow if you made an ASMR channel I'd die happy"
"What do you do for the massive shoulder-hip ratio do you just like, live with it like so many uh, congenitally-female slavic women?"
"you  look hot before & after shit you didn't need any cutting on  your face"
"i love that u said cellulite is fish i screamed"
"You look great, no joke. Far better then I'll ever be."
"Her videos are always quite surreal"
"Hey Contra... I'm not a big fan but I do think you're pretty. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"Queen congrats on 600k! <3 <3"
"You are an inspiration! I recently came out as trans to pretty much everyone I know and I love your videos! They are so helpful and I just wish I had a better way to show my appreciation (I’m broke 😭"
"In all sincerity — you’re beautiful"
"im nearly in tears like i relate so hard. i honestly only do femininity and wear makeup cuz i want to get hired lmao"
"Gay or gaymer?  Yes."
"Holy shit that intro fucked me up <3"
"What's that painting with the woman and the skull called/who is it by?"
"4:53 you’ve passed since I’ve been following you, and that was before surgery"
"You are so entertaining 😄 I never know what over-the-top visuals I'm going to be presented with on this channel. Anyway, I hope you are happy with how everything turned out. Sounds harrowing."
"Tbh you are a 7.5/10"
"9:10-9:31 is a personal attack."
"Perfect timing!  Recently I've made the connection between style and self-image. I hated myself a lot when I younger, and I didn't put effort into my appearance. It was easier to deflect my thoughts from 'I hate who I am as a human being' to 'I look disgusting.'  Now I've been healing my deeper issues, and I've been thinking about my personal style and aesthetics more. I always heard 'I dress up for myself' and rolled my eyes. But I get it now. Looking stylish is like a little gift to myself. I don't NEED to put in the extra time, but that extra time spent on myself is a small way of me caring for myself.  I want to present myself in a way that makes me happy. And it makes me happy to represent my personality through my a e s t h t i c.  I was thinking about making a video about self-image to flesh my thoughts out a bit more. I really liked listening to your perspective, CP! Thanks for sharing :-)"
"Every video is like a mini documentary and a piece of ARRRRTTTTTTTTTTTT UGH it’s my favorite"
"This video is so good!! Also, I’m a fan of Sophie and the fact that you used her music is really rad!!!!!!!"
"Ladies, bone destroyers are we"
">What every gamer thinks about makeup Okay, I've lost it now lmfao"
"holy shit the difference is amazing. good for you! I'm about to get surgery to remove my tardytots"
"1 like = 1 rush of dopamine"
"I notice I seem to remember people I like at their most beautiful and dislike at their most ugly. I feel like this should make me feel cute, but it doesn't. Do I dislike myself?"
"Knowing how you should feel about something is a whole different thing to actually feeling that way.   I hope the surgery has helped eased your dysphoria even if you are still having these thoughts. Baby steps are better than no steps."
"when you showed the comparison photos i teared up :')"
"Which song was the credits music, it sounded familiar?"
"Glad I'm not the only one who has no idea what I look like. It's reassuring that you're attractive and feel the same way."
"opening this with faceshopping.... the behavior you exhibited was iconic. the legend jumped out"
"Stopped doing whatever I was doing to watch this!!!"
"damn i am a lesbian thats straight (gay) chillin"
"Cheers Lady!  I find you Quite-Fetch!  Inner complexity, outer originality,  ^______^  You got it."
"looks amazing QUEEN"
"but that japanese yeast is SO worth the price point jus saying"
"I did my 26 years as a cis woman not wanting to be pretty. Discovered eyeshadow and sparkles and now I wanna do lots of make up. Being pretty is part of human need it seems lol. Love you Natalie <3"
"This made me feel more high than I already am."
"I had this moment of passing sadness when I started this video. I thought: who is this prettified version of Celine Dion? Where is Natalie?  So yes: you do look pretty.  Take care and kind regards! And thank you for this video, which is beautiful as your videos always are!"
"I love you so damn much. This is the most relatable and honest explanation I’ve seen on this subject. That means so much to your fans, TRUST.   You are beautiful, and so was the amazing way this video made me laugh, think and cry a little too."
"This made me go beat my face"
"“It’s hard being a six.” WOW MY LIFE IN ONE SENTENCE."
"fuck yeah SOPHIE"
"just me or is that jailhouse make up tutorial video was made by a lady from the reality show love after lock up? aha she lowkey crazy"
"'I AM VAN GOCHH' HAHAHAHA BITCH ILY"
"25:41 as a history student that is labelled as 'conservative' and 'eurocentric' for loving European medieval and folk music while also being leftist in Latin America... yeah, I know that feeling."
"Haha at 13:00 I was thinking, 'Well, not everyone,' then she said maybe lesbians are just straight chilling and I was like ok good job"
"In the middle of a battle against compulsive skin-picking and body dysmorphia, this video was a godsend. I won't lie and say it changed the way I feel or see myself at all, but it's a relief to know that there are successful and brilliant people with the same ongoing struggles as me. Thanks, Natalie <3"
"This hit home for me. Thank you. Really :-)"
"oh shit we really do live in a society dont we"
"You really are beautiful though"
"Yaasss queeen"
"Beautiful. I'm so happy to have been with you for this journey so far. Thank you for sharing this part of yourself with us.  Video is fucking great btw."
"'America needs a ContraPoints right now...' No, ma'am, the world needs a ContraPoints.  🇨🇦"
"'Honestly if all men died tomorrow, F..'  Im crying lmfaooo"
"I love these thought provoking videos that you make and I think all the ones you have made up to this point have done a lot to turn the tide of the alt-right mentality. Don't ever think you NEED to be anything other than what you want. I hope you continue to make content like this, but if you want to do other things, please do those things. You rep the trans community well, but be cognizant of your limits and know that a lot of us are really grateful to you and just want to see you be happy and successful. If you ever decide to lay down your sword, we will still love you. Thank you, Natalie."
"If you dyed your hair dark brown, you’d look like a young Winona Ryder.  Ps, your videos are awesome!"
"SOGOOD"
"Before those sprays and stuff, you actually looked really good, not to dis your hair, but it matches it well, brings your look together, I wish we loved in a society where you could go out like that without fear of someone bringing memories or whatever flooding in of..... Traumatizing you and such, and that you could be yourself and natural, because that's a beautiful look, I personally think its better than with all the makeup, but if you want to wear that its up to you, your beauty is your beauty, not anyone else's"
"Honestly: If “pretty” means doll-like and socially feminine looks, you’re kind of pretty without makeup. Slightly more without a bit of makeup. Kind of scary but interesting with heaps/drag style makeup. But being attractive is more important than being pretty and to many, you’re very very attractive for a number of reasons. You shouldn’t care so much about being pretty. No one should. It’s just so very pointless and maddening."
"'Once you get into a serious skincare collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.' The only thing that really worries me is the snail cream. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a beauty blogger in the depths of a snail binge.   edit: Ok, joking aside. Why did this video feel like it was heading towards Aristotelian virtue ethics by way of Gigi Gorgeous but then swerved towards Nietzsche at the end? Is the 'will to power' fantasy nature of social media success getting to Natalie?"
"Just @ all the high femme bisexuals next time ✨😛"
"Well, I just cancelled my plans for the next *checks video* 30 minutes and 51 seconds"
"You are so important, I'm so glad you're back :')"
"Nice Thompson shout out."
"I'd do you aggressively."
"ya she really really looks like a pretty woman"
"Natalie has talked about a lot of things on this channel, but for some reason this particular topic unsettled me the most. I'm not really one to consider outer beauty, and the idea that people place this much value on it, for one reason or another, is really messing with me."
"You were a good looking dude and now you're a good looking broad. There ain't no debate."
"You could sell me a self help book series, please do an edition on decluttering"
"You are a beauty ♡"
"Your nose looks like Scarlett Johansson's, it's cute!"
"the eyebrow raise with the 'a camgirl' statement....  oh, the unintentional shade lol"
"19:35 wow great minds think alike 😍"
"Seeing you in the makeup mirror talking about feeling pretty I was so hoping we would get a Louise from Gypsy “I’m a pretty girl Mama” moment!"
"25:16 *loads rifle with hollow-point pitchforks*"
"Wasn't expecting to hear about Mozart's bussy but here we are."
"she looks like a different person woah"
"If I'd never heard of you, I think it'd be about 50/50 whether I'd notice, before.  Almost certainly less likely now."
"Oh god, there's just too much to say about what is so great about this video!"
"You look GREAT...absolutely lovely❤"
"Now you made me wonder how tall you are 🤔"
"You were pretty before, you’re pretty now!!! Looks great!!"
"Mama you look beautiful!"
"that cutaway, of you doing the silence of the lambs bit: yeah, you don't just pass, you're hot."
"B U R G E O N I N G"
"We do indeed stan the queen of intros."
"100% applaud talking about something so personal and vulnerable and opening yourself up to the hordes."
"Hey, if my autistic ass could acclimate to Blaire White's FFS, I can handle this. Hell, it should take me half as long, since you went for the 'normal pretty woman' look and not the 'Malibu Barbie' look. I mean, to each her own, but one is a tad more Uncanny Valley than the other, y'know? I just don't adjust to change too easily.   I know it's cliche to say, but you were always gorgeous and feminine to me. I'm just glad that you match your own personal aesthetics now. I'd like that for myself one day (if only they'd stop making junk food so goddamn cheap and delicious and find a cure for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, I'd be all fucking set).   No matter what, you're always Mama Contra to me, and I'll always adore you.   Just remember keep on top of that pain/swelling. As someone with TMJ who recently had to have a rotten molar pulled, I know jaw pain is like, easily one of the most aggravating and inconvenient pains ever (knees being a close second and back being a not-so-distance third). Remember the rule, 'Get ahead of the pain,' and don't hesitate to speak to a doctor if you feel like your post-op symptoms have been hanging on for longer than normal. We can't have our favourite YouTube Mom getting horribly ill on us, now, can we? Health first! Always!   Cheers, beautiful! We're all happy for you. <3"
"Thank u for your wit, thoroughness, and sense of humor!! I always look forward to your videos. keep being you <3"
"You legitimately always make the most stylish and well-argued videos, thank you for inspiring me <3"
"I'm just here for the ASMR"
"I don't understand how ContraPoints can think she's anything but gorgeous.    I mean I can, I'm not abysmal looking and I dive down that rabbit hole too. And I blame it more on societal expectations that men are disgusting slobs and that testosterone turns otherwise cute children into hideous monsters during puberty, rather than societal standards for female beauty.   But seeing someone else do it just makes me scream internally."
"jowles is a very femine word"
"u look gr8 sis"
"I'm assuming you've seen this, but if not I highly recommend it re: your commentary on style:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo8jwJ_2l0c"
"I don't understand your fixation on Gigi. I find her as interesting as a blank piece of paper. Her youtube channel is nothing more than a bad spin-off of the Kardashians, where she shameless flaunts her rich lifestyle to the rest of the world. ....         ok... now that i wrote and thought about it, i guess I get the appeal. But girl, as for a role model, she's got nothing on you."
"I love you 💓"
"Random anecdote about beauty buried in the comments: Keeping it vague for personal reasons.  When I grew up I was generally not considered attractive (except my mom, of course, who always said I was BOOTIFUL). That's not just low self-esteem. I had a hard time getting a girlfriend, was considered the ugliest of my group of friends once when overhearing gossip and everything lined up with that fact. I wasn't hideous, just lower than average. 4/10. Run-of-the-mill unattractive.  I travel to another country. First thing I notice - ok, not the first thing, that would be the 'welcome' sign - I noticed my sense of beauty was kinda out of whack with this new place. People looked very different from my norm and the standards that THEY used to separate themselves between 'beautiful' and 'ugly' did not always match with what I had in mind.  Not only that, but in this new country I happen to look exotic and I guess my ugly traits weren't seen that way by the people there as ugly. Suddenly, I'm on the other end of the pool. Even in a new country, I didn't turn heads. But I was definitely considered handsome now. I felt it in how people treated me and talked about me, good or bad.   The two things I learned, from being immersed in completely different environments with different standards of beauty?   1- It's completely arbitrary. Bullshit. It's like saying people with big feet are ugly and people with small feet are attractive. It's like saying people who can whistle are beautiful, and those who can't are ugly. They change from place to place, depending on what's rare and what's common, and it never really makes much sense. It's one thing to know this, intellectually. It's another to actually experience it yourself.   2- Being temporarily handsome did not improve my self-esteem that much or make life easier for me. Some things were actually weird, like getting praise for work I knew was shitty just because of my looks. I also got some jealousy my way, which wasn't fun.     Overall? I wasn't happy in either end of the spectrum. I think the middle of the road might be the best place to be, beauty wise. Being neither attractive or unattractive, passing unnoticed. Being ignored is bliss, after the nastiness I experienced on either end. (all that said though, it's a HELL of a lot easier to get a girlfriend if you're attractive. I have confirmed that. I mean, it's not empirical evidence, just my crappy life story, but that's what I experienced.)  TL;DR - beauty standards change a lot from country/group to another. I've experienced both sides of the coin thanks to that. It's weird."
"okay but the cheekbones are natural? rude."
"“I think I’d just rather think about *The Aesthetic* than *The Apocalypse* , and that’s *The Darkness* “"
"hii natalie have you seen detective pikachu is it good please let me know thanks!!! also the bone video thing was good thank you"
"“Do you want your face to be UNTONED??” made me crack up"
"Real talk women do look sick without their makeup but after a while they just look normal and most people stop caring. I think at least…"
"W-were you wearing makeup before you put on makeup? Or was that just good lighting?"
"Girl, you've been glistening 24/7 since at least 2018!    Anyway, fuck fashion, self development, style, expanding beauty standards, and aging, what we need is ammortality and eternal youth and then maybe, just maybe we can start to feel good about ourselves a couple days at a time."
"Me in seventh grade: I think I'm pretty much okay with how I look Acne: *I'm about to end this man's whole career*"
"You look lovely, Ms. Natalie <3"
"I guess I'm saying you are beautiful. I don't see just the fact that yes, you are attractive and will 'pass'. Add that to the intellectual prowess of a jaguar, you have created a new genre of beauty. Brains and hot."
"I know you talked about fan praise in your video, but my mom just like walked in while I was watching the video and goes, 'who's that she's so pretty.' That's coming from a woman who is 59 and quite right on the political spectrum. Your ending paragraph kind of scares me tbh. Like girl I worry. Also, girl your charisma earns the respect of many which is beauty that most do not have. All of your thoughts are just thoughts. They exist and are there but it doesn't mean they're true. I know you dunno who I am but love you <3."
"I wish there were more feral cats in the liquor store"
"OhmygoshpleasedoanASMR! You running your nails over a beaded or sequined gown while whispering about patriarchy would be the most fascinating way to relax ever!"
"Dayum, girl - you look GORGEOUS! 🤩"
"I think everyone tries to look beautiful to give their life meaning"
"I'm a cis black bisexual male. I got some fat ass lips. A rounded ass nose. Nappy ass dreads. But I'm beautiful. Fuck conformity. Look that motherfucker you see in the mirror and realize just how pretty you are comrades. Love Breadtube and this community and our (metaphorical b/c fuck a monarchy) Queen Natalie!"
"Natalie, your channel is probably the best influence I've stumbled upon in the past couple years. Keep being incredible."
"Next, some serious hair reimagining please"
"You are really fucking beautiful and I look to you for Beaty/fashion inspiration. You are really good at up-do’s also!"
"If your voice gets any higher than you'll be really hard to clock anymore. I tried pitching up your voice a little and you definitely have female speaking patterns."
"Hey ContraPoints.  Do you think that the more meaningful relationships a person has, the less they are likely to obsess about others' beauty approval?"
"Nat, you do what you need to do to feel happy.  There are all sorts of things we've all internalized that are bullshit.  Some of them involve gender, class, ethnicity...  You'd practically have to be a sociopath to actually cast all that social conditioning off.  Part of being human is l i v [ing]  i n   a   s o c i e t y, and so it only seems natural that you'd internalize some of those norms of that society, even if you can intellectualize that they're bullshit.  My wife really wants to have public sex (not 'not allowed near schools again' public, just 'in a room with a glass wall for consenting adults to watch' public), and while I know that a) the nearby club where we could do that is a safe space in which I'm sure we'd be welcomed and accepted, and b) she won't leave me because some guy gets a look at how gorgeous she is naked and compliments her about it, the lizard part of my brain that was trained to be self-conscious about my own physical unattractiveness and covetous of my wife like she's a spear I desperately need to be able to bring down my next mammoth makes me think some pretty shitty things about that desire.  Things I know are bullshit, but that I can't help but think and feel.  Is wanting to look pretty a thought crime?  What about wanting to enjoy something your friends enjoy that you just don't?  What about actually wanting to murder certain people who have done horrible things to children in an extrajudicial way?"
"that SOPHIE intro left me deceased"
"This is so interesting. Because I've felt that being trans and caring so much about looking like the opposite gender is only enforcing gender roles and it bums me out. I know people are tired of hearing that and I'm sorry.     But thanks for making this. I feel like you make a lot of sense and it helps me to understand your thought process.  I appreciate it."
"I love you"
"I disliked you coming into this video but started to say to myself 'she's not that--' and then you do your skincare routine without tying your hair up or wearing a god damn headband. Anyways demon, you shouldn't put highlighter on your nose like that, it exaggerates the ruggedness and largeness of it. Make it a thinner line and buff it out."
"Guys I think we can all agree Natalie looks gorgeous with or without any work, but I definitely love the new look!!"
"If that little scroll you did was any indication, you look amazing in those pics, so its pretty much understandable that you would get those kinds of responses, some may be flattery, but you are quite attractive as a woman in those pictures, and I know your joking about the number thing but I'd personally say a 8 or 9 but that may be skewed slightly, I think its reason to believe anyone would see you as a 7 or 8 so long as they like a feminine appearance"
"The queen of aesthetics saying she has no style is just objectively wrong."
"Starting the video with SOPHIE 👍"
"i feel the same way about myself. most of my life is just me wishing i felt pretty."
"Fantastic video and really came at a great time for me."
"This was such a great video, it did not seem remotely like it was 30 minutes long cause it went by so fast and I was so absorbed in it! You were beautiful before the surgery and are beautiful after the surgery. Also I love your sparkly top (dress?). Anyway, I loved hearing your perspective on beauty. As a cis woman who was never a fan of wearing makeup, I have a weird relationship with the idea of beauty. I have very rarely felt beautiful and the fact that my parents and stepmom all pushed for me to wear start wearing makeup around 14 (an idea I flat out refused because that's what teenagers do- whatever their parents don't want them to do) made me loathe makeup for a long time (it was VERY much a not good 'not like other girls' situation). And now, at 31, when I would love to be able to hide my rosacea and maybe look older than 20 so I can actually be taken seriously...most makeup makes my very sensitive eyes feel like they're burning. Oh the irony. I love the idea of focusing on style instead of beauty though because style feels more like something you can control and make your own."
"Welcome back, Natalie! Not gonna lie: missed you a bunch, and seeing you'd uploaded a video was a great start to my day. Love that."
"there are so many videos about dudes working out on youtube, i spend 1-2 hours everyday running so i can peak about 3-4 times a year lol we are on the same boat, except on one side there are people shaming u for working so hard at something like make up. i think the thing that can really help improve our mental state and the world is community support, doing the shit you love with as many people as possible and having genuine bonding, the internet should be a tool for this aim not something that replaces community, same shit for organizing to destroy capitalism but we out here afraid to interact with eachother cuz some of our ideas are fucking crazy and someone might launch a psychic transphobic, capitalist, racist, sexist, ableist attack that makes u want to crawl back to Das Kapital and facetune app"
"This is probably going to come out wrong(not unusual for me) if guys looked like you when I was younger I would have been nearly straight."
"every video you release, I become a bigger lesbian."
"You do look great hon and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise."
"'secretly falling in love with them while quietly dying inside' - now I feel called out on my crush on Natalie..."
"Oh wow yeah as a femme grad student I am so not here for the ~not like other girls~ bs about appearance. But apparently me wearing makeup to work has resulted in my advisor associating my makeup with me 'looking happy' and not wearing makeup with 'looking sick'."
"YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL WOW"
"M I L L I M E T R E S   O F   B O N E"
"If bernie gets blocked again then any 'democratic' solution is dead."
"A few weeks ago Kat Black mentioned that if she didn't have a YouTube channel, she probably wouldn't even think about being trans. And I thought, fuck you Kat Black. I mean, I love Kat. But I think about being trans at least twelve times a day. I vibe with you so much when you talk about this stuff. I don't know how you do it. I stopped making videos at least in part because I couldn't stand to look at my stupid man face and hear my stupid man voice on camera any more. And yet I haven't been misgendered in real life for three years. This video was so so so much mood. ❤️"
"I feel morte of myself falling away the further away  I am from completing transition. I woud trade bottom surgery 100X over to not be sir'd the minute I walk into a store. Love your vids, but some are harder to chew through than others."
"It's not really as complicated as it seems. Everyone, wants to be loved and accepted. Being beautiful gets you that, or the facsimile of that, instantly. Cis dudes might interpret that as 'women wear makeup to get guys to want them', but it's really got very little to do with being actively pursued sexually and much more to do with the safety of tribe. We're hardwired to need tribe. Exile and rejection are among the worst pains we're capable of. Be beautiful = be accepted = safety, at least to your lizard brain."
"As beautiful as ever c:"
"I am genuinely curious because I've always wondered this. How do you know if you really are another gender if you can't know how someone of that other gender experiences things? Like, I'm a guy, but I don't even really know how other guys experience their gender nor how women experience theirs. I kind of really only know how I experience things, if that ha."
"This really reminds me of the thoughts and feelings I had last year when I had top surgery. It's a very different set of social pressures for a transmasculine person, but I really think the experience is very similar in more ways than not, probably because it's not entirely about social pressure or conventional gendered appearance standards. The post-op depression was a doozy, and we need to talk more about it."
"that sequence top is no"
"Where is the hour long edit of “Biological Sequins for Sleep”?"
">'Its inner beauty that counts.' >Spends thousands of dollars changing outer appearence."
"Well done!  I'm over 50 and fat. I stopped caring quite as much what people think about what I am wearing a little less than a decade ago and started wearing mostly only what I like. But, there is that part of me, the inner voice of the child I was, that just wants to be pretty (no matter how much my significant other thinks I am). But, as a cis-white woman, I look in the mirror and see my grandfather's jowls. I look at pictures of myself as a child and only see how boyish my looks were, no matter that I was in a dress. There are days I even wonder about getting FFS and if it would finally let me be pretty, if I also lost a lot of weight, too. Beauty standards suck."

"She has no style She has no grace This Point has a pretty face"
"I was having a major episode of body dysmorphia today and then you dropped this video. Thanks, Natalie <3"
"As soon as I heard Sophie at the beginning I knew this would be my favorite contra vid of all time"
"good luck and ty for all you've done"
"opening with sophie is how to get me to watch all of your video"
"Natalie, you will always be enough for me."
"Holy shit.... This is brilliant."
"Oh as a lesbian I’m not chilling, I’m obsessed with my appearance (perhaps though in a way that allows for faaar less effort)   I’m glad you acknowledged the place from which the “not like other girls” thing comes from, For some it’s the frustration of feeling out of place, which unfortunately can mean jumping on the misogyny bus cause it gives them validation"
"queen!!! omfg i love you"
"How she kept saying journey I broke down."
"Honestly so comforting to see someone else talk about how much they want to be pretty. Holy crap do I care. Everyone says they don't, but damn I wanna look cute!"
"I'm more concerned about her voice. It seems like she's lost her ability to alter tone or express emotion at all. Good vid though."
"THANK GODDDD I've been waiting for a new video for so loooong. haven't even watched it yet and love it already Edit: Also, thank you for that Sophie song, it fits perfectly  Edit (again): On a more serious note, this video hit me pretty hard. As a gay man who sees a lot of those pretty boy instagays and pays close attention to all the hot male celebrities and general, I have struggled with body image issues years. I rarely think I am attractive and avoid mirrors when I can help it, except when I'm staring at my face/body criticizing it. I feel guilty for caring about my appearance when there are more important things to care about. Its also led to me to have pretty wack eating habits like eating only a couple crackers one day then entire containers of nutella and entire cereal boxes the next, because I decide one day I look terrible and should never eat again and decide the next day not to care because nutella tastes good. I also have a pretty wack exercise schedule for the same reasons, like running ten miles and doing hundreds of pushups every day to no exercise at all. My only problem with this video is your conclusion about making your own style. I have tried this so many times in my life but usually give up out of laziness and the feeling that I don't deserve to look good. It's just this constant cycle of distaste for the way I look. If anyone has any advice, it would be appreciated."
"Is no one going to talk about how the intro is American horror story vibes"
"'Female beauty matters so much, because patriarchy.' I'm not sure how that tracks? Didn't you jsut a few minutes earlier talk about at length how women don't put on mkaeup for men and how you'd wear makeup regardless if there were men around or not? How is that patriarchy?"
"Does anyone know who made the painting in the intro?"
"I've been averse to dresses and feminine looks from preschool age. Not trans, somewhere in the middle and always have been. The fact that I am in a male dominated field does not affect this."
"I think you're beautiful. Just saying.  You can take this as a sycophantic form of flattery in an ocean of comments of the same strain, but I genuinely think you're gorgeous. I think it's important to iterate that you aren't gorgeous in the same way as these disruptively enchanting Instagram girls. Those little 'bioqueens' embody nubile, youthful and very soft beauty, and that's not the type of beauty you possess. As long as you compare yourself to that type of beauty, there will always be this grating dysphoria. I'm a total hypocrite because I'm trans, 5'9 and have a long face and I do the same! We are of different types of beauty, gorgeously attractive to those who prefer our style of appearance.  Especially when you were in the mirror in that black top, it really brought out your long neck and made you look so elegant and beautiful in a way that transcends the transience of youth. Beautiful in a way that I can envision you at 40, 50 and beyond.  Let's try less to be fuckable (because that fades) and try to be beautiful instead: Feminine, caring, radiant, healthy, well-groomed, good style, graceful, etc. - these don't fade!  I adored the video, by the way. Such excellent videography. You're talented, and you're so fucking philosophical, it makes me nut. Bye."
"Hi mami I luvvvvvvvv you ,, Your editing ooooohhhhmygod i just nutted"
"That’s basically my skincare routine, I feel seen."
"That top is fuckin killer, tho"
"Maybe it maybelline, maybe it's bone structure, maybe its obscene swamp goblin magic. Who knows."
"20:11 - no bullshit, Natalie actually looks amazing without makeup (but also with makeup ofc)."
"i can imagine how writing this video was probably therapeutic for you but i sure hope you have other better outlets and are taking care of your mental health. i have a lot of Hot Takes on the subject of beauty and definitely recommend you read the history of beauty by umberto eco but my main takeaway from this video is that i'm worried about you. i don't think parasocial relationships are delusional, i'm fully aware you don't know a thing about me but i know the impact you've had in my life and many others and that's enough to know my worry about you is genuine. i'm trans and relate heavily to how you perceive yourself, matter of fact today was a specially tough day and i was writing a self motivation text to myself when the notification for this video arrived agdkagdjagdkagd having a trans woman as a therapist, doing theater classes where i get to have fun with my body and consuming a lot of art done by trans and gnc folk helps me a lot. i kinda hope you hire an editor so you won't have to stare at yourself as much but your editing is fucking perfect so it wouldn't be easy to find a replacement. i hope you actually read this long incoherent comment and i hope you get to emotionally connect to it. if you can't, don't beat yourself up, i'm emotionally disconnected from most things on my phone."
"I'm a cis woman with PCOS, which causes 'excess' hair on the stomach, chest, neck, etc. I feel like I don't have a word for the disgust and hate I feel towards my coarse, dark body hair. Is gender dysphoria a correct term for this? Obviously I'm not trans but I don't know how to describe my feelings."
"Trying to attract women while trying to be subtle and dying inside is a big mood."
"Tried to tell my friend about your 'sweet sequins'... and ended up with ' Swequin'"
"Love your channel but the last like 7 videos were all in the TS subject matter. Granted you’re transitioning so it’s consuming your life and you can post WeverTF you want on your own channel but I want to hear your thoughts on other subjects that doesn’t involve transsexualism. Any subject."
"Sheesh...That intro... *Edit: you're leveling up"
"Real Poppy energy at the beginning 😂 Happy for you ❤️"
"Following your arguments, -- e.g., around the 24 minute point on this one --I can see why you dropped out of  philosophy. But you're very smart for a very hot woman. Just gorgeous and funny and clever."

"Nick, why don't you admit already that you have a mental illness and require treatment for it?  There *is* treatment available for men who want to be women, you know.  Treatment that doesn't require electroshock therapy.  Please cease this fuckery and please cease influencing children to travel down the same path."
"You are beautiful, as someone who is beginning to transition, I really wish I was more femenine. I struggled to even tell you were trans untill you outright said it in the first video I watched from you. To be honest I feel pretty whenever I wear a dress, though that's only when I'm alone, and in my room. Because I have anxiety about showing myself in public"
"Mama-Contra has returned!!!!! Yay!!!!!"
"That intro, holy shit. Production value for days"
"This might be your most depressing video so far."

"Dear god girl, I know you're really good at it and all, but get someone else to edit your videos, I don't even look in mirrors"
"As a Pan banging about in my kitchen cupboard: I give zero shits if you 'pass' or not. You are a gorgeous goddess to me. You attract me with your big brains, not boobs or face angles my dear 😍😍😍 You, being beautiful you, is simply enough!"

"Cis grad girl here (yes, I hate many parts of myself): I am endless envious of the women around me who a) can afford make up, b) know how to apply make up, c) feel comfortable wearing make up daily or alternatively d) don't feel comfortable wearing it in academic environments but do it anyway because they want to.   Make me into you."
"congrats on 600K!!!"
"This is great! I really feel like I'm through that self-reflection process with you. Fantastic script and execution!"
"I gotta re-watch the video cause I got lost in her eyes"
"The point at 25:18-25:40 is so important. I think this is something we all need to wrap our heads around better as we discuss the subjectivity and potential oppressiveness of beauty standards."
"“...But thy eternal summer shall not fade, nor lose possession of that fair thou owest. Nor shall death brag thou wonderous in his shade, when eternal lines to time thou growest. So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, so long lives this and this gives life to thee.” Love you Natalie ~<3"

"I want to be annoyed and dismissive (it's a shitty instinct and im working on it) and say ok you're thin, white, and can afford to be stylish and people would die to look like you there are people destroying themselves because they don't look like you so stop...BUT there's not a thing external about feeling beautiful. We live in a capitalism and it creates self loathing as an economic principal there will never be an amount of beauty that is 'good enough' we are always flawed. I'm in my thirties now and I actively avoid mirrors because I hate my goddamn everything and I have since about 10 years old but I was looking at old pictures not even that old but like 2 years ago and though 'fuck, I wish I still looked like that'. It's illogical because I hated looking 'like that' because I was too fat too black too queer and not queer enough etc etc. Beauty is the whole Sisyphus thing except there's not really a way to imagine him happy. I honestly don't know how we get past it because even with representation we still only represent those closest to the dominant group. Thanks for reading the shit I should be saving for my therapist 😂"
"I don't like body hair on a woman because I don't like the little fucking hairs at the back of my throat cuz I just gave um a tongue bath."
"I'm a trans dude who hasnt gone on hormones yet literally because im still a vain baby worried it might make me 'ugly' (fear of acne and unwanted body hair)  so this video resonates with me a lot"
"I think I understand. When you spend so long focusing on some part of yourself that you don't like, you get into a pattern of obsessive thinking. When you're trans, you're constantly thinking about parts of your body that make you dysphoric. So, even when those parts go away, you've already gotten into a pattern of focusing on these problems and obsessing over ways to fix them. Even if the things that made you dysphoric are gone, you're already in the habit of obsessive thinking. You'll find new issues with your body. It's hard to rewire your brain."
"if all men died today, fucking party. No f's for respect, pop the champagne ladies and those that liest....its not betwixt now, but you know who i mean, we celebrating!"
"Its normal to want to become what represses you, to be the strong one, hence no longer be the weak one - since beauty is power, wanting to be powerful by being beautiful is very relatable... like feeling like no one would abandon me if I were prettier, or that I would be less disapointing...  I also feel guilty by wanting beauty when I know its a power strugle, and that it represent the things that I hate in society... I also know its a eternal quest, to feel beautiful has to do with so much, and it is cheaper and more guarantied to reflect and try to better the emotional part, like confidence, style, toxic comparison, over criticsim , working with what I got instead of foccusing on being someone else, looking for the best ways to better my stronger features... try to bring pragmatic thinking to balance the emotional roller coaster of being just human in a world of make-belieave majestic queens of angelic unrealistic beauty. I feel you honey,  and dont think you're shallow. Like a girl said on another comment 'my politics dont protect my feelings'..   P.s. i happen to think you do look lovely, everyday (or vídeo, since I dont see you daily) a little bit more so"

"omg congrats on ffs!"
"I want to be beautiful. Beauty is atractive, not just superficially. Beauty makes my heart beat stronger. But I do think that beauty is not constant, it varies an it's different for everyone. I have a friend i find gorgeous, and society (and her) disagree; i get why, but for me her beautiful parts are so beautiful that they compensate the rest.  My tips for feeling beautiful (that i use) are: 1) find details you like about yourself, like your eyes, long lashes, brows, hair, skin color, nails, etc; then add more and more things you like and try to accentuate them. For me it started with liking my eyes and nails. 2) look for people that have the same features as you that you think look good. For example, my face shape (which I don't quite like) is oval, so I try to find oval faces that look good and find resemblances with myself.  I truly don't know if I am good looking or ugly, I'm just guessing."

"LOVE THE SOPHIE SHOUTOUT YESSSS"
"Natalie, you’ve made me sad.  I’ve never really had anyone in my life who earnestly cared about me or my potential, but I am and always have been a really curious student. Like, talk to me about a really specific (nerdy) topic that I might have no idea about but would bore most people to tears and you couldn’t pay me to lose interest.  I’ve always wanted an adult to look up to, and I feel like my teachers should be those adults... but I’m a remotely pretty white girl so it’s just assumed that I have so much going for me that my teachers don’t need to waste their time. I’ve even had teachers who really looked down on me at first but who do a complete 180 once they hear a bit about the way my life sucks.  I don’t get it. Is it really so hard to believe that I need someone to care about me too?"
"The whole 'forgiving oneself for wanting to be beautiful' thing reminds me of that line from SharkTale: 'Deep down, I'm really superficial.' This is a sentiment that I've owned for a long time. This idea that physical attractiveness is very important to me, and always will be. It's something I care about the same way people care about someone's taste in art or music. Sort of like a hobby, a little signifier that I'll likely get along with someone. Now, this doesn't mean that I actively dislike people who aren't physically attractive, simply that I value beauty the same way I value art or nature."
"CUNTY CELINE"
"I struggled with this my entire childhood. I was always a healthy weight, but everyone in  my close family was much skinnier than me. The small digs at my weight and larger chest built up quickly and by high school I had been starving myself on and off for years. It took me going to college, being away from the judgement of my family, to realize that my body was fucking amazing and perfectly healthy. I really started to love myself when I was forced to step away from the toxic situation i was living in. There was never anything wrong with me, but that hate was all I had ever known. I urge everyone to pay careful attention to when they feel the worst about themselves, assess the situation and find what triggered the negative thoughts, and remove the trigger as much as you can from your life."
"That intro was so cool"
"I hope you don't take this as an insult but I mean it as a positive when I say I think you look like Celine Dion!"
"Girl...I love you so much."
"Why aren't medical scientists doing something about big ass pores tho"
"We all individually choose what’s beautiful or ugly, it’s very subjective and changes with time. Feeling beautiful and seeing the beauty in yourself is the only way to actually convince others of it, doesn’t matter if you look like a supermodel or a trash can"
"YES BRING BACK THE ASMR lol"
"I have a hard time with beauty. I find people beautiful based off their personnality, their charisma, and if I like them or their persona. It might sounds cheesy but I really have a hard time figuring out if someone is beautiful or not when I don’t know them. The only time a stranger seems beautiful to me is if I think they have an unique and cool dressing style or if I think they seem like an interesting individual. I prefer people in real life than on their pictures — I NEVER find someone more beautiful on a photo than in real life — because their behavior and manners are whats beautiful to me.   I’m sure others feel the same way but it’s weird hearing so many people easily placing personnality-less faces on scales when I really can’t seem do that."
"People almost never do anything for a narrow, single-minded reason and I really appreciate that you take the time to untangle that web instead of settling for an easy answer."

"This is really hard to watch.  I'm legit crying because your results look so good and I know I'll never be able to afford FFS myself and I'm stuck with this horrifc face forever barring some unexpected windfall or complete restructuring of american healthcare."
"Double eyelids have pale skin had been a beauty standard in east Asia since ancient times before we even saw a European, but sure Karen the white girl from Tumblr, please keep lecturing us how we are so desperately worshipping you 😂  Asian beauty standards are as arbitrary and unreasonable as western beauty standards. You guys like tan skin and big butts and big boobs, I don’t see Asians condescendingly psycho-analyse that and come to super racist conclusion like “oooh white woman are spraying themselves tan because they want to look more “coloured”. They must be worshipping us omg!!”  It’d be great if people can live their lives without being psycho-analysed by people who don’t even know them. Make up is internalised sexism, FFS is internalised transphobia, weight loss is internalised fat phobia, hell now putting sunscreen on is internalised racism.   p.s. this isn’t aimed at Natalie just people who think that way generally"
"Women tend to pay more attention to each other physically... like, I pay more attention to other women’s makeup, appearance and fashion. I feel really complimented when women notice my attention to blending that shadow flawlessly or how flawless skin looks, sweets.  I have to say, also, for me putting on makeup - the actual act of putting on makeup is therapeutic and putting time into my skincare is therapeutic. It feels good, it helps me mediate and I feel it makes me feel more put together.  And, honestly, I don’t think I am vain for spending time on it! Dang it... maybe a little. And, we all know, everything but man, I feel very complicated by my impulse to be beautiful and thinking about things intellectually. I think it starts from inside and what the media uses...  Sorry I don’t know how to articulate exactly what I want to say."
"LeftTube, makeup, and SOPHIE, and all in one video? the only way to make this more powerful is to get Claire Saffitz or Brad Leone in on the action"
"This video is utterly cathartic. I have been dealing with self image issues since my early teens, and being gay (whose comunity puts a huge emphasis on looks) and deemed nerd/geek/intellectual (whose attitude towards appearance is to scoff at it) created a contradiction within me. Some days I just want to be pretty like those skinny twinks on Instagram, and I feel bad about it, because I also think that's shallow. Some days I wonder, were I handsome I wouldn't be alone and feel loved, yet nobody would fall for an ugly guy. It has been futile to try to reconcile this disparity, and I once even tried to kill myself for such reason. I don't even know what I am doing or should do but perhaps there's some hope for me. This video was beyond inspirational for me, you described a problem I always had, and maybe there's a solution and a way to be happy. Thank you very much."

"Jason Wynn from the spawn cartoon is a beautiful man  🌈🙏🏿"
"No false internet flattery, you actually look stunning. Your hair especially is on point this video! Congrats on your surgery, and thanks for the thought provoking content as always"
"One tip I've heard recently is to INCREASE your awareness of how beautiful you find other people. Hone in on people you think look pretty, and realize how diverse that group (hopefully) is, and how easy it is for your brain to quickly decide someone has a pretty face. The more you do that, it'll help your brain realize that lots of people will make the same easy, instant judgement of 'pretty' when they look at you. Idk if I worded that great but yeah basically increase your confidence in other people and it'll increase your confidence in yourself because you realize how easy it is to approve of loads of other people, so others must approve of you. (Obviously this idea doesn't work for people who are intensely critical and disapproving of a majority of others and hold EVERYONE to modelesque standards and can't find beauty in passing faces on the street... in which case, folks who think like that don't have any inner beauty anyway :/)... like idk I find it super easy to find people's faces and bodies to be attractive/pretty, and when people put effort into their hair/makeup/outfit then it makes even more of an impact, so, when I go out and I'm wearing an outfit and presenting myself in a way that at least looks like I tried to look nice, I find it a lot easier to accept compliments and feel attractive in the eyes of others because I know there are people who think the same way...?"
"Natalie's hot.       Also, this video made me cry.   Fuckin' brava, Nat, wow!"
"Regarding double eyelids in Asians, my mother is Chinese from Guangzhou. She has double eyelids naturally. Women from her part of China have long considered to be beautiful and were sought after by Chinese emperors for concubines/wives. So, maybe the desire for double eyelids has been enhanced by western influences, but it did not originate there."

"I hop you gave the surgeon a good tip. he (or she) did a good job."
"I had a breast reduction when I was 18. When people would find out the would A) fill in the story before I could explain why with 'For health reasons, right?' or 'For back problems?' or B) Quote that scene from 'Superbad' as if it was their own original line. Most of the time I would just nod along but either way, other people didn't want my surgery to be for me to feel more comfortable in my body- they wanted (what they deemed) a 'real reason'. Which I found really odd a first. When I started correcting them that 'I didn't like the way my body looked' it really put people off.  So this video helped explain things I've been trying to figure out for years.   But now, I am, just chilling."
"You are one of the most stylish beings i know in the universe 💕"
"Absolutely killer vid as usual. I love that sequin top, its fucking beautiful. Congrats on your surgery and hope you feel better soon. You ARE beautiful Natalie <3 I just dont care about my looks when I go out, infact, I almost put no effort just to fuck with people, like bet you think I care about your approval haan? I DONT!  (except in corporate inteeviews, that shit triggers my inner leftist on a daily basis)."
"I literally woke up for this. Thank you o auspicious mother"
"Yep, I live a martial arts trans lady life, my body will never be able to live up to broad standards but needs be cultivated an individual style and kindly recognize that in others. Totes gross to be nice."
"you could do a whole video of running your nails across sequins and honestly be here for it"
"SOPHIE IN A CONTRAPOINTS VID????? YESSSSSS"
"oh...... wig"
"the triple video title self-reference is queer culture"
"You are ABSOLUTELY NOT a shabby aging transvestite! I have never seen you as that and I never will! Surgery or not."
"That grad student comment hit hard, not gonna lie.  That said, I was gushing about how pretty and perfect you are literally yesterday."
"Hi ma also I am a girl also I love you and think you're the most beautiful creature and I totally wrote many comments saying lewd (or actually very creepy) stuff to you but I erased them because I was scared you'd hate me. What I mean is you're beautiful!!!"
"my anxiety over personal beauty REALLY frustrates me more than any other self-esteem issue because it all feels so pointless. at one my point my mom and my sister wanted me to get nose surgery - but I probably never will, just because I know it'll only be the start of a cycle to 'improve' my appearance which will never end. I totally support plastic surgery because I know it works for other people and makes them feel better in their own skin, but I'm scared of resenting my body more than I already do"
"You know what, I don't know what 'being a woman' is for me. Yes I have 'soft features' like tits and a round face, but I also feel incredibly neutral in my 'feminine' presence. I am a woman, but not because I am beautiful. I have small lips, flabby stomach, and weirdly shapeless hips. I think that I cannot see myself as 'female' because it means I have to be pretty as well. I don't know. Maybe its the brain malfunctioning to preserve itself."
"Lol you are an enchantress with words, I love the image of an old transvestite being a feral cat wandering the ailes of a liqour store."
"Trust me nothing is more womanly than finding a problem to 'fix', fixing it, and then finding another thing to fix lmao welcome to womanhood."
"I hate watching your videos cause they remind me I'm sad but I hate not watching them cause you're such a queen"
"1. Thank you Miss Points for talking about beauty in an analytical way, and affirming style over beauty, since I myself have never felt particularly beautiful but I always feel like I have my own look 2. Your face looks fucking great! Those doctors did a really good job 3. Clear acrylics are the absolute worst trend of 2019."
"You are the best teacher I've ever had. Thank you Natalie"
"I relate too much"
"ERIK SATIE😤👌😩💦💦"
"You look like Céline Dion at certain points of this video."
"I missed you Natalie!!!"
"who's the greatest philosopher of our time? NATALIE MOTHERFUCKIN WYNN!"
"Man made climate change isn't real though"
"Also zoe blade fucking rocks"
"Beauty is associated with youth? Hummm? I'd suggest that you are thinking of just a version of beauty, a simple form. Perhaps you are being more conventional than you realize?"
"There are actions people perform not because they intend to but to perform a certain inbuilt purpose. The true reason we do something and the thing that we tell ourselves to justify that thing we're doing is often completely divorced from eachother. So daddy Peterson still has a point where he says makeup is to encourage sexual interest. It can be true at the same time as not being intended to encourage sexual interest.   Likewise you illustrate the point with men claiming to not like makeup while at the same time, only demonstrating that when they dont realise there is makeup.   We're all slaves to our nature, so persuing makeup and beauty can be the reason to suck dick at the same time as getting dick. Primarily, because evolutionary, we've been designed over time to be the best at gathering dicks to suck weather we like it or not."
"Hey, here's a really cool secret:  when you're nonbinary, your gender expression is often ONLY style. Throw the gender norms out the window and wear whatever you want, be free. When there's no way to pass as your gender to most people, it really opens things up. I wear a lot of more masculine clothes mixed with floral ties and dangly earrings and sparkly rainbow eye shadow because WHY NOT. So yeah, style > beauty for sure."
"Wanting to be stereotypically beautiful is valid. It’s also very understandable in our society.  I’d say the vast majority of people wish to be stereotypically beautiful even if they don’t admit it.   I will say that a good skincare routine is important. Try stopping for a week and you’ll see the difference. Once we get into a good routine and our skin is happy we begin to see it as the new normal and it starts to feel like it’s not doing anything, but it is. It helps our skin stay at 100% for years longer than it would naturally.   Anyways, I think you look beautiful both with and without makeup.  I don’t know about your daily makeup but your camera makeup is on point every time."
"Maybe this will help your psyche maybe not but just remember with no makeup most girls just look like boys with long hair. And most cis women have masculine features too. My brow bone looks like yours pre ffs and my nose is bigger than my dad's. Just try and remind yourself of that bb okay I'm done love u v much pls come to brazil"
"f"
"You look great,  but maybe back off the purple eye shadow just a bit."
"I think you look beautiful, and I’m not sure if you would take this as a compliment but I certainly mean it as one, if I saw you walking down the street I would just think “oh she’s pretty”. I am a cis straight male just so you know. 😺"
"It's been so long, I feel like I'm going on your personal transgender journey with you."
"I hate this video cuz the skincare routine is so effing relatable in my life right now lmao. I'm reaching 30 & my skincare routine is about 10 steps and 30 products longer than it was ever lol."
"The timing of this is just too perfect for me. I've been in a spiral of breakdowns over my body recently and I have this undying want to fix all the shit I see wrong with my body."
"Excellent video Natalie. Glad your surgery went well. Keep up the good work!"
"THOU MUST F A C E M A X"
"Natural makeup = 'no makeup' like it😂😂😂"
"I didn’t get the confidence to start an online dating account and start dating for the first time in my life at age 26 until I put my face on PhotoFeeler (a handy website) to answer the question “am I handsome or not?” When I saw my best photos get into the >95 percentile range I was like “oh, fuck... I’m good looking?”"
"Well, I'm long of tooth and straight, but I think you are pretty cute...regardless of where you started your journey. Carry on."
"I'm sorry for calling you muppet hentai."
"dank vid nice job"
"Let me assure the women here that men also feel ugly and undesired you aren’t alone. Maybe it’s that I’m gay and should be burned at the stake?"
"Thought you had the surgery months ago when I first stumbled across your channel. Looks really damn good both ways and either way. Congrats, different strokes for different folks—everybody deserve to feel good in their own body, mind and soul. Life might as well be a prison-hell otherwise."
"I don’t think feminizing surgery is really necessary for every trans person. I think you’re beautiful no matter how much you still see the man/woman you used to be. That being said I can understand wanting to ‘pass’ as you put it and I think you looked amazing before and look amazing now. As long as it benefits you tho it doesn’t really matter what I or anyone else thinks."
"I have settled into a routine of not looking at myself in the mirror unless I'm shaving. Hahahaha, so healthy."
"Alright Jackal of the internet here to say, the surgery done looks amazing, the differences are difficult to tell at first glance (and with out a side by side) but definitely, subtly very helpful for 'passing'. Alright Jackal out"
"You look great Natalie! As a trans man I want the masculine face surgery and I agree with your points completely."
"Are you ever going to get lip filler? Please don’t over do it, but I can see you getting just a tiny tiny bit! You look fab"
"As an afab enby I struggle a lot with the idea of beauty. I'm a professional makeup artist and love throwing colours on my face and I love wearing sparkly things and of course I know that presentation is very different from identity, but I don't look like the recognizably androgynous nb and that bothers me too. I generally fall into the camp of 'look and be however you want, everyone else be damned' but I feel like i'm constantly on the defensive and its honestly exhausting. Not to mention all the bullshit that is mixed up with the beauty industry. But Natalie is right, style is something uniquely yours and it is or isn't gendered depending on whether you want it to be. I would like to be recognized as nb but I suppose when it comes down to it I would like to be recognized as nb the way I am and I don't want to have to be masc presenting to get it."
"When the screen goes negative the reflected light in her eyes look like two grinning faces."
"As a transman who had to dress up in the full femme attire for a job interview today... Yeah.  I feel this."
"'They're biological sequins'  I actually cannot 😂😂😂"
"You're fucking beautiful"
"Your profile is seriously so fucking cute now"
"makeup is an art, you look beautiful natalie, and plastic surgery helps those who want to bring THEIR own ideals into reality. if a person is persecuted just bc they wear makeup or get ps, its the same as forcing religion down their throats. A personal choice means its a personal decision, so butt out of my loving me! to the persecutors: Stop killing  the vibe and harshing other people's mellow! find a way to love yourself more so you can hate less! EDIT: it doesn't matter if you are hetero or LGBTQ+. if it makes you feel more comfortable with yoursel, then do it."
"your surgery looks great! you look so pretty! you honestly pass 99% more"
"Jowels? Love that for you."
"You do realize a large portion of what dysphoria is is a false feeling of being ugly coupled with a feeling of beauty and femininity being tied (society and media made that a thing BTW) and so once you are triggered into a point of being dysphoric, its like many psychological things where you now need to basically overcompensate to get to a neutral, think of the situation where being sad makes things that would make you happy makes you less happy, or whatever, there were YouTube videos about it for a while, it was this big thing, so no, your vision of the girl you are and your vision of the girl you want to be are no longer separable and were not the moment you weren't the girl you are inside, its up to you when to stop tbh, but I hope you can be honest with yourself and those around you as to when you go from one to the other and what is just extra to be beautiful, because its only up to you to decide, and you can even go back and forth, something can be to make you the girl you are, but be done after something to make you the girl you want to be, a artificial standard could be made by taking either the most manly or ugly girl you feel you would be comfortable being (yes its not you, but I just mean if you were suddenly her or born her instead) or the average of all girls in the general group you fit in (ethnocultural?) Now even with hrt, shaving is harder for males than females, and so being that for the most part that is what your body is, then it serves to assume that it is of more benefit to you to have hair removal than for a hormone neutral cis woman to have, and even still you would benefit more from it than a testosterone high cis woman like my mom, though the difference is less, simply put, shaving is hard, and financially for you personally, its likely to be an investment"

"Can totally relate to the 'they say these nice things but are they just lying?' feeling. Not specifically looks related, but still."
"I would 100% watch a ContraPoints ASMR video"
"Its funny-- I've actually been thinking a lot about beauty and societal beauty standards lately and then along comes your video!  You articulated perfectly what I've been feeling re: being 'woke' and aware of how female beauty standards are the product of years of patriarchy/racism, but how that awareness doesn't change your desires to conform to it.  A point I'd like to add that I find *very* interesting is   a sentiment that I've felt and that I've seen echoed on social media-- how it can be so much easier to find OTHER people beautiful when you start internally critiquing our society's beauty standards, but how you still use those standards very harshly against yourself at the same time.  To use myself as an example: I'm an artist and recently I found a metric shitton of my art from highschool. After I got done cringing, I noticed something. I had mostly drawn white people-- all conventionally attractive and thin. But after I underwent my Leftist Awakening™ my art changed. I drew more POC and people with more diverse body-types, because I was now acknowledging the beauty of more than just cis-gendered white people. I can honestly say that I've done a pretty good job dismantling those racist and ableist perceptions about what beauty looks like when it comes to OTHER people. But then I turn to the mirror and take in my mixed-race features and look at my body that used to be 120lbs and is now 200 and think: 'god you're so fat. And look at that frizzy hair and big nose. No wonder you're single'.  I think this unfair double standard comes from a similar place to imposter syndrome-- 'other people are good enough, but *I'm* not.'  The silver-lining of course is that it's just your brain being mean to you and not an objective representation of reality!"
"26:20 Tabby!"
"Tbh...I kinda look like you (especially before the FFS). Some people thought I was trans but nope I'm a cis woman (because my bones be looking male I guess). My brother is actually trans tho, so when someone hears we have someone who's trans in my family they assume it's me. While my brother has a more feminine babyface. So yeah biology is wack."
"This channel is gold"
"I was about to spew my opinions on your appearance when I suddenly remembered it literally doesn't hurt me whatsoever to keep it to my fucking self"
"I related to this so much I felt like I was watching myself talk"
"It's hard being a 6 indeed, but at the same time, this lesbian is just chilling."
"Does anyone else always think she means 'For Fuck's Sake' when she says FFS? 😁"
"Couldn't people concievable not want to wear fake nails, shave, and wear fake eyelashes, not because they hate beauty and glamour, but because doing these things is uncomfortable, time consuming, and expensive?  Or god forbid that their personal aesthetic isn't based on having these things?  Seems like you're being a little judgmental of less 'femme' presenting women."
"Girl, am not saying it because am your fan but you look awesome! Damn! So freaking gorgeous and also...I feel a baby Celine Dion vibe"
"As an r/skincareaddiction subscriber, I screamed a little bit when Contra skipped the SUNSCREEN"
"6:12 You freaked me out because I was updating Windows 10 and right at that moment, it wanted to reboot and I failed to click the wait until later button."
"Immediately hearing Faceshopping as soon as you open a new Contra video?    It's more likely than you think."

"But deadass can you drop the skincare brands you use....."
"Every fucking thing"
"For a while, I went through a phase where physical appearance was something I heavily internalized and unhealthily worried about. I began thinking that there was something wrong with me as to why I've never been in a relationship, and I blamed it on the way I looked - thin, kind of awkward, a slightly misshapen head from a birth accident, glasses, etc. The worst part about it was not the fact that I felt unattractive, and thus unwanted; it was the fact that I *knew* these were unhealthy thoughts that ultimately have no bearing on who I am as a person. Despite that, I couldn't shake it. It especially made me feel bad because I'm a man. You know, in our society, men aren't supposed to care about things like this.  It wasn't until my last year at college where my desires changed - namely, I lost the desire to look attractive. I knew that there was little I could do to change how I looked to other people, no matter how much I cried over it. And being a philosophy student, I was introduced to some profound thinking that had an actual effect on my life and the way I perceived the world. So, for me, the 'critiquing' kind of did lead to a significant change in me. Now that I feel as though there is no way to logically square identity with physical appearance, I've let go from wishing I could look a certain way. Of course, I keep myself well-groomed, but the fact that the way I look has no causal relationship with who *I* am as a being has sort of done away with my self-deprecating outlook.  Do I still feel as though I look ugly? Of course. But it simply doesn't matter to me anymore. In one of your videos, Contrapoints, you ask an important question - which matters more, the way things are, or the way things appear? I believe that the way things are, for who an individual human is, is not the way that human appears physically. And the way things actually are has always tended to matter more to me.  It's a sort of freedom that is hard to describe. I'm not remotely suggesting that people who care about their beauty are wrong - I mean, not only did I do so at one point, but I perfectly understand why people care.  But to be at ease with how I look is a liberating feeling that I don't believe you can get by chasing beauty."
"Well, I'd like to show you my bone structure even more now."
"I'm trying to come up with the perfect, nuanced way to tell you I think you're really really pretty (and were before the surgery too!) and how much I admire your confidence and/or ability to fake confidence but then I remember how every time someone tells *me* I'm beautiful I shrug it off and label them as a sycophant so...  YAS MAMA SLAY YOU GLOW GIRL  hope you're doing okay and the pain levels are getting better GET IT GURRRRRRRL ON FLEEK"

"So is it good that I'm semi-blind enough to not notice minor imperfections."
"What happens to the uglys in the world"
"my style is shit lol"
"That “feeling beautiful one day a month” thing is real. It’s how I know I’m a few days away from swinging back into depression because my mania makes me feel like the hottest woman alive. As for the rest of the month, I have to remind myself that “pretty” is useless. My worth lies in my intelligence and my talent."
"You're not a Gigi Gorgeous and you're also not a.... whoever criticizes society and is popular on youtube idk you're one of the only ones I watch lol. You bring your own valuable perspective as someone who criticizes the Society we Live In while still acknowledging the ways in which you participate in that and not shunning anything in life that would suggest complacency with a hetero-patriarchal capitalist commodified etc etc society. Which is refreshing, because as much as I can't fully relate to the Gigis of the world, I also can't relate to those who claim to not care about their appearances or material possessions at all."

"NATALIE CONTRAPOINTS!!! I wonder Did you ever read The Beauty Myth by Naomi Wolf & if so what did you think of it?"
"I was wondering what you're up to one of these days... Didnt realize the difference at first, but the pre-post made it pretty obvious, looks pretty good. :)"
"finally you uploaded you fucking bich!"
"I disagree, I don't think chaging society will do much, we're slaves of our own biology. Everything, from beauty standarts to everything else, what you deem a social construct is human nature in action. The only way is to change our biology, and I can't see a way to do so. It's like changing gravity. So be as vein as you want to be, in the end, nothing matters. People who claim to want destroy the beauty standarts just want the moral high ground they didn't aquire with beauty. Everyone is stupid."
"You were still pretty before the FFS, but I'm still glad you feel happier and more comfortable w yourself after the changes you got."

"Dancing Detective Pikachu? But I thought she asked what was going through *her* head? GET OUT OF MY HEAD, NATALIE!"
"13:30 can confirm not true"
"I think another solid point on the 'makeup is used to gain male sexual attraction' is I am asexual and love makeup, and also dress revealingly. I'd appreciate if we would stop sexualizing physicality in of it's self cause I'm stuck existing in a body and it is not an invitation for you to tell me what I desire xD Like my best friend also loves looking fabulous and dashing but he isn't trying to woo anyone to bed. He just likes looking good. I think people feel better assuming something is being done for them though, like straight men might like the idea that women obsess over what they think. Who knows, but I'd like everyone to cut it out"
"'Maybe lesbians are just straight chilling' Eh, not really. I don't usually bother with makeup because I don't have the patience for it, but I do wish I could lose some weight and I'm insecure about the stretch marks I have on my upper arms, stomach and thighs from when I started taking meds which slowed down my metabolism. So, yeah, I think it's safe to say even lesbians aren't immune to the desire to look and feel attractive."
"Love this! and love your sparkly top, i neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed it <3"
"I think you underestimate my desire for you to choke me"
"Contra, I have to say, you looked beautiful before you had surgery and you look beautiful now. As long as you are doing what makes you happy, I don't think it's important to think any deeper than that (for your own purposes anyway, obviously 'I did it because I like it' would make for a pretty boring video). Also, you've made me very happy that all I plan to have is top surgery and a hysterectomy. I do not want anyone scraping at my bones! Lol"

You sounded like yourself and i was i guess subconsciously worried until you called me a goblin schwein among other things @ 5:00 and then the aerie feeling was shot and murdered."

"I'm sorry you felt the need to have your body hair removed, but its good that you don't have to shave it anymore, its healthier to not have to, whatever way that is, I plan to do the same, but just for looks, but I honestly feel yours was dysphoria, which is odd of a thing to say since you would be the one likely to decide or know that, but based on your desire to get it so strongly and at once, I think its dysphoria, I just plan to go after places that are painful to have hair, places that are painful to shave, places that cause pain when wearing clothes (its just appearance based I swear, I know I'm talking about the pain, but its literal physical pain) and I'm going to start with what is visible when I'm at my most covered, then progressively go based on outfit and such, if my feet were normal human sized, let alone girl sized, I would get hair removal there right after face hair, but that's jot the case and I'll need to make my own shoes... ><"
"Do you really think most non-hyper-feminine women academics are like that because either a) they feel they have to seem 'masculine' to get respect, or b) they want to 'flex' that they're weird?? What about c) they don't like being held to punishingly high standards of presentation and they don't want to waste time on it?"
"I admit the thumb nail freaked me out. I thought someone had assaulted Natalie. Great video! BTW loved the use of Sophie."
"Why can't there be more leftists who are enjoyable to listen to? Seriously, the only reason I listen to people like Chris Ray gun or Sargon or the other IDW is because they are funny and make reasoned points. Which is why i also enjoy watching you.

"Mommy, what happened to Tabby? I'm scared... uwu"
"As a straight cis man I never quite understood the entire trans thing. Like, how do you KNOW for a fact that you were meant to be a woman. Now, I'm pretty sure the surgery helped me see it, but this video marked the first time I caught myself saying 'yeah, that's a chick. That's totally a chick'. The way you edit, the asides, the random humor; it was always THERE, but again, maybe the surgery really brought that out for some reason. I can't see you as a man anymore. You're totally a chick.  And the sheer INSIGHT as to the daily struggle of women is what I came away with. I had some idea, but FUUUUUCK, now I can't imagine the psychological toll that having to fight these demons takes - all because you want to be beautiful. Kinda makes me think about the girl I'm talking to, what she must be going through.  Now I'm not entirely sure how I should be helping her handle those insecurities."

"Natalie you looked beautiful before and you look look beautiful now ❤️ I'm so so happy you're almost fully recovered!!!! I was worried about you mom"
"I finally realized a part of why I was so willing to sit and be lectured to by Contrapoints when I first started watching is that Natalie looks like my older sister. The 'yes momther' stanning never resonated with me b/c my experience is more like watching a sibling play video games I can't beat on my own but instead of video games it's all these issues and academic concepts I haven't successfully grappled with yet. Just like with this video, I now have a familiar experience reintroduced with all this new framework to think about it in..."
"ur my fav"
"18:33 natalie has clearly not peeled off the screen protector on her phone and quite frankly that bothers me for some reason"
"I think in your case they were right to think you're a genius, though. 😍"
"I don't have anything clever or funny to say I just love you"
"Holy moly , You are gorgeous !!!"
"I found out about you because of Daniel Howell.  You talk about serious topics while making them fun?  It’s literally amazing"
"SOPHIE as the intro and the opening overdubbed dialogue like the opening song in “Hi, this is Flume”    Glad you like (actually good) Edm. Subbed"
"What a wonderful world this is, that such transformations are possible <3"

"I feel so sad all the time now"
"Everyone wants to be beautiful, but that requires expressing yourself, and that's a problem for some reason."
"'Yes, I asked all of them.' She didn't ask me. Guess that means I'm not straight. Checkmate heteronormativists."
"I appreciate you trying to pronounce Van Gogh in Dutch, but you should pronounce the first G like a guttural H just like you pronounce the last G.  Cheers from the Netherlands!"

"It’s so awesome that Dr Jordan Peterson is a patron of yours..."
"I think you have a ton of style Contra! You're the one who started the trend of leftist YouTubers using mood lighting for videos. You have your own recognizable aesthetic Contra and don't ever forget that🌸🌸🌸"
"therapy"
"Your nose is adorable!"
"I never feel beautiful, but almost always feel hot"
"I acknowledge that your feelings about not feeling beautiful are very real to you. There is nothing that I can say to make you feel better.  But in my experience as a cis woman, those feelings get better as you become more comfortable with your womanhood. In the past, you have compared transitioning to going through a second puberty. Your feelings expressed in this video remind me of my adolescent self. This does not in ANY WAY diminish those feelings. Just please know that you are truly gorgeous by any standard. your videos give me so much joy. thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything that you do."
"There’s so, so much of this that hit home for me, but the moment that took the air out of my lungs was seeing the spectrum outline between makeup levels and reaction from society.  I’ve been a cis white female in the games industry for about twelve years now, and after my first few years I decided to perform a sort of homegrown study (daily diary over several months) to determine the optimal glam level to avoid negative repercussions at work and reached the EXACT same conclusions you did: Faux natural makeup to avoid being deemed ill, paired with presenting more masculine in dress to avoid accusations of enticement. Be appealing, but not repugnant or “too cocky” (in a producer’s words) I spent way, way too many years of my life mitigating my appearance to satisfy the tiny, feeble egos of my colleagues.  Even now, after deciding to enjoy wearing eyeliner fit to kill a bystander if I feel like it, I’m hyper-aware that presenting as overtly feminine or glam will have any mistake or misstep I make that day as the Smurfette of the office conflated with being vapid, stupid, and unqualified.   I’m lucky enough to work with more evolved colleagues now, but the fear hasn’t gone away. Every time I commit to a cat eye in the morning, because I feel like it goddammit, I look in the mirror knowing I can’t fuck anything up lest that eyeliner become a red flag by which other women are judged by later."
"Demn girl, that eyebrow surgery really did make a difference. I know you already know this but you look so beautiful post-surgery! Also this may cheer you up but the first time I saw one of your videos I thought you were a woman all along until you mentioned you were transgender and I shruged... like... wow if she hadn't told me I wouldn't know (It was your Incels video btw). Keep it up Natalie! I really enjoy your videos and I'm happy you're doing OK."
"If ever you want to stop doing political essays, you should definitely go into ASMR! In fact, why not do both!? You can have more than one YouTube channel."
"Also your neck stands our more, but at certain angles its perfectly feminine (sadly those angles make your face less feminine again, but you certainly have got a really feminine resting face, good for you <3)"
"Prewatch comment: I saw the thumbnail and my instant thought was 'She looks damn elegant.' I really like the composition of that image."
"A lot of points in this video really hit close to home for me. Concerns about aging, wanting to feel pretty, needing validation from strangers while also feeling guilty about needing it. And feeling like I have to choose whether I want to be known for my appearance or my personality. Thanks Natalie for making me feel less alone."
"13:28 as a lesbian, no"
"Really smart references @19:42: 'I guess I'd just rather think about the *aesthetic* rather than the *apocalypse* and that's the *darkness* '  Hilarious incel & leftist references!"
"I love what you've done because you still look like Natalie. You have such a lovely face, and while it's yours to do with as you please, I'll always be happy to see the one I know and heart. It's like you took a pencil and just cleverly changed a line here and there to feminize, but you're still our Natalie.    Also, love that naturally sequined frontal area, UR4 real, I can tell when sequins are fake."
"+1 for Fear and Loathing reference"
"This video is a hot mood.  Also, Lady Foppington seems to be living her best life and I'm very happy for her."
"SIS I LoVe U Why can't I be prettyyyyyyyy like u"
"im LIVING for faceshopping as the intro song"
"That Satie outro 💕"
"I've been meaning to ask and this seemed like the best place to do so. I've noticed when i'm talking about a video of natalie's from before her transition i'm prone to switching to masculine pronouns. should i work on using feminine pronouns in that sort of context or is this considered acceptable?"
"I understand why.  I just think you should try to be happy with how you are.  I know saying that to a trans person is kinda dumb, but when it comes to cosmetic surgery, will it ever be enough?  Will you ever hit the point where you are completely satisfied?  I doubt it.  Please don't get caught in that cycle."
"I  T     M  U  S  T     N  E  E  D  S      B  E     R  E  M  A R K E D"
"I dont think influencers can change society's beauty ideals. I personally believe beauty standards come from what privileges the wealthy have and some biological factors of what a fertile woman looks like. For example being pale in asia is seen as attractive because the wealthy work indoors or not at all and spend their time inside so they do not have a tan. In western culture a tan is desirable as it means who has a tan has time to waste just laying in the sun. Having some extra weight 400 years ago was deemed desirable as it means you have plenty of food to eat and can support offspring well. Now being physically fit is seen as attractive as it means you have ample time and money to spend on food and working out. Societal beauty is a mix of biology and wealth like behaviors."
"I'm a 44 year old heterosexual male that just recently started going to college and I want to be beautiful too.......midlife crisis starting now........."
"M O I S T"
"Omg thank you for taking us on your journey. I’ve just been following your journey for so long, it’s just so rewarding to see how far you’ve come on your journey."
"I think I might have to go see Detective Pikachu"
"The queen has returned."
"Me: Avoide mirrors. Me: I hate how I look, I'm UGLY. (Looking back, I really wasn't ugly. I was actually kinda pretty in high school and am baffled why I thought that.)  Me: Starts T supplements. Now me: Oh... look at that, I look more masculine. I can see differences! I'mma take a good look at that and compare my face every time I pass a mirror and thumbs up myself.   LMAO   Is it bad I still want to be a. little pretty? I want to be more handsome, true, but I still want to be a bit pretty too."
"Gymnopèdie No.1 is my absolute favorite piece of music"
"Anyone else getting Jenna Marbles vibes here, aesthetically?"
"That eyeshadow is some tight praxis natalie"
"Also as someone who is also obsessed with being beautiful, I find this so relatable."
"First time I have ever watched a makeup toturial Also not kidding I thought you made up all those names as you were going."
"I think you're beautiful, Natalie, really beautiful. The kind that I would like to kiss and do all the other things..."
"There's definitely a not-like-other-girls flex somewhere in there. I had Not-Like-Other-Girls Syndrome for a solid six or seven years throughout middle and high school, and honestly? I still kinda do. I'm not out of the woods yet. Now, I blame my bitchy elitism on being an aroace chick in a heavily sex-and-romance-oriented society, and I was also 'the smart kid' and 'the artsy kid'. Flexing on other people made me feel better about myself because I had been marinating in sexist societal pressures since infancy, and I had intellectualist passions to drive my ego and go full 'beauty (and by extension, attracting people for romantic purposes) is for normies, I'M an INTELLECTUAL'. Learning that I felt passion for the things I liked, that I actually LIKED them, helped me come to terms with the idea that hey, maybe this is just something they're passionate about. And as I've grown up, I've obtained additional space in my brain for the nuance underneath these issues, the feelings other people have that I don't, and so on. When you have your self-esteem stomped on by social pressure, shit falls apart and it takes a lot of time to heal."
"You were pretty passing though, and you were beautiful not because you were a girl in a guys body who did some house cleaning and changed the curtains (is that analogy even on the rails??) But because you were a truly beautiful and hot (yes both) human being, and I mean on the shallow not emotional level, and that isn't because you're trans either, that's because you opened windows to what a hot girl really could look like, Adams apple and all, just remember, girls often have many manly traits, often these are subconsciously what people pick up on when seeing them as hot, just look at an average of who is seen as hot, most are more masculine than the less hot girls, people like androgyny, its hot, especially when you are closer to what you present as and identify as, cis or not, BTW I considered you a cis trans girl, and no you don't need to pass for that, just google 'girls with X' and fill in X with whatever bugs you, it helps, now fat girls with small breasts is a thing, and they are seen as hot, but that didn't make me feel much better >< so I'm really bad at taking my own advice, but it at least made me feel valid as a girl, and I think that should go for any trans girl reading this, also trans men, though all the ones I know don't have appearance based dysphoria that much so all I can say is ??men have boobs too?? Idk"
"Shit son, a contra video! Time to not sleep"
"I actually think you were more beautiful before, but that also has a lot to do with the fact that I am not as interested in 'societally standard' beauty in the first place. If it makes you happy and isn't hurting you, I support you as a now longtime fan (two years is long enough to be longtime, right?)"
"When plastic surgery is described that way it sounds really metal"
"In the modern world it is strange to see a woman without her make up.  I appreciate the honesty of it, it feels like I'm being trusted with something.  Thanks for trusting us Natalie.  Also I like your face."
"Wow. Just beautiful! But you were always gorgeous!! 💜"
"16:53 [slams door open] holy SHIT is that a MOTHER FUCKING 'DEATH BECOMES HER' reference"
"Que bueno un video nuevo. Y sobre un temazo. Ojalá todos podamos tener nuestro estilo"
"SOPHIE! :)"
"When I see a contrapoints upload I think two things:  -What woke shit will I learn today?  - Will Natalie make more asmr?"
"The image your detailed description evokes is not fit to be invisioned while eating. I am happy for your victory in this journey, but face peeling sounds like flaying. I am not fit for a phisician's career, and my meal has changed now"
"Glad to know you're still you and feeling better."
"Look, your photo-editing made you feel less beautiful because it makes your eyes go straight to the flaws. So maybe it works in reverse as well: Edit photos to make all the best parts of your appearance worse and try to make it ugly - without releasing the photos to the public of course. Hopefully if you do that for a while, your eyes will go straight to the aspects of your appearance you like the most."
"Missed you 🖤"
"Wow, thank you for making THIS video Nat. As a bio girl i too have ALL these same feelings...it's an unexplainable conundrum! You're so talented 🖤🖤🖤"
"*talks about how: “beauty standards come from privileged people” riding the popularity that comes with the exercising of power provided by unjustified wealth, in an “unequal society”*   me: “oMgAWd, stfu u preppy white b*t^#...”"

"Beauty is a transparency to the divine"
"Half a million sequins.  That is an explosion of color!  I adore that top.  and you rock it like a superstar!"
"I think a large part of your frustration is just downstream from your attempt to remain ideologically pure in favor of social constructionism. The assertion that your desire to be [conventionally beautiful] is simply (or even primarily) a consequence of these [patriarchal western heteronormative pure social constructions] is very likely just adding 'feeling like an idiot drone for buying into this' into the list of what ails you. While I'm not denying outright that there is any element of arbitrary societal influence on what people perceive as beautiful, because that's obviously not true, I do think that this purist leftist position tends to fall apart when it has to contend with any level of objectively unequal or unjust elements of reality. And this criticism of leftist social constructionism is obviously not just limited to conceptions of beauty, it's simply no exception. Look at a lion, or a horse, or a mandarin duck. Most people think those are beautiful animals. Now look at a tapir, a molerat, an anglerfish. You see my point. A revolution doesn't make an anglerfish prettier than a mandarin duck in society's eyes.   That being said, I *do not* think that you're a failure of 'objective' femininity or beauty; you look pretty and you look like a woman. What I'm saying is that I don't just think that your obsession with improving on your vision of yourself is just a consequence of you buying into arbitrary social beauty standards. A revolution isn't just 'not a solution to your problem' because it's 'not feasible,' it's 'not a solution to your problem' because it would make very little difference.   As long as you're still relatively well-off with a good deal of spare time for unhealthy levels of self fixation, with absolutely no real externalized threats or challenges you're actively distracted with overcoming, while having the fundamental baseline dissatisfaction with your objective reality that comes with the territory of transgenderism, I think it's entirely understandable/predictable that you find yourself in this situation. Straight/cis/naturally beautiful/white/rich/healthy people find themselves in these narcissistic death spirals, why shouldn't you? And the fact that you've successfully improved upon your situation with hormones and surgeries in the past just fuels the fire of this fixation, because you have a nagging voice that says 'well what if I just did XYZ minor adjustment' always in the back of your mind.   Anyway, like I said. I think you look good, and you should probably stop with the external changes. The remaining problem is internal, which you've correctly self-diagnosed, I just thought maybe you'd find it helpful to have one less thing to blame for your misfortunes (assuming I've convinced you that your conceptions of beauty are not just socially constructed by Dove in my hastily written YouTube comment, amidst your lifetime conviction to radically leftist positions)."
"No wild exaggeration here, I would love to dress up take you out for a nice meal and introduce you to my parents"
"congrats natalie. 'we live in a society' < 'we exist in a world'"
"hearing the closing song and thinking of sparkly vampires. we really need to take to task the ridiculous beauty standards sparkly vampires set for us!"
"Omg Nathalie put down the Hume!"
"Dear Goddx can we please talk about that sequined fantasy you're wearing, girl?!! Stun."
"Yaaaaassssss! 💜New Contrapoints💜 Excellent videos as always. Congrats on the FFS. You look fantastic, and I hope it helps you feel more comfortable, no matter the reason (dysphoria or beauty)."
"YES SOPHIE LEGENDS SUPPORTING LEGENDS (also you used Gymnopedie No. 1 too and I'm learning how to play that on piano!!!) Love you so much and as a cis guy who has self image issues this struck a very specific, important chord and I love this video SO MUCH"
"FEEEEELLLLLLLLLLSSSSSS"
"Hey guys help me in my bias, so I’m a straight male who priorities physical attractiveness of the opposite gender in this order: Face>Ass>Tits. So I think Natalie is attractive, but knowing she’s transgender makes her unattractive to me.   This isn’t a troll comment, I genuinely think that, so I’d to understand my bias or corrected on my thinking.  I don’t even know if that line of thinking is wrong. I’m learning guys be civil."
"thank GOD we’ve not yet discarded the idea of the chad circumference"
"Trigger Warning: Honesty -   I was directed to your channel when your Incels video was the newest. Halfway through the video you brought up that you transitioned, and it caught me completely by surprise, as you completely passed to my eye.  After watching your entire catalog (and while every creator hates their early stuff, I do very much appreciate that you had left those videos up), I could force myself to see the previous face, but it became harder and harder each video (long since impossible now).  But importantly: I honestly believe that every cis person is clockable. Take any cis person that someone doesn't know, and tell them they are trans, and the person will obviously be trans via hindsight bias.  This can be a big problem for trans people, as a cis person getting incorrectly clocked will just pass it off, as it doesn't happen often, but that could ruin a trans person for a long time. Despite the fact that the cis person does not pass anywhere near as well as the trans person.  I, unfortunately, do not have an answer to that (and performing YouTube psychaitry with no background is a dangerous thing). I am curious if purposefully trying to clock aesthetic cis people could help internalize the wide ranges, such that a part your brain is trying to convince you is masculine is actually well within the feminine range. Or that could go horribly awry and make everything worse D:  As far as makeup goes, some of my friends go from a 7 (no makeup) to an 8 (natural makeup), while some go from a 4 to a 9. (Equivalent to the Show-ers vs Grow-ers?) Of course, in public, people make an effort to pretend to be a Show-er, and as such anyone attempting to rate their pre-makeup is going to be heavily biased against themselves.  With that said, in your Incels video, you were a solid 8+, and only increased since. Of course, despite my warning of honesty earlier, I am sure your brain will try to convince you that I am pandering, but as a wise JaidenAnimations once said: 'It's ok, stop it!'"
"Totally unrelated but you’re so pretty!!"
"I deleted all social media (still go on youtube to channels where representation is more varied) and that helped a lot... but im also doing a masters degree and love to flex on my above-it-all-ness so... theres also that."
"Gosh, that before and after made me scream! Holy shit, you're gorgeous"
"jokes aside, sis. you look good"
"Your hair is the perfect shade of medium/deep blonde. I'm not just saying that because the theme of this video is beauty but because my hair is falling out so I cant dye it and I accidentally dyed it ginger trying to get YOUR COLOR. :( depressing to see your perfect blonde hair with mine falling out and red"
"Finnaalllyyy. Dying of thirst up in here 😍"
"What does Contrapoints and transpeople think of the popularity of dickgirls in hentai?"
"Contra is now in the top of my stanning list"
"Personally as a male I have always been _extremely_ self-conscious about my weight (even at times when I had no reason to be) to the point where something I refuse to go out because I don't want people seeing me like this (like at the moment). Then I feel self-conscious about feeling self-conscious because men aren't suppose to really care that much about their weight, at least not like I do. Then you feel self-conscious about exercising with other people around because people generally see overweight people exercising as humourous. Society is a minefield, however I'm sure it is more like a minefield of hydrogen bombs for trans women given the kind of standards society puts on the female appearance; and that women should be beautiful all while not caring about their appearance.   You are a very pretty lady though. Although I know that personally whenever I get a compliment about anything there's always that voice in the back of my head going 'they're being being nice to avoid conflict or something'."
"Oh, my, this whole thing about feeling sad because I'm conventionally ugly and at the same thing feeling guilty about caring about beauty standards I'm supposed to fight against haunts me since my teenage years, I still haven't found a middle ground and the first time I was able to buy a single item of make-up without feeling guilty was by the age of 28. Seeing people admitting those things makes me feel slightly less guilty."
"ONCE I HEARD FACESHOPPING I KNEW THIS WAS GONNA BE A BANGER"
"Also you're extremely glowingly beautiful and getting more gorgeous all the time. I hope the surgery you got makes you feel that."
"Natalie! You look so much... softer? Idk how to describe it, but you look so good! Very cute!!!!!"
"...or are over 35  Big oof"
"Here it is.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6gt7z-oVZI   No need to thank me."
"You look so ordinary now. I suppose that's what you wanted."
"Dang, you're looking good!"
"omg the surgery turned out great u look so nice !!!! im so happy for u Natalie  !!!!!!!!!!"
"17:09 best part of the video. Also I’ve realised I am definitely in love with you. I guess I’ve known for a little while, but I can’t keep it in any longer. Shall we marry?"
"What a great video. Thank you for teaching us, sister Points."
"immediate SCREAMS at including Sophie's music !!!   love, the hipster nerd who's been really into PC Music lately"
"the section about caring about beauty was pretty amazing, just like, thank you.  'this prejudice that beautified femininity is frivolous' really sums up a lot of experiences i've had in settings that are male-dominated."
"I'll never be a victoria secret angel, but I can't let that hold me back. But if still have issues sometimes. And if I look at myself, pretending I'm someone else, I can write this character better. using aesthetics to really describe myself outwardly."
"Tiqqun time"
"Having an awful day, and then: the chainmail veil is lifted, as are my spirits  #Contraband is life"
"I wasn’t gonna comment on your appearance, because it felt kinda like defeating the whole point (we are doomed to be perceived by others)  but at 17:12 you look a lot like my classmate Madeline. Like, it was uncanny in an instant. Love that Fear and Loathing reference btw"
"Don't go Michael Jackson on us!"
"My nose is so broad. My hair line is terrible and my cheeks are too full. Also I lost a tooth last year that I cant afford the 10k to replace. My kids keep it in perspective. Lol. I made them and they're beautiful. Love what you do, and it helps you love yourself. 😊"
"sadly, the lesbians are not just chilling.  not this one anyway.  'just learn to love yourself' shut up, random gorgeous person on instagram. when i complain about my insecurity and get diet tips, it's hard to love myself. when ads in the mall are nearly identical to the thinspo pictures i used to fuel my eating disorder with, it's damn hard to love myself. even outside my long battle with weight, i care deeply about my hair and skin and constantly feel guilty for doing so.   i work in a corporate, business environment where i am constantly too feminine (suits make me feel hideous) but never feminine enough (i don't think i'm pretty). sometimes i'm too paralyzed by all this shit to get my work done.   i know it's society. i want guys to like me because that's what society tells me is valuable. i'm a lesbian for fuck's sake. but at the same time, i think all this beauty shit is a normal desire.   in conclusion, life is a mess."
"A new upload! Praise the gods. And 'perfect angel, choke me Mommy ' is certainly not an exaggeration"
"That sequin ASMR really did it for me."
"I'm one of those women in academia who doesn't where make up. It's more out of personal discomfort and not feeling any affinity for it. I've always wondered if my lack of affinity for makeup is natural or some expression of genderqueerness. I only ware makeup when doing public speaking. Oddly enough, my sister is a makeup artist."
"19:35 Literally watched this after seeing Detective Pikachu"
"Looks nice on you"
"As a trans lesbian, my commitment to not giving a fuck about societal beauty standards has had me been mistaken for a trans man in the most awkward settings.  This one time I was in a lesbian bar in Tokyo Japan and this dude, who was otherwise very nice, was clearly a trans _man_ chaser and would not stop telling me how beautiful I was.  It was a bizzare time."
"You look like what would happen if Celine Dion and J.K. Rowling had a baby"
"16:19 Oh, look, it's my brain 19:34 🕺🕺🕺"
"I will kill for that  sequins t shirt o dress"
"Hi Natalie, Intellectual exercises (introspection, psychoanalysis etc.) might not directly change our desires, but they can certainly cause us to re-evaluate; to see things that we previously thought were in our best interests, as misguided and stupid. Through associative conditioning, the old desires can thus begin to seem distasteful (i.e., our desires can be indirectly modified). I can provide specific examples if it helps get the point across. Otherwise a great video and an important topic. Regards, Ted"
"For the record, I thought you passed before the surgery!!! And my excitement when I saw this in my notifs was unreal"
"Natalie, in between my day long binge on 94 proof rum with a cool color changing glass, as a 'gift pack' from the ABC store, I just want you to know you've always been beautiful as a person and even as a FTM to begin with prior to this.   I never gave a fuck about your looks. It was enough to be an interesting, hilarious, and frankly attractive person in a way that makes me question myself; to the point I never even thought of it.  But whatever boo, I support you and think you're beautiful regardless of whether or not you support yourself."
"You look amazing. I worry about my appearance a lot, but I don't do anything about it. Depression is a crual mistress. You worry about all the imperfections but do nothing about them."
"You know I never thought about forgiving myself for wanting to be beautiful. That's a good point to bring up too, and the things that make a person want to fit under that particular standard. Thank you for the video."
"This is the best 'my plastic surgery story' video I've ever seen and the soundtrack is bomb"
"14:00 so is Ben Shapiro the crazy uncle that talks to himself and wears a tin foil hat"
"Super fish?"
"We stand one queen!"
"Wait, you mean this WASN’T an ASMR channel the whole time?"
"I just noticed, you look like young celine dion! She was my idol when I was a kid!"
"Like a young Winona Ryder but prettier !"
"I'll be honest, I thought you looked better before your surgery. But I'm also bisexual and like tomboyish and butch women and femme man, also in general a more androgynous look, so maybe I'm not the best one to ask. Also what matters is that you look beautiful to yourself. You don't have to justify looking good to others, you ave to justify it for yourself. For me, it is wanting to look like someone I find good looking. I'm simply too lazy to actually make that happen. I don't know what your inner motivation for looking good is, and you seem like you don't know yourself. But i n my opinion, all you need as a reason is that it satisfies your inner desire for style and beauty. It's like justifying why you want to live in a good looking house. You do it because you like it. The way I see it, vanity is the least superficial reason to want to be beautiful. Wanting to be beautiful for beauty's sake, rather than equation it with other tangentially related qualities."
"This is like an Aydin Paladin video without any of the citations. I'd say with speculation that EVERY possible angle must be considered even into the absurd. Then we can rule out the absurd with real world evidence."
"I preferred lady gaga before her nose job"
"Honestly as a female grad student in a hard science field who loves campy make up and jewelry, it's always in the back of my head that my peers and professors are going to judge me for the 'effort' I put into my appearance (even though I probably spend about the same amount of time in the morning getting ready as everyone else, I'm just more dramatic about it). I once had a physics TA in my undergrad comment after being 5 minutes late to class that I should focus less on my hair and make up and more on making it to class on time. I get that most people couldn't care less but that kind of thing stays with you. Also that 'not like the other girls' thing is sadly very true."
"For what its worth, my husband just looked over my shoulder and asked if I was watching Jenna Marbles."
"Contra you always talk about what I’m thinking about and I’m glad, cause I think everyone is thinking about it. Its good to talk about it!"
"As a trans girl of a third world country that is in the bordeline poverty and only can afford estrogen and spiro I feel pretty much triggered during this whole video  But on the other side Natalie as always amaze me and helps me to look forward to improve myself and looking for means to achieve a ffs in a future"
"“Choke me mommy.” Snort."
"America does need a ContraPoints, so thank you. Also, you look pretty."
"Ms. Points, the video has a terminal case of lag :(("
"I needed you."
"As a lesbian I am chillin...kinda...I also look diseased without makeup tho."
"That cut crease tho <3"
"Love the top"

"You look more generic now... Less character. Your face your choice"
"The effects in the video intro were absolutely amazing. It felt like watching a movie or high budget TV show, not a movie, but then the overall video felt so genuine. The surgery seems more noticeable in profile than when you face the camera. Shaving has become so weird for me (I'm gender fluid). For months, I decided not to shave because I noticed less was growing back and I wanted to let it grow back and look less patchy. Then, after months of loving my body and the time freed up by not shaving, I started thinking I needed to shave and questioning myself when I put on a perfectly fitting sleeveless dress in a thrift store. I decided not to buy the dress since it made me question myself for the sake of beauty standards (the idea that you cannot wear a dress with armpit hair). Love the supporting corporations part. The criticism discussion was so smart and thought out."
"I need that top omg"
"Thanks, Nat. I won't be having FFS any time soon. Maybe get rid of the acne scars. You look gorgious, but you started out looking pretty good.  Hey, Girl what do you do for your voice?"
"Is this a dude"
"As someone (a cis man) who has had similar surgeries of skull, I can attest that feeling like shit including a spout of depression isn't that strange.   After finishing the video: The chin will stay numb for about year. But I still find myself drooling and only noticing it when starts going down my neck. It sucks. BUT WHO CARES! I don't look like some ape man anymore! I can actually chew things! YAY! Chewing things!"
"Honestly the change you have had done is so amazing and so unclockable! Hell, I think the surgery has been good for you, it might be perception, but you cracked quite a few jokes that make me think you are happier now than you were before.   There is something that you brought up that I think worries me. My best friend is obsessed with filters on all her photos. Its nearly impossible to get her to take a photo where she isn't using filters to lighten her skin and such. As her friend I think she is beautiful just as she is, but I am worried that maybe this idea of editing out imperfections is having a negative effect on her self esteem or her own perception. Is there some way I am able to help her understand?"
"Miss Wynn,  We could have a drawn out conversation about fate, in which I mention how this video was uploaded 6 days before I am to get FFS, and that it has given me the opportunity to hear a voice of representation, of well-educated middle-class transness that isn't coming from my own mouth. But instead of fate, I think it is a lot more interesting to discuss choices.   I'm a rising sophomore at an 'elite' university, and this past semester I ruminated over the fact of my peers receiving cushy grants and stipends to travel the world, participate in prestigious internships, fulfilling community service etc., while I had to answer their earnest inquiries into my summer plans with 'welllllll um yeah no thats so cool! and Im getting, like, plastic surgery. :)' Fortunately, rumination is a great means to the end of self acceptance, I've found, ironically enough.  I've been made to question why 'millimeters of bone,' as you put it, are taking priority over world travel and cultural enrichment. And the truth is, it might honestly be a bad decision. But ultimately, its just that, a decision. Who is to say that this surgery would make me feel any more or less close to a more pure experience of the beauty of life than, say, backpacking through the alps with a $5k grant to spend on nice chocolate and Ubers to and from tinder dates? Life is about experiencing, and thats what I'll be doing this summer. I'll be experiencing surgery, pain killers, swelling, anesthesia, post-op depression, loving concern from friends and family etc. I'm pushing the boundaries of what constitutes an appropriate use of an oh so precious summer just as my friend who is being paid to bartend in Berlin and blog about it is.  AS A TRANS WOMAN I have faced immense pressure to conform to beauty standards, which has contributed to mental and physical health threats that most others do not experience to the same degree. I can acknowledge that FFS won't put me any more onto the path of self acceptance than throwing away my mirrors or scoffing at less educated or less privileged transpeople in a futile attempt to inflate my own sense of worth will. Do I feel proud about my decision. No. Really, I don't feel anything. I have one life, I might as well pursue 'beauty.' Who is going to stop me, and, more importantly, why does it matter?  Thank you for editing down the last few contemplative months, in which my feelings of guilt, privilege, fear, vapidity, and eager excitement have brewed into a thoroughly opaque lack of feeling, into a 30 minute video that I somehow do not feel has in any way pandered to the majority-cisgender demographic of your audience. Representation matters, especially when that representation is the very thing tackling the existentialist, eurocentrically standardized (I know the wording on that one was a reach), capitalist prologue to the reconstruction of my skull. For when hamlet held up that skull in that play thingy written by that one guy, did he not say something along the lines of 'to be be beautiful, or to ignore my dread at looking at a candid pic in profile, that is the question.'  Claire"
"So you went for something other than the nearly clone-like Celine Dion features you had... Really? Was that necessary? I mean, you look more like her 80's look, but... Really?"
"One thing i forgot to mention in my other comment: I started doing skincare instead of makeup and I like it a lot because it kind of scratches that vanity itch but feels better to me on my face than makeup. When i started, i came into the bedroom the first night and asked my husband how I looked. He said 'wet'. So there's that."

"wow, so many feels. As an AFAB genderqueer enby who leans towards the masc/androgynous look, I have thought A LOT about beauty vs style. I used to think I was just an ugly woman, or that I was just bad at being a woman, but since i have a lot of aesthetic appreciation for traditionally femme things (nails, makeup, sparkles, floral, etc.), I must just be not trying hard enough. So I tried. I leaned in, I bought (and stole, thanks capitalism) makeup, I wore dresses that required push up bras and tights, I curled and straightened and teased and sprayed my hair (even though I've always had a sensory issue with having product in my hair). I liked what I saw and I thought that was worth it. But it became a thing that I HAD to do, even to go to the store, and as soon as I was sure I didn't have to go out again, I would take it off.  Around that time I had two AFAB friends who came out as nonbinary and started experimenting with various nontraditional styles. One took testosterone, stopped wearing makeup, and started wearing more masc clothes. another started binding and later got top surgery, but continued to play with makeup and wear sparkles and paint their nails. I was FASCINATED. I became *THE BEST* ally I could be, lurking in groups, reading articles, defending nonbinary people at every step. Seperately to that but sort of concurrently, the pain I had been feeling in my feet and knees for years finally became unbearable and I stopped trying to dress up and go out. I hobbled down the stairs each morning and wore pajamas or leggings and t shirts most of the time. I stopped wearing my underwire bra because it seemed like there was no point if I wasn't going to go all the way and I had always hated it anyway. My bike broke and I didn't replace it the next summer. I was pretty miserable and gained a lot of weight (I've always been heavy, but had been able to find looks i thought worked on me, but this was the heaviest I've ever been and I didn't like the way I looked at all). I was convinced by family to see a foot doctor and was given custom orthotics. I had been wearing knock off doc marten boots or ballet flat style shoes for years and I had to buy what i thought were ugly athletic shoes (I was like 'im not an athlete, i look like a poser). But i tried to wear them every day around the house and i started to feel relief. I could finally go for walks again. I started riding a bike again. I was so happy to be independent again, I stopped thinking about how i looked to other people and started dressing for comfort and practicality. I wore a lot of cut offs and my husband's hand-me-down t shirts and button ups, and I started to experience something I had never felt before. I felt like I could look good and not feel like I was wearing a costume. That's when I came out, first as demigirl, then genderfluid, then finally genderqueer, which is how i've been identifying for a couple years now. I now feel more comfortable mixing in elements of femininity without having to 'put on a woman costume'. Instead of seeing my wide jaw and square face as something that made me look ugly, I now kind of appreciate them in a different way. I look at them as cute from a masc perspective instead of as signs i'm just an ugly woman. *I'm NOT saying trans/nonbinary folks should just accept their faces the way they are. If contouring or FFS is what you want to do, go for it. I just find it so interesting that features that are gendered (jaw width, forehead size) can be either beautiful or ugly depending on what look you're going for.  I'm glad you were able to access a surgery that you wanted and that you're happy with the results. I doubt you'll read this far, but if you do, for what it's worth, I find you very attractive. I do happen to be a pansexual enby who finds masculinity and femininity attractive, and who thinks you were pretty hot before your transition, and who has a specific thing for tall bossy women, so take that as you will. But fandom and exaggeration aside, I think you are a very pretty woman, and I'm glad you're still making these videos."

"Also not to be the person who double comments but I feel this a lot. I met someone who was surprised that I was trans recently, he said “the more you know.” I got confused when my Uber driver was surprised that I was gay because I thought was too feminine enough in looks and mannerisms  to pass in general. I thought my voice was too effeminate to be “straight passing.” I look at the bodies of (presumably) cis men who are my height and close to my weight, who have a bone structure similar to mine and they read ‘male.’ I look at myself and I think “female,” despite the fact that I haven’t been clocked in a while. But that’s not what it is... it’s not that I don’t think I look like a man (I don’t, but other people think I do) it’s that I don’t think I look like the man that I could have looked like. I can say with an amount of certainty that if I had been born cis, or gotten puberty blockers if I was faster to realizing that I was trans, and had a better family, I would look different. I would look more like the person that I think I’m supposed to look like. A person that at this point is unattainable even with surgery. It’s rough, but it’s a reality that a lot of us have to face, and self acceptance is it difficult but necessary Road..."

"I'm only 18.5 minutes in, but as a cis woman with likely body dysmorphia, history of disordered eating, family abuse regarding weight and appearance, I have thoughts. This is something I've spent lots of time (and therapy) reflecting on. My last therapist would ask me, often, why I want to be pretty. I don't even know. But what I do know, and perhaps you address it later in the video, is that I don't necessarily think that fans are liars and haters just want to hurt you, I think it's also that when we like people, we see them as more attractive, not just liking attractive people. I have even found myself rationalizing my personality, in darker questioning moments - am I a nice person simply bc it's one of the only ways I can get other people to think i'm pretty? So I think people who like you, who appreciate your content and personality, literally see a different person than those who don't. If the most artistically talented among us were to render your image, there would be different outcomes. I've even found this with celebrities that I may have not found attractive at first, but learned something of their personality and later saw them as more attractive, and vice versa. Like I said, this is something I've been thinking about at length for probably 20 years, or more, and it's become only more complicated as I now have an elementary age daughter who looks more than a little like me. That is a whole new challenge. So I appreciate this video, I always appreciate your view point and observations."

I can only wish you the best in the pursuit of beauty. I say you have achieved it several times over but that means little, I know. If you were a personal friend of mine I'd shake you by the shoulders and demand that you see your own objective beauty in the mirror and not the face of perpetual defeat that your mind tells you to see.  Anyway, I'm drunk and Scottish plus whatever other influences are clouding my judgement as I lay in bed thinking about how much I love everyone and everything.

It didn't start out as a conscious choice, it's just something I didn't realize was happening at that point when we were all going through puberty, so I totally missed the boat and now at age 38 I feel like I would look like a clown if I tried to put makeup on. I'm horribly ashamed of my ignorance of this basic life skill, yet utterly intimidated when I think about maybe trying to learn. I do a TON of brainwashing myself into thinking my looks don't matter, even though they do, and my life would probably be different, better even, if I'd just swallow my pride and get with the program."

Although I do not deal with gender dysphoria, I have a mild (mild since it was addressed and treated with therapy) case of Body dysmorphia. It stems from different sources or problems that I know are potentially exaggerated and I so wish I could vanish them.  But even after having spent time and money for the issues to be treated, I still don't really feel I'll finally get to love myself and think my aesthetic is ideal or acceptable.   The issue no longer causes me pain, but its ongoing existence is a rather annoying burden.    Beauty is my curse for I aim to be like the individuals that exude confidence and possibly wake up in the morning feeling that they can take a picture without thinking they need to fix their entire face.  And although I have don't have reason to complain, because I'm kinda like above average, I feel way more trapped because, well, I have standards for myself and they ought to be met one day. Please God.    Anyway, I want to say thank you for having made this video.  One of the fabulous branches of philosophy I enjoy the most is aesthetics. Understanding beauty under different lenses, be it artistic, social, evolutionary, you name it.. is eye opening and it's oddly intoxicating.   I wish for you to know that, according to my eye, you look wonderful and the surgery simply brings a refreshing and youthful look to your face. I'm happy for you.   Props for the video, and let's keep compensating by being style icons as well <3"
"I'm happy for you Natalie! Sending you good vibes."
"Thing is, so many people assume just because you’re smart you don’t also have a desire to look pretty. Yes bitch, I can talk about global warming and how time is entropy while putting on my foundation it doesn’t matter. For me beauty is always something I do for myself, when I look good I feel good and when I feel good I do good, which is why when I have to study for a subject I like to wear an outfit I would wear to go out.  However, there’s something that really pisses me off and that’s when people start talking about things they can’t control such as stretch marks and cellulite (and also weight gain, women tend to gain weight when on their periods and lose if after). For me beauty is for ME and me only, it’s a private thing, so it really bothers me when people try to publicize it. My friends talking about how fat they are bothers be because it never bothered me before until I was constantly surrounded by people who said that stuff. What I ate and how I looked was a personal experience and suddenly everyone around me was talking about it and it bothered me because they kept feeding into this idea that to be beautiful you have to have big eyes, be tall and have a large bust.  And okay, fair enough, you can talk about your insecurities but maybe people should think more before criticizing themselves because there’s always going to be a younger more impressionable person listening.  And besides, everyone dies. No ones going to remember the time you forgot to shave, everyone’s too insecure about themselves to be thinking about you. You have one body, and one body only, you should be content with what you have. It’s totally fine to try and improve it, you should do whatever makes you feel happy! But the key thing is it should be for YOU and not because society told you that big noses are a no no or that your jaw isn’t sharp enough."

"Fantastic video. I think my own interest in art is pretty heavily rooted in my own insecurities about my appearance. I've always kind of felt that I look like shit and the only way I'd ever be associated with anything beautiful was to create it as a work external to my own person. Anyway, I can't wait make many paintings of your updated look."
"You look great! I'm glad your surgery went well."
"Natalie can't get herself to look ugly, not even to prove a point."
"The SOPHIE track is an inspired choice ❤️"
"You look like Jenna Marbles here"
"21:36 Contra: 'I'M so FUCKing WET right now'  I. DIED. I love you so much babe omg 😂😘"
"thx for making content, many lawls had by me. I can relate."
"I don’t know if you get complimented on this a lot, but damn Natalie, you’re hilarious. And smart, duh. This script was gold. Thanks for another great video :)"
"ASMaRe you gonna make an asmr video? Cause you should definitely do that... for like an hour or five..."
"As someone with an eating disorder and body dysmorphia I really feel the message of this video. It’s hard having a disease which makes me obsessed with my own body and not feel vain and  ashamed that I can’t just love the white, cis, abled and privileged body that I do have."
"Hey thats how lots of women feels all the time: u should be realy beautiful or nobody is gonna ever love you (and in a even deep level than just romantic), but care about it makes you stupid and superficial. Sometimes it feels like there no way out, and piss me off because i know its was costructed to make womem always feel bad about their apperance and intelect in a fucking paradoxical combo (since the same people tell us this both things)"
"Thanks, I needed this ❤"
"holy shit that intro"
"I like how in the conclusion of the video you literally addressed all the nuances I had with it previously. I felt personally attacked and I loved it."
"Natalie, thank you for remembering to mention disability. It means so much"
"I’ve been craving a new video, thank u bb"
"14:20 “What every gamer thinks about makeup” 💀😂  fuck that made me laugh so hard when I realized"
"IT MUST NEEDS BE REMARKED"
"I've been watching too much Lindsay Ellis, because when you said you 'Glisten', I immediately expected a 'See how I glitter!' Clip to be thrown in.   P.S. When can you collaborate with her again?"
"as a lesbian, i can confirm that i am straight chillin."
"You look good 😍"
"You are very hot and I'm definetly attracked to you. Btw not a fan, just passing by    Beijos molhados do Brasil s2"
"God. We really do live in a society."
"We're driven to look good by biology, but what is considered good looking can change depending on the time and culture. There are some underlying similarities / constants of course, such as the fact that most people prefer someone who isn't too skinny or too fat, or has terrible skin or hair and so on. I don't think you should beat yourself up over wanting to look good, because that's inevitable, just like how Christians beat themselves up for wanting to have sex outside of wedlock for example. Natural desires are powerful things, and can only be managed, not eliminated."
"You look very  nice today"
"You want to be beautiful? I think you're pretty damned close!"
"Love the more loose and playful tone of this video!! Keep it up Natalie!"
"It's hard to be a six sounds like an amazing hashtag."
"It sounds like a really exhausting month. Thank you for making this video, and I hope you can find the strength to be kind to yourself more often."
"My beautiful Contra, I loved this video. Pure art."
"5 seconds in and i hear SOPHIE. ITS A WINNER EVERYONE"
"god the way the plastic surgery is described sends shudders down my spine, its amazing you had the courage do go through with it! love your work Contra!"
"New contrapoints day!!!"
"oh we stan a vulnerable moment!"
"Oh... I Stan. We Stan. I Stan."
"Shout-outs to the Gymnopedie arrangement"
"Look, you have made very deep and profound observations in this video, but allow me from the bottom of my shallow heart congratulate you and your shallow attempt to look beautiful, because you look be-a-u-ti-fuulll! And no, I don't want to be untoned in my face, that's why I layer it seven fucking times every day."
"It’d be fuckin hard watching your face in editing when seeing my own face in the mirror is enough for me. That being said, you’re gorgeous, really. Some form of flattery from a transbian, I know but kinda makes me keen for FFS despite being sort of okay with how I look. It’s pretty raw and recent, but I think my thinking about myself reset after a suicide attempt and a short ICU stay; I feel like Kelsey first rather than the boy I started as.  Hopefully and obviously anyone else’s realisation doesn’t come from such a place of finality. Anyway, much love to the only trans YouTuber I’m subbed to xo, we do need a ContraPoints more than any impersonator"
"I would listen to an hour of just the nails on sequins"
"What was the point of making this video? I mean apart from getting attention? and doing some posturing? Your intellectual snobbery, smugness, nihilism and sarcasm- it's the lowest emotional currency in the world of today, next to open aggression and hatred. Good luck making more overproduced, a e s t h e t I c a l videos filled with mental poison, dishonesty and narcissism."
"You look great! You looked great before, but my opinion doesn’t matter, so I hope you’ve reach that level of beauty you desire."
"You look gorgeous! You still look like the smart women you are, yet slightly more smart. Love you, Natalie."
"agender lesbian. fairly chilling, but viewing myself from an outside gaze. resisting makeup. not shaving (cause i see that as womanly) but wanting to be attractive and wanted. but not too wanted. more concerned with if sOcIEty sees me as beautiful. because it means I'm worth more. a standard of, even when im not trying, im beautiful (wanted). judgemental of highly feminine beauty practices because I see that as being pushed on me"
"Girl, some of those skincare products you're using contain irritants that might actually make your skin worse!! There are 2 fantastic dermatologists on here that I'd recommend to anyone interested in skincare: Dr. Dray and Dr. Sam Bunting.    Some of their advice is disappointingly practical, but I have a skin condition, and I've literally never had nice skin until I started taking their advice."

"Anyone got links to the refinery 21 doc and the vid about jailhouse makeup? I would really like to watch that stuff but I don’t know what to search"
"Dear Natalie,  you need to be beautiful for the after revolution ball room dance.  So be as beautiful as you can impossibly be and train your steps. After all a revolution without music and dance is not a revolution worth doing."
"SOPHIE in a contravideo? pubic wig      snatched"
"dairy queen sucks"
"I'm trans masc but I've been saying this same thing for awhile. What is dysphoria and what is not? Because a lot of short cis men feel the same way I do about my height. So... Is that dysphoria or just... I mean it's so bundled in there, like she said."
"proof that these arent 'constructs' if you are intellectually disagree with it, but emotionally agree with it."
"Minecraft music"
"Natalie, I recently rewatched Legally Blonde expecting a good ol' cheesy 90's meaningless chick flick and my mind was fucking BLOWN when I realized that the message of the movie very much parallels some of the issues you talk about here. People don't take Elle Woods seriously because she embraces all of the 'vain' things that people associate with superfluous femininity, and this makes everyone around her automatically assume that she's less intelligent. It's also very empowering because she refuses to give in to the 'not like other girls' pressure. Highly recommend giving it a second look, I found it surprisingly inspiring. Also PUT ON FUCKING SUNSCREEN CMON ITS THE NUMBER ONE THING YOU CAN DO TO PREVENT AGING sorry for yelling but it's important ok I love you baaiiiiii"
"My god I never realized how much we need a video with you and Jeffree. or James. Or both? Fuck it, both."
"Its always about the skulls huh"
"I'm doing a project next year. It's to make it so we can share our view of the internet. Not just share, but abstractly alter it. Kinda like casting a spell with essences of other people's views. Essentially it's their Google bubble, their YouTube suggestions, their FB feed.   I want to see what others see and have others see things from different points of view, step out of their shoes. It's amazing how much is hidden to us by our previous behavior, attitudes.   Partly hoping this will get ignored. Partly hoping someone will offer to help."
"You look great. I’ll fight anyone who says you don’t."
"This video has one amazing mouth feel"
"16:22 same"
"You're more than pretty, you're amazing. And you are the beauty guru the Internet needs."
"As the grad student who doesn’t wear makeup it is absolutely not a “flex”. I fully recognize that makeup is a skill that I haven’t put the work in to possess and I have a lot of friends that use it as artistic expression. It’s also not because of societal expectations, I feel a lot of social pressure to spend time and money on makeup and that as a women I *have to* wear it to be taken seriously in certain social situations. Sometimes not wearing makeup despite comments, and judgements about “professionalism” around me is to show that my face is good enough and professional enough the way it is.   But you’re right that there’s no real way to win because women with lots of makeup get judged just as much. And yours looks absolutely amazing btw."
"Hi Natalie! Hope you have a great day! Hugs from Ohio"
"I'm a straight cis woman, and learned more about skincare from this video than I have from Cosmo or some Sephora tutorial. I want to be you when I grow up!"
"If it hadn't been mentioned I wouldn't have been able to tell it was surgery. You look amazing and it's great that you're feeling more comfortable with your image.  EDIT: Now I actually watched the whole video lmao. The presentation is fucking majestic, as usual.  I didn't actually expect to be able to relate to as many of the points as I did, and it's pretty cool that you mentioned how the physical change did little to change the psychology of your self image/perception as a whole. Somehow it seems obvious and underreported at the same time."
"'beautified femininity = frivolous' replace 'beautiful' with 'normative' and then you've got it.  my feminine hairy armpits are beautiful. as much as man's are. it's up for you to try and see it."
"As a man****"
"You look stunning!!!!!"
"FACESHOPPING!"
"I mean, you've absolutely succeeded at creating the taste for your incredible style. Thank you for putting that thought out there, because I have never been able to control my self hatred in terms of beauty. Maybe style is the solution!"
"Natalie, I’m an occasional visitor. The beauty of your mind hasn’t been diminished, and it’s also not been diminished by your desire to change your appearance, however subtly.  I don’t know what other people have told you, but I always thought you were beautiful – especially vis-à-vis the words coming out of your mouth.  But to be honest, I’ve always been attracted to the Middle East phenotype, which includes the arched nose. And as far as your eyes – perfect. Don’t ever touch those (unless you have, which I didn’t notice).  Not everyone wants to achieve Western norms. I don’t have a problem with you wanting to, but you’ve always been beautiful, and still are.  P.S. I ran acrost your site for the first time at the Current Affairs website. Give ‘em props.  Leroy"
"Natalie, would your friend Theryn now say you have a neotenous face? :-)"
"I liled the video until about minute 25. Just putting it out there that the whole reacharound of 'I can only change what I desire by changing society' sounds pathological, specially when 'my desires are rooted in things I don't fully understand' is a much simpler explanation.  Also I think that there's a funny point to be made that gamers are some of the people that should understand makeup better because there's a whole frenzy in that market right now about cosmetic items. And you're certainly not buying them to sexually attract other players, and it's definitely not all about bragging rights. Just a fun paralel that maybe someone smarter than me could implement into something."
"Natalie saying “raised as a middle class white boy” was the weirdest thing for me to hear. Doesn’t fit her look at all, before she said that I always imagined child Natalie to be a girl. Even after seeing her old content. Natalie is a woman don’t @ me"

"thank you for showing SOPHIE to your audience !"
"ContraPoints fans have an average IQ of 85."

"WORDSWORTH IS HIS NAME?!"
"This perasocial relationship has got me feeling disheartened. I promise I've never exaggerated my attraction for you. Please believe me, my majesty"
"Maybe it's because I'm young and dont have to worry about social standards as much as an adult, but I feel a lot more chill with my makeup than I used to. I dont bother with foundation or contour or anything. I wear pink or coral lip tint and shimmery or glittery eyeshadow. Those are even probably based off constructs like you said but... I know that enough. I like the glitter and such. It's enough for me. (Also, on bone structure... honestly it's too scary for me to even consider lol. I just make sure to never use any face editor so I never had to face it lol)"
"the thing I don't understand about trans people is you can not will your body to become female  it must be faked through surgery why just not accept the way you were born . this type of stuff is only possible in the western world where people like you are so privileged they have time to waste on if they look feminine or not .first world problems lol"
"Choke me mommy"
"I remember this turning point as a child when we had an assembly in which the presenter reframed being self-conscious (about one's appearance) as self-absorbed. I knew I was self-conscious, but I couldn't stand the idea of being self-absorbed, so I trained myself to care less about modifying my appearance to be beautiful. Hope that reframing helps for others. Also psychedelics, entheogens, watching less mainstream TV and not living in LA!"
"Am a lesbian worrying that I'll never be able to attract someone as hot as ContraPoints Not straight chillin Intimidated by straight-ish trans women who can do better makeup than I ever will *mascara runs*"
"this came out ON MY BIRTHDAY! thank you almighty contrapoints for the best 18th birthday present ever"
"Loved the music in this one! Erik Satie is my fav."
"Awesome vid"
"I think love is much more important than beauty and the two are only tangentially related"
"Ayyy, that Faceshopping by Sophie at the intro psyched me up for another awesome video."
"Natalie is back my depression is gone my crops are watered and my ass is ready"
"Watching this reminds of why I never watch your videos, you're such a woman"
"30 seconds in, and the aesthetic/editing of this is jaw-dropping. And jaw-shaving. It's amazing that you look so similar, just more like yourself. It's not about becoming a different person. It's about becoming, in whatever way matters to you, the person that you are."
"Gay or gamer. Whats the difference"
"You rock and congrants to your 600k... Well 599k but whatever. It will get there in a few hours or days."
"I often avoid your videos for a while before finally watching them, even tho I always enjoy them, because every time you dump so much raw, deeply honest, and true shit on me I'm too disoriented to deal anything else all night. You don't shy away from any corner of a thought. You don't give into the temptation to create a #woke image of yourself to present to other people, like every single one of us feel the urge to do. Because that sacrifices piece of the conversation. And you know how much criticism thats going to get you, but if everything else hasn't stopped you already, why should a little more criticism? Theres a lot of faces with bone structure that ring a dopamine bell in my head every time. And thats great. But I feel less helpless when your face changes the shape of something in my mind. When you describe the struggle of a thought I've tried to detangle for years as if its plain as day to you. And when you talk, it is. Its decadently cathartic to see these things laid out so carefully, no thought or question of mine goes unanswered. Thanks a ton for all that. I spent the full 30 minutes staring at your cheekbones btws, I like em. The new chin really makes them pop elegantly."
"You're so beautiful Natalie 😊😊😊"
"You are fucking beautiful!"
"YAAAASSSSSS I've been waiting for a new video for weeks. I love the editing, girl! You're killin the YouTube videos!"
"literally not 10 minutes before i opened this app and saw you uploaded, i was debating with myself about whether or not my beef with my face was dysphoria or generalized dissatisfaction with my new, lower spot in the beauty hierarchy. i still don't know the answer after watching this but i am going to order some new shoes now in the misguided hope that some new material possessions will soothe my aching soul"
"You are beautiful, and so is this video."
"your videos are works of art fr, and you are sooooo beautiful"
"Well, your brain will always be beautiful, to me."
"after that intro I fully expected this video to be a recipe for gluten-free cookies"
"Whoah Natalie, save some Chads for the rest of us"
"I'm a twenty year old trans girl. 8 months on hrt and very ground down by life. Sometimes I look st myself and see beauty and power (or at least the suggestion of it)  But more oft than not I see an obvious boy, a horrorshow. I'm bi, I'm comfortable being butch or femme, I'm a Socialist and a feminist. But its not enough. What is?  I want ffs and voice surgery. It looks like I'm going to have to work for three years as an Ubereats courier to afford that.  Even more difficult is the fight against my inner demons. Friends, communities, acceptance, family. So much, so hard. I want to rest but my mind likes to eat itself.  I hope things get easier, I hope I find a way to tolerate being around people without alcohol. I hope I find some strength of my own.  I suppose hope isn't enough. Gotta grab it and all that. Its that sort of world.  Lets try and make a different kind of world."
"I definitely want top surgery to alleviate dysphoria but it really is for aesthetics as well. Not only do I want my chest to be flat; I want it to look good because I want to feel handsome. And I personally I'm ok with that."
"Sure, but your class privilege is the only reason why you're allowed to spend this amount of time and money on transitioning.  The rest of us have forty hour work weeks, safety concerns, housing and employment discrimination...  Yeah, great job Natalie."
"Isnt aesthetic a form of philosophy? Just write your thesis on beauty and call it a day"
"why is a cis woman talking about trans stuff"
"My ContraPoints sense was tingling. Then I get on and see you’ve posted. You look AMAZING holy cow!"
"'do i want to atract women? i guess, i don't really think about it... i mean, isn't it safer to just secretly fall in love with them while quietly dying inside' nathalie stop attacking me like that please i beg you"
"Why isn't anyone talking about mouth feel?"
"Seems legit."
"The only thing worst than the energy we loose obsessing about beauty is the guilty feeling that comes after those 10 minutes starring at our flaws in the mirror. Loved the points you made in the video as always ❤️"
"I'm sad now"
"I love you Natalie"
"I got in the habit of complimenting and then increasingly noticing effort after reading 'Growth Mindset Theory' and working in schools that adopted growth mindset principles. This has bled into my personal life and it is instinctual for me to compliment complex eye makeup instead of eye color and other hard to modify physical characteristics. Seeing this video helps me reframe that as complimenting style over beauty, and I love that!"
"Your videos are like an informative stroke. I learn a lot, but it comes at a cost."
"Natalie, you somehow always manage to upload when I'm having a rough day, and seeing a new video from you always cheers me up ♥"
"There are probably tons of lesbians already telling you we aren't chilling, but here's another one! I worry that my bone structure makes me look like an alien and that the fact I don't wear makeup and have white skin and a skinny body makes me look diseased.  Style however IS how I try to cope with this! I wear cool stuff that makes me happy and I have some sweet moves and live my own unique self and then I just feel like the way my body looks is so fitting to it all that it actually makes me VERY beautiful!   So yeah really loved your video, I hope people can start trying to change society and then maybe I'll feel like I fit in and not blame the length of my fingers for not having friends <3"
"As soon as SOPHIE kicked in I knew this was gonna be a gem"
"Natalie kinda looks like a young Tati. Objectively, Tati is a very good looking woman. 😄"
"@ 10:44 contra are you ok sweetie"
"10:45 That ADD mood"
"Its amazing. You’re beautiful yet even you still feel like you aren’t half the time. I feel that way too. What is that? Why is that? Our brains are our worst enemies.   For what it’s worth I genuinely think your beautiful. Even before surgery. But I’m glad you were able to do something that makes you feel better about yourself.   Keep being a badass."
"'Maybe lesbians are just chillin' while everyone else has just straight up lost their minds' I laughed so hard."
"I was on the fence about getting FFS beyond removing my Eve's apple, but after seeing how you somehow got more pretty, I'm sold"
"I've been waiting for this 😍😍😍😍"
"As a (hopefully slightly less than absolute) Stupid Old White Man, I am constantly & joyfully ensorcelled by your incandescent mercuriality. Thank you for being such a deliciously theatrical communicator for that amorphous share of the human condition I do not know & wisening my ass up!"
"You look gorgeous 😍"
"Your next video should be about truscum, if you haven't tackled that can of worms yet."
"You looked beautiful before & you look beautiful now. But honestly!!!!! YOUR WORDS!! THESE VIDEOS!!!! wow i stan so hard. love this channel"
"Love Erik Satie, Great sound track."
"Is personality better than beauty because overthinking one's appearance prevents social growth on a personal level and by extension being a better person?"
"You look beautiful!"
"So if I skip the flattery will you choke me?"
"My left ear really enjoyed the intro song."
"i could never thank you enough for including the biological sequin asmr"
"Got you girl. I wish you the best for your 'beauty' journey! My cis-girl ass developed major facial dysmorphia in my early teens (imagine a 13 year-old photoshopping her face bEfOrE iT wAs CoOL) and it took me *over a decade* to reach a point where I wouldn't change a thing about my bone structure! Even now I still have adult acne and contemplate if I should give up sanity and health for Accutane-induced clear skin 🙄 I'm confident even with acne, but imagine clear skin! Whoooooaaaaa"
"16:26 yes perfection"

"Showed clip to my mom ( she has no idea who you are) says you look pretty."
"That intro is so sick holy shit"
"'honestly, if all men died tomorrow -- f' same sis"
"Here's another dopamine hit for your brain: I think you look gorgeous. You did before as well. I'm so glad the surgeon didn't remove your great sense of humor while he was in there rummaging around... By the way, so glad you included disabled people in your talk. If society found disabled people beautiful more often, it might feel a little better sitting in a wheelchair. I do think I pull it off though. Serving looks on wheels! Thanks for another great video!"
"Damn you’re stressed"
"Girl you look drop dead gorgeous but im dissapointed there is no laser eyes or some robotic arms"
"This was the perfect (and only) occasion and context for SOPHIE's song"
"Love love everything you make!!"
"choke me mommy 😩😩👏"
"Me: ooo Contra posted a new video I hope the intro is very dramatic and extra Contra: hold my beer"
"27:03 YES! Thank You Natalie! 🌸❤️⭐️🌈 I will never ever, I have never ever, been good enough for gay porn, but at least, yes! I have my own style.  Style lasts longer. And costs little.  Thanks ever so much! I learned something today."
"This was a great video, thanks Natalie. As a non-binary person, I struggle a lot with how to present my most 'attractive' self to the world. The way people interpret my gender based on my appearance is something I think about a lot. I used to love wearing earrings, but now I feel that it reads too feminine so I never wear them any more. The concept of a curated style as a response to the pressure of social beauty standards seems to wrap up the issue neatly. Even if I can't conform to what I think others will find beautiful, I feel encouraged to pursue my sense of style as a genuine representation of what I find visually attractive, no matter how it correlates to gendered beauty standards"
"Is this the first video out of character? Also what's the deal with Dairy Queen?"
"S T O Y T I M E"
"Love the use of Faceshopping at the beginning, definitely the best music video of last year"
"In the past you made fun of 'Nazis' and 'Incels' about their obsession with skull shape.  I hope you now have more empathy with them about 'biological determinism' and a 'spiritual genetic ideology'"
"6.5 for most guys. Tranny chasers you are probably like a 9."
"I love Sophie"
"There are two main types of feminine beauty. The first relates to features that appeal to men who are attracted to signs of child-bearing. This explains the popular over exaggerated hour-glass figure on instagram models. This kind of beauty evolved around reproduction.  The second and more powerful type of beauty is about transcendence. The desire to be this kind of beautiful and the desire to be enlightened, talented, and famous have common roots.  They all relate to transcending the norm and reaching a level that is super-natural. That’s why this kind of beauty is more about BEING than ATTRACTING, and would explain why women put on make up in a vacuum. This type of beauty will always be a source of discontentment because it will always evolve to a different standard depending on what is rare and hard to achieve. Unlike the first type, this seeks to transcend time and physicality altogether. This is why runway models lack child-bearing features. It’s more about power and status than reproduction. In fact, this neotenous type of beauty rejects reproduction altogether while presenting the ideal of youth without end."

"Calling Jordan Peterson “my Daddy Dom” skskskhahah"
"I find this a bit odd, because I feel beautiful most of the time and maybe have a few days here and there where I do not. I do not use the filters that change your shape or what not, but do change lighting in pictures with filters. I apply make up with a regular mirror that I can hold. I do not sit in front of a mirror and do not look at myself for hours. I also do not like taking more than 20 minutes to a half an hour applying make up, usually less time. Sometimes I will not wear make up at all and sometimes I will only wear mascara and lipstick. If I wear more make up I use the colors to express how I feel and I occasionally apply literal bodypaint if I am feeling extra expressive. What is so strange about this is, is that if we are comparing basic societal beauty standards then you are probably considered far more perfect than I would be. Yet, somehow, I feel awesomely attractive most of the time! And am not lacking in choice. And I am 40. WTF is this now?!"
"I think u have body dysmorphia disorder.. get therapy"
"after that reference im wondering if you have a psychoanalyst? i finally found one. seems like a rarity these days with CBT being the 'gold standard'"

"sorry, nat, I think this is the first video of yours that I will need some time to finish watching... as a cis person I understand my body hatred and self-loathing experience is different from that of a trans person - but the obsession with looking or being beautiful is something I am still struggling quite hard with. I will come back to this when I am ready to unpack some of my own feelings"
"Thou art Goddess"
"ChadGlow HAHA!!! I died!"
"I will forever call random internet stanges judging me the tabliods"
"I want to become beautiful so I don’t worry about being ugly 60% because of boys"
"Please, don't fuck the revolution :'("
"You're so so beautiful, smart, cool, and funny. And that's only a little bit of para-social bullshit. But really, you are important."
"Can we talk about that INTRO? GIRL I was SHAKING"
"so many iconic moments in one video, thank you for this good food"
"Style>fashion, Ned's Declassified was fighting capitalism WAY before it was cool."
"Are traps trasgender?"
"Did you say 'cunty'???OMG... I just love this channel!"
"No one does youtube videos like you. PERIOD."
"'Like maybe on Halloween'. Oh my god that's so true."
"Wow, I LOVE the satire of the whole beauty industry right now and I am just a couple minutes into this.  Welcome back, Natalie."
"FuQ'in TrannOids"
"The only thing that ever made me feel beautiful in a long term sense was allowing myself to feel ugly. I felt ugly my whole life, even though I look back and see that i was, in fact, a snack."
"I think you're a lovely human being--and so does my baby! He regularly gives you kisses when I'm watching your videos. 💕 Congratulations on your surgery!"
"So how old is Natalie? She's talking about ageing up in this bitch, like damn, I always thought she was like 25 or something."
"Our Queen has returned!!!   (Also, amazing music taste as usual)"
"aw I loved your nose <3 but good for you girl!"
"More like Satan's *_B A N A N A_* Eh?  EDIT: Also I wasn't thinking about whether or not what you were doing was plastic surgery, I was wondering what you looked like with your face pulled down to your nose. Because that's a weird mental image and I am now morbidly curios.   EDIT 2: Glad you are becoming more comfortable with yourself. But this is the sort of thing that makes me never _not_ support transhumanism and the extreme body-modding that comes with it. Once we're free to design our own bodies, we can all be the canvas through which we express our truest self, and be freed from the existential terror that is the workings of entropy in our personal lives."
"this was truly my life from age 11 to 20 but now im a lesbian and I am chilling on occasion"
"Must it 'needs' be, though?"
"I liked your 'mix of flamboyance, darkness and mish-mash' style, both when you were in the wrong body and after. Can't say if it was necessarily healthy (for you), but it was definitely appealing, and I think it's still there. I must say though, I might have to get used to this new Natalie's face. As with the style, there was a certain 'something' about your previous face, maybe an air of confidence, fake or not, or the uniqueness, or my secret inner gay, or maybe (and most likely) even just the habit of seeing you like that, that made it more appealing... BUT, I think it's just a matter of getting used to it, and in the mean time if it did good for you, for your self-image and empowerment, then that's all that should matter, right? Right? And if rationalizing being a slave to the systems you try critique helps you cope, all the more power to you; anyone who tells you they don't on any level are grade-A bullshitters. Still, be careful, the battle for The Beauty Standard is neverending, and while learning to accept that you like to be beautiful without punishing yourself for it may get rid of the 'academic guilt', it will do nothing to stop the crippling feeling of 'it's not enough! IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH!!' (and the time investment)."
"26:22 I dont like post ffs tabby"
"Missed you Lovely. I deeply relate to much of what you are saying, even if we don't share everything. You remind me there are wonderful people in this world. You make me want to make the world better for you, for me. I will stop now, I sound like an eighties pop ballad."
"Even with scars and scratches. The dark mother looks fabulous!"
"Thanks for sharing your... journey. I want FFS soon. It’s crazy how expensive it is. Idk if my insurance will cover it, if it doesn’t I’m going to try and have it done in the Philippines, or is it Thailand. One of those countries has really good surgery for trans patients. Can’t remember which one right now. Haven’t done much research yet. Just mostly trying to afford keeping the lights on right now. Had some hair removal, but it’s super expensive too and not covered by insurance. I wish insurance would consider trans conformation surgery as outside of being cosmic surgery."
"I would never think you're Mother Teresa! You're not an anti-choice zealot who pretends to help the poor but actually just has a ghoulish obsession with poverty."
"At the risk of coming off as another creepy dude on the internet, goddamn Contra you look stunning. I didn’t really feel like you needed work done to look good but you now also look amazing. I’m just happy you at least feel more comfortable with yourself regardless of what some weirdo on the internet thinks."
"Every single time I see dancing pikachu a bit of my frigid, uncaring heart thaws a bit."
"Hey I love this channel and your videos normally but some women don’t have a “not like other girls” complex about not wearing makeup. Some women are butch, some women don’t want to invest the time and money into makeup. Sometimes I just want to leave my house and not wear makeup. Simple as that. No reason, no internalized misogyny, though that can be a reason in some cases like you said. Women wearing or not wearing makeup is always perceived as a statement. I just want to exist sometimes.  Anyway, I’ll finish the video."
"ContraPoints, the internet's best camgirl."
"ilysm"
"I feel like this is S02E01 of this series."
"Oh yummy, a new Contra video"
"that BSOD gave me a heart attack, Natalie"
"SOPHIE IS AN OBVIOUS PICK! LETS GO!"
"Girl, this video is me every day. I do think that representation will help us slowly break away from dehumanizing beauty standards. But I don't think that style makes much of a difference. My mom is very stylish, but she's still extremely insecure about her weight. Style is an armor that can be used, but only to a certain extent. I agree that we need to be kinder to ourselves for wanting to be pretty, but I'm not sure what to do.  My guy friends don't understand why it's so important. My female friends do. And it takes more energy than I'd like, and causes a lot of self-hatred."
"OH. MY. GOD. I AM SHOOKETH. WE HAVE QUEEN SOPHIE IN THIS YASSSS"
"Love the Fear and Loathing reference at 21:16"
"Glad you are back and well"
"Your sequins are giving me LIFE!!!"
"Beauty? Isn’t that thing that vanished by your 30s or 40s if you are rich or asian"
"I get it, for sure. What I like most about you is your personality and intellect, now that shit is HOT and I am definitely straight, but I'd probably still fuck you down, lol... You are also conventionally attractive as well though, lol."
"You've been a woman for what 2 years now?  Just let more years pass.  You're basically still an adolescent when it comes to this aspect of being female."
"Wow...keep up the good work!!!"
"But like, what if your dad taught you that all you need to do to get laid is to listen to what women say? Oh, and be nice. Oh and then, contribute to a civil conversation? Damn. I probably just out'ed what my age is. Thanks Dad. Women are wonderful to be around, if you simply listen to what they have to say. (And use a lot of condoms. XD)"
"Yay now you look a completely normal basic bitch. (Sorry, you look great though congrats)."
"When it comes to personal appearance, I want to say that I have a laid back attitude. Just look how you want to be confident and happy!"
"I would do anything for dancing Detective Pikachu"
"Being NB every time I think about whether or not to put on makeup is like me playing tennis with myself."
"17:02 I need more of this *snap* keep *snap* snapping"
"Loved this video. Been having really long convos about beauty with friends recently and it was nice to have someone I look up to talk about it in an intelligent way. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the ethics of beautification - which you did sort of touch on in this video - but I'm a greedy whiny internet person who wants more free content xD    Love ya"
"The Skull of the CHAD omg aahhhhhhhhhhhh"
"I legitimately love your laugh."
"Hell yeah 9 times out of 10 if I'm wearing heavy makeup it's because I'm sitting at my vanity late at night drunk with no men around and just want to play with bright red lipstick and crazy eyeshadow because it's fun"
"I think lesbians, butch ones especially, have a very complicated relationship with beauty.   I’m a butch lesbian, and I try my hardest to look sexy, but I sometimes feel restricted by arbitrary nonsense. I can’t wear makeup, because that’s feminine and it makes me feel bad about myself. I can’t wear clothes from women’s sections, because I feel uncomfortable, even though they fit me better. My jawline will never be sharp and square, unless I get work done.   I know quite a few lesbians who have this complicated relationship with beauty, because it’s like we’re actively fighting the male-gaze beauty standards. So butch lesbians often fall into the trap of never being able to get beauty right, since the goals are often made up by the person, and thusly can fluctuate.   I cut my hair, I wear sports bras and boxers, I shop exclusively in men’s sections, but at the end of the day I often feel like I will never be handsome. I hate my height and how small my feet are, but those are things I can’t change. Beauty, for butch lesbians, is often the hardest thing to deal with. Unless you look naturally androgynous, of course."
"Great video! Please put a seizure warning for that intro!"
"J O U R N E Y"
"My mama told me not to trust a pretty face, but I ain't so smart, so....I'm listening."
"So, what are your thoughts about seeing yourself in the future as an aged woman? What does define an attractive older woman for you that you would like to be one day?  For the record, I as a cis-man find women like Christine Lagarde or Theresa May quite attractive (if I forget what they are politically representing), and I find it pretty hard to pin down why, but there's something and I wonder what you think you might need to embody that?   ... and yes, a lot of us guys fret about that too and wonder what makes a 'hot older guy'."
"as a lesbian i must unfortunately refute the claim that i am straight chillin, i'm actually gay chillin"
"mmmmmm I smell erik satie"
"Lets chose some flattering words so that she loves my comment but she doesn't feel its fake: you have a striking similarity to one of my best friends, she is beautiful, the only girl I ever felt something for,  because gayness, after your surgery you look even more similiar and its becoming a bit cringy. Anyways I hope that one that you can look at the mirror and see beauty privilege."
"as a lesbian with chronic body dysmorphia i can confirm we are definitely not “straight chillin’”"
"I dont know how exactly its done, but would you be able to add in your own subtitles instead of the automated ones? (also I love your videos! Hi Contrapoints!)"
"Seeing a new video of yours in my feed makes me want to kill myself a bit less. Thanks, Natalie 👍"
"Honestly Natalie your video speaks so much to me about what's been on my mind lately- like sure it's great that society is constantly screaming at us 'YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL THE WAY YOU ARE, LOVE YOURSELF' but fundamentally, there's actually nothing wrong with wanting to be attractive? Or beautiful? It's a pretty standard desire to have and yet these days it's become so ostracized to feel that way. If you feel stunning without all the make up, hair and clothes I think that is absolutely incredible but likewise there is also nothing wrong with putting in that time and effort in order to feel that way. Afterall, we're only young and/or alive for so long, might as well make ourselves look the way that we want while we last am I right?"
"When you were talking a lot at the beginning and go “ahhhhh” that was hilarious!!!"
"That's some Erik Satie at 25:13. I like it :)"
"Great job, you have a skillful grasp on humour, insight and common experiences. I second sentiments regarding body neutrality, and I must say that Dairy Queen bit was peak trans humor 😆👏🏻"
"I think I have body dysmorphia. I lost weight two years ago and now I still feel like I'm fat, and have an intense fear of being bigger. So I can't relax. I'm a perfectly healthy weight, but I just constantly feel fat. I don't feel pretty or beautiful. I don't know if I ever have felt beautiful. I'm terrified if I gain weight that I'll go back to being as miserable as I was before, even though I'm not really all that happy now anyway. I hate my fucking body and myself. Noone finds me attractive. I just want to have a nice body. And now I've got all these fucking issues with food and it's all just like why the fuck can't I just be happy, why do I restrict for ages then binge like a fucking idiot? What is it all for, what does it matter, why am I so scared to be fat, why do I need to pass as skinny? I'll never pass as skinny but I was sort of thin and I keep fucking it up with food god I hate myself."
"You know its a banger of an episode when it opens with SOPHIE"
"Holy crap that shirt is glorious!"
"you're so awesome. thank you for this video. i'm a cis woman and i reeeeeeeally needed that."
"Hello gorgeous!!"
"You looked beautiful before and still look beautiful now; so glad you’re back and happy ❤️"
"Natalie I'm a bi woman and I have such a crush on u"
"Trashcan. k."
"You can smell the bulgarian rose Feels"
"17:35 What? When did people start crying about collar bones?"
"i like your style"
"In keeping with the stereotype I am a straight guy and I found you more attractive when you started the makeup routine.  Sorry Natalie!"
"Wow who would’ve guessed your plastic surgery did not cure your mental illness and you still feel depressed. The right is vindicated once again on the T girl question. You have a mental disorder and no amount of facial reconstruction, genital mutilation, or expensive makeup products can fix that. I guess it’s too late for you at this point to go back and you just have to ride this life out with depression and insecurity."
"Are you misgendering me at this dairy queen or are you just staring at my dilly bar"
"I love you.  Welcome back! 'Maybe she's born with it, maybe she payed a surgeon to peel her face off.' Your dark sense of humor speaks to my soul.  And by my soul I mean the one I stole form this flesh bag I am riding around in."
"brought to you by dairy queen thanks"
"I wonder if we preoccupy ourselves with menial things like personal beauty instead of larger, more societal problems because it's easier to control what's right in front of us? Idk that's how it feels for me anyway"
"Shes back!!! I keep forgetting how much I like Contrapoints till I watch her videos again"
"The removal of hair could also be because the hair might ( I don’t know this is true after you go on estrogen.) be because the hair is rather thicker so it’s an extension of your dysphoria so to alleviate it you remove it. :/ I could be wrong."
"If it helps at all, here’s one thing that helped me when I was working to love myself and maybe it could help you too. I looked in the mirror, found one thing (no matter how small it is) that I liked about myself, and said “I am beautiful” over and over, even when it felt uncomfortable. Then I broadened my focus more and more and did the same thing until I could call myself beautiful comfortably while looking at myself fully."
"i love the choice of satie's 'gymnopédie no. 1'!  it made me smile!"
"the editing at the beginning is fuckin raw"
"as a lesbian i can confirm that we really do just be chilling"
"I have been thinking about this topic for forever and am glad you have put forth your viewpoint on it."
"Love you ma'a. We need to get onto the areté bullshit. I think that the old fool was onto something when he proposed to shape our desires by shaping our habits. Exercising self love just may be one of those.  Also as a non-binary snowflake I refuse to conform to your generalisations. As long as open-ended questions exist I shall keep imposing my queerness upon the students of psychology. Maybe one day they will even include me in the options."
"That was the darkest Erik Satie I've ever heard"
"30 seconds in and i’m already amazed"
"You passed before FFS and you pass after FFS. I have no idea what the fuck that backhanded complimenter was even talking about. Like...what a total dick thing to say. I'm sorry that shit happens to you, Natalie. That must be really fucking tough on you. You don't deserve that shit. Here's hoping you have more positive people in your life."
"14:00 um. Okay. Um. Um she said daddy dom and called herself a brat. Wtf. Wtf. What's going on. Pls help. Is this slowly transitioning into a bdsm channel? Yeah? Gotcha."
"Opening with SOPHIE now that is class"
"Bone lady’s highlight is sickening."
"Man you always say things I have trouble articulating you’re the best"
"Asmr please! Even if it's just once!"
"That o p e n i n g"
"she managed to have a SOPHIE song for her intro... that's the gag of the season"
"I just love it when she laughs at her own jokes"
"In my opinion it depends on the job. I get annoyed with girls who have long nails when the job involves a lot of dirty work with your hands. Do what you want but don't start blaming your nail tech when it's on you for wanting to work with nails."
"As a transdude who plans on getting fms this video has helped me construct a better explanation about why I plan on getting it in a way that’s more okay(?) for cis people"
"I can speak to the body dysphoria as a straight guy. I had borderline body dysphoria a year ago. I hated myself and it lead me into a psych ward. The thing that helped me GREATLY was not only professional-help but my boys BTS. It was around Love Yourself: Answer and idol came out. I started to actually lead to love myself."
"L O O X M A X I N G ~mewing~ ~skin maxing~ ~etc~"
"It bothers me that the things you mentioned about wanting to look beautiful, even being aware and critiquing how the idea of it has been molded by various outside forces, hits so close to home. It bothers me because I'm a cis hispanic male that carries all the baggage that comes with that upbringing and it saddens me that these issues go beyond the labels/backgrounds. I also want to look beautiful; I get so anxious before I go out that I have to set aside 2 hours minimum before I leave the house and change shirts too many times, among other things. All that effort just to look back in the mirror and feel ugly anyway. Makes me avoid going out at all since it's so damn exhausting.  I also take comfort in the pain though because it reaffirms my understanding that there are aspects of life we can all share in the joys and pains of, regardless of background and we can all find common ground instead of the tribalism that is firing on all cylinders lately.  Though those specific life circumstances and influences that are innumerable shouldn't be disregarded either. They are also important in trying to develop comprehensive understanding and solutions.   Fuck it, I'm with you on the idea of just wanting to focus on the aesthetics and not the apocalypse. I know it's your Darkness, but I hope there is room under your stylish umbrella for an internet stranger looking for a friend who happens to agree with you and shares your sense of humor.  I appreciate you taking on the mantle of Contrapoints. Just please make time for Natalie; she's important too. Thank you for another wonderful, thoughtful video."
"I stan"
"This video is hitting too close  It's like a mirror and i feel like shattering it, i dunno if i will tho   [In natalie voice]: that's profound?? Right?"
"The east wants to turn girls into boys, the West wants to turn boys into girls- i just want to be a level 35 mafia boss..."
"Oh girl, you captured my existence with that bit about feeling guilty for obsessing over trying to mask facial flaws when we could be using the time to fight against the climate change crisis. I just want to not feel like an ugly poop but putting on & taking off makeup, and subtly facetuning the fuck out of photos takes forever."
"mother has uploaded."
"Girl: there I was wondering where Contrapoints be at and then I came home to this, I love synchronicity ;) Your work is amazing, thank you Natalie!"
"Didn’t Emma Goldman say something like what’s Revolution worth without dancing or something like it’s something like that"
"You are beautiful. You were beautiful. Do you. Be happy. Love always."
"You looked better before."
"From  Chadzilla to  Stacysaurus 😍😍😍"
"So here I was feeling the profound, unyielding pain that can only come from what is truly one of the most horrible things any one person can suffer: sucking at video games. When suddenly, I saw this in my sub box and knew I'd be okay. After all, what better to aid with feelings of despair than a new video from one of your favourite -camgirls- YouTubers whose entire channel is about the desperate struggle against the unending pain of existence...   ...And also trans-catgirl memes?"
"This is really funny. Great job."
"as a cis white man this...actually hit me. I actually care way too much about my beauty sometimes. Some days I say fuck it and I wear eyeliner and eye shadow smudged to fuck or for a few days in a row all grungey, other days i do give a fuck and im crying at my goddamn cheekbones. The more I look in the mirror to apply my makeup, the more often I notice facial features and care about my appearance. I like wearing makeup and I couldnt care less what it looks like sometimes, but the more I apply it in the mirror the more conscious I become about my face etc.  I know this is trivial in comparison to others, i know im not..un attractive (i hope). Got a beautiful Girlfriend who loves me and thinks I'm attractive and I know she sees me and doesn't really care what i look like, but even then its not enough sometimes and I need to feel beautiful and look attractive, I get self conscious about what strangers think about me, friends, family, classmates etc.   But this is also incredibly difficult, when your own personal beauty standards etc do not align with the norm anyway. So things that make me feel attractive are not attractive to others etc.  I think what Im trying to say here is: drunk cis man rambles about beauty standards suck but they effect us all no matter how much we try to avoid them. Also makeup fun, i want my eyes on fleek in the revolution"
"27:28 👍😎💜 tears of joy!"
"You actually do pass though, before and now. You looked alot like this girl who I used to play tennis with and she was cis so your all good chief."
"im not a fan and i think youre pretty just cuz you look like a pretty lady who'd be a teacher that is just really pretty and all the boyz get crushes on"
"modern medicine is super lit your vids are too"
"I'm a straight guy and I have the same feeling when I look at myself in the mirror - I have a really hard time judging myself (I wonder if this is a common thing? I've never asked anyone). It used to bother me when I was younger, which probably had to do with being bullied at school and being generally really insecure through most of my teens. But since then I've come a long way in self-esteem and these days the mirror-emptiness doesn't cause me anxiety, as long as I look vaguely presentable. But it does mean that I can't evaluate changes to my appearance, so I always just regress back to the mean for familiarity's sake. On one hand it's kinda liberating, but on the other I always wonder what it would be like to have a vision of how I want to look, some sense of style. Appearance as a means of expression has always been a bit alien to me, I've got nothing to express in that medium. Anyway it's cool to know I'm not the only one who has the mirror thing.   P.S. it might not mean much coming from me, possibly the least style-conscious entity in the known universe, but you look great with or without makeup. Also I have a hard time believing that any of your critics would doubt your womanhood if they didn't already know who you are. They're just working backwards from the fact that you're trans to imagine evidence that isn't there."
"It's weird thinking about body types with gay men. like, I've always wanted to look like a fem twink, but my shoulder's are too broad because I played rugby for a long time, and I'm too tall.  It used to frustrate me constantly when I was in college. It made me miserable because I've never felt very masculine, but everyone assumes I am because of the way I look. When in reality I'm a gigantic bottom bitch.  I really don't want to look like a masculine man, but I dunno what to do about it"
"What is the song that plays near the middle of the video? I've heard it before"
"As a straight cis-gendered fuck boy, I have sincerely been contemplating the mouthfeel."
"What's the name of the ending song? It's one of my faves but it's super old or something and I keep forgetting it."
"I love you Natalie! Drool and all XD"
"It’s hard to escape conventional beauty standards because they’re so deeply ingrained into our everyday lives. However, you’re entitled to do whatever makes you feel beautiful. If that happens to align with conventional beauty standards, that’s not something to feel guilty about. Beauty means something different to everyone and if that’s what it means to you, you should express that. I don’t see it as upholding standards, but expressing your beauty freely as everyone should be able to do."
"DONT FUCK THE REVOLUTION."
"you having a genuine moment dragging your nails across those sequins has made my life.   in all seriousness, thank you for such a frank conversation for this new video. for women and ideas around beauty, we're damned if we do, damned if we don't, and all the more damned when we have conflicting feelings between wanting to express ourselves but having our ideas about how to do that shaped by things like advertising and the environments we've grown up in."
"I’m a California 4 but a Walmart 9.2"
"Impeccable use of the Lindsay Ellis “It’s fine. I’m fine. It’s fine. It’s fine.”"
"I would do unspeakable things to get a full ASMR video from Natalie. Lol"
"That top is 🔥🔥🔥 tho"
"The surgery results are very good. You did not turn yourself into a caricature as some women do."
"I think we need to backpedal human evolution. We were never meant to pay other people to slice bits of our faces off. I snub my nose unashamedly at anyone who partakes in the batshit crazy first-world phenomenon that is cosmetic surgery."
"I was about ready to get angry at the idea of spending $$,$$$ on slicing up your face to look marginally different, especially when there are so many homeless drug addicts on the streets of Baltimore who will go to bed tonight with no heroin, but dammit Natalie! She done pulled that self-awareness trick and it worked to neutralize my millennial rage, transforming it into pure, homoerotic energy. How did she know my weakness was for cynical, self aware acknowledgements of the more controversial aspects of her actions? How?"
"Not sure if you’ll ever see this but earlier today I was reading the passage from the Vulgate (Ecclesiastes) that goes “Vanitas Vanitatum” and so forth. When you said it my day came full circle thank you"
"I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU USED A SOPHIE SONG!!! 🙌"
"You look lovely and natural"

"Natalie SNAPPED"
"Yo i vibe so well with the whole not being able to tell if I’m attractive or not in the mirror, like, I don’t see myself as ugly or attractive. I’m just, there. Y’know?"
"Also, she looks really good... *squints eyes* ... for an acedemic ... I don't trust her... Too pretty to be too smart."
"Natalie, you were always stunning to me but I'm happy you love your new look minus a few millimeters of bone. It looks good on you."
"Is there a significance to The Easy Winners by Scott Joplin at 28:35, or did you just think it sounded right for the part?"
"I'm an asexual man who feels quite accomplished about simply shaving with some care when I can be bothered (so I can just sit there accepting that I did ABSOLUTELY ALL I COULD to not look like a ghoul but it can't be helped) , and here I am, fully invested.  Also you called us goblin-swine and the word 'Goblin' never fails to amuse me."
"I'm reminded of Orlando 's comment upon seeing his/her change of sexes....' Same person....'"
"What's with that AWESOME INTRO?!"
"I feel like I have similar thoughts about my weight. Like I keep trying to frame it in my head as 'well I should live a healthier lifestyle because it's good for me' but when I get down to it, I kinda just want to be thin and I want to be thin largely to be more beautiful. Aaaaaaand then I just want to eat junk food cause I feel like shit, so that sucks. Idk where I'm going with this or anything, but it's nice to hear someone be blunt about wanting to look pretty for pretty's sake, ya know?"
"I'm so honored to be a part of your journey"

"'If I'm not running late for something I will do a face mask, but if I'm out of bed it's because I'm running late for something, so... I've never done a face mask' i cackled"
"I decided years ago that as a disabled and a fat woman (in a chair, so I get lots of pity looks), that I was going to go the style route. And it works for me, it really does, but I still get upset about not being able to meet societal beauty standards.   There’s also the fact that an extremely set type of style (in my case rockabilly and vintage) takes away from those pity looks- I want to be remembered as that rockabilly chick with the victory rolls, not the fat chick in a wheelchair. And there’s also the possibility that as I’m a fat chick in a wheelchair, I feel that I’m not holding up my end of femininity, not being the pleasing objet d’art that is my role as a woman. And so, if I doll myself up in an individual and unique (ish) way,I’m making up for that? It’s really complicated.   So yes to style, but it certainly doesn’t fix the issue (as you pointed out)."
"Plastic surgery...my dear  Ps: you mentioned it was coming up shortly"
"@ 0:18 I swear I screamed. YOU LOOK GOOOOOD GURL!"
"I am a transwoman and i have lost alot of my years being depressed and locked up in an dark room without any perspective. The only person who really tried to help me was my sister, and still i had to hear the classic 'try to accept youself', 'you are beautiful' (I completely not pass as a woman).  I am happy for you contra,  despite a certain envy because all my suffering and depression was and is because of my appearance. But know that i really admire you, you are really inteligent, doing something good on internet, you were beautiful before the surgery and are even more beautiful now. <3"

"You all loose too much time with vain topics. You live in a fantasy world and have no idea how the rest of us live. I’ve lived in Boston for some time. I’m from Brazil.  Poverty, disease, hopelessness, exploration, violence. Get close to those things and you see whats true (avoidable) suffering. If you want to not only signal virtue, but trully become a virtuous individual, you could use your time, money and energy to - as Philosophy is such an important matter, and mass exposure - to develop new tools to end or mitigate peoples suffering. Your disphoria, your fights against climate change, racism, fatphobia: none of them matter as they pale in comparison to the true plights of this world. They matter, but not that much. As Marx would say - It’s the economy, stupid!  But you can’t know that as you live in a shell. As Buda did before leaving his palace.  Of course I see kindness, sharpness, hope and honesty in you. And I do like you so much and understand your original paradigm of privileges. Not judging, just saying you could walk away from your american palace to ser the world outside of it.  You have so much more to be and become. Then your struggle will end and all of that will be futile and in the past. And you won’t suffer anymore asking yourself if you are beautiful. Of course you are. And you can do all of that still being as gorgeous as you are right.  Sorry for the harsh words. It’s from a place of love and search for wisdow. Should I ask more from you? No, but I’ll do it nonetheless.  So every boy and girl in the world could suffer from disphoria and uglyness in a confy bed and well fed.  Yours, trully. Pedro."

"I just wanted to say that this channel has actually been a really big influence for me when it comes to personal growth. I've learned so much about myself as a person just by watching these videos and reflecting on what I've learned from them. I really like the way this sort of confusing dissonance and stigma is confronted and dissected in these videos. I came to ContraPoints as a repressed person who was fearful of her own desires, and I'm finally learning to accept myself and even maybe understand myself. Thanks in no small part to this channel, I've started to unravel all of the cognitive issues that I thought were healthy coping mechanisms but were only getting in my way. THANK YOU SO MUCH for doing what you do!!"

"AHHH the Fear and Loathing reference about skincare collections. I knew I loved you for a reason."
"Your skin care routine is similar to mine lol"
"I will say that without makeup, you look weirdly like one of my cis female friends. Not 'weirdly' like 'cause she's cis and you're trans get it,' 'weirdly' like 'you could be long-lost sisters.' With makeup on, however, you look nothing like her. It's very trippy, especially since this video in particular goes back and forth.   I feel you on the body hair thing. I've been considering taking T, but for all that I want specific results, I don't think I could stand more body/facial hair. Why can't it be the future already? Then I can upload my brain to a computer and look like a stained glass hurricane if I want."

"cute"
"That was                                EPIPHANY !!! Better than orgasms. Yours 'style' concept is (opinion) precisely what we need to build personality, to end conflict. Beauty is a biological conflict device to push animals ( humans) into natural competition and selection. But we do not need that at thise stage, humanity had the first 'singularity': culture; our bodies are not evolving faster than our scientific capabilities to shape the fisical world, we do not have to subject to fisical darwinism. So daddy Peterson does not understand Darwin's evolution theory, most people don't (they think they do).  Beauty does not exist as a constant, search for 'lotus feet', that's the bauty device I've mentioned. Beauty is an variable, and if it is not unethical, it is ok to enjoy it, like drugs and sex; also the moderation factor to not kill yourself.  There is also the second kind of beauty, contemplation; it is pure affection and sympathy. Mothers have this contemplation for their children (not always, a tragedy), and it's the golden gift of true friends and lovers, they will contemplate your existance and manifestations in this world no matter what happens to your body. We need ethical standards, and shifting them is not instantaneous, but politically quick, like fashion trends or getting in to a new sexual fetish, insist on the 'style' and will change the standard, not from a capitalist  social high hierarchy position, but from an artistic position. It is already working, I  now apreciate the beauty of all races, before feminism and antiracism, only hollywood movie whyte blondes.  (all my opinion, not facts) Sometimes CP is better than cocaine ! Well done Natalie."

"@contrapoints I think you're being unfair to yourself at the 18:20ish mark when you get positive comments from fans.

More importantly, thank you for the work you're doing, I'm proud to be a patron to this effort."

"*Beauty is such shit.* As someone who was utterly hideous and bullied to psychological shambles for my entire life and have become only slightly above average, I can attest to the fact that being even somewhat physically attractive alleviates little to no inner turmoil. The most that has changed is that I don't really feel like I need plastic surgery but that also might have just been getting used to feeling hideous. I still feel ugly even if I've been complimented before. More importantly, even when I do feel attractive, when I feel I've gotten to that point in my appearance which I longed for when I was horribly bullied every single day of my life, now, I just feel... empty. And that wasn't what I expected to feel after being someone who incessantly prayed to God, or--after I dropped that bitch like a stone--would post images of myself on online forums and look at myself for literal hours in the mirror and felt literal existential dread.  I swear to God I hate this wild goose chase that capitalism has us on to feel the sense of meaning it's taken from us. Some sense of satisfaction in a system that doesn't want you to. The beauty industry is a damn behemoth and even in the effort of liberation of men from their gender expectations, it's only grabbing us into the shit women have had to deal with forever. At this point, late-capitalism feels like the void itself.  It'll engulf our planet beyond repair and the human soul along with it. *Fuck capitalism.* And _THAT'S_ the true tea, sis. ✊🏼"

"as a recovered anorexic nb person I totally feel the complications of figuring out if something is gender dysphoria or just like.... not gender related body image issues. I completely fucked my metabolism in high school so I wear a size 14 now and like.. looking in the mirror is painful, and figuring out what is and isn't gender related seems to be impossible, they're intrinsically linked.   Was my anorexia a manifestion of gender dysphoria? was it because I'm DFAB and women face a lot of pressure to keep their weight down? is the pain I feel when I see myself dysphoria (valid) or internalized fatphobia (not valid)  these are questions that haunt me all the time and I don't think there's a clear answer"
"My beautiful train left when I was born. I have to settle for trying to be funny and clever. Of course i'm neither of those things either. Love your videos! <3"
"Since I was eleven Ive cried myself into oblivion looking at my face in the mirror. I never felt like a pretty girl until I figured genderqueer was a thing u can be and it alleviated sm pain. I wasn't a woman and that's why I could never feel like one. But I still take 10-15min videos of myself  and 'acting natural' and then watch them over and over and usually cry bc some unsymmetrical facial feature. And I know this is an ugly obsessive behavior and by doing it I'm just going to hate myself and start judging others the same way but it doesn't stop me bc some part of me still believes that beauty is completely objective either you're in or you're out and I'll NEVER be in. However at this point i know the real reason is bc beauty is power and I want ppl to listen to me and do what I say yikes (side note so much of the crying and hatred stopped when I accepted myself as non-binary so s/o gender visibility on the internet) thank u for the video ❤️"
"I’m cisgender, but I find watching your “journey” so cathartic. Even though I’m not trans, I find myself somewhat jealous of your evolution. That probably sounds so privileged, and I’m sorry for that . . . but here me out.  There is so much about my life and body that I either regret or otherwise wish to change. Seeing someone—seeing you—take that first step (and those later steps) and working so hard to become who you can be is beyond inspiring.  I often fantasize about abandoning those parts of my life I don’t like and starting anew. I am, sadly, a bit of a coward and so afraid of failure that oftentimes I recoil at opportunities to change because of that fear. Your courage and willingness to affirm yourself in a way that is much more drastic than anything I would ever consider doing is something I wish I had the fortitude to do. I wish I had your bravery and strength.  Thank you for all you do, Natalie."

"When I was a teenager, I used to be really fat. And dreamed about being thin beautiful. A Lot. Then a condom broke and plan b didn't work and I ended up having a kid at 19 yrs old (abortion Is not legal where i live). I was a depressed pregnant teen, and a deeply depressed recent mother. And I was thin. Finally thin. Skinny thin. Never been so miserable. So I got to a point where there was no escape from me and how I treated myself. But, even after years of therapy, i still crave not just beauty but everything asociated with it. There Is other way to change society and It's education. Where i live, one of the axes of Sex Ed Is related to body image, beauty and self care, encouraging diversity and style above social pressure. Perhaps it Will take some Time, but we are on it."

"I have a serious question, is looking at photos of transgender people pre transition alright or is it transphobic, because I started watching contra before her transition and I had remembered as a dude I wanted the type of hair she had pre transition so I started looking at her pre transition photos of Contrapoints, however I felt kinda bad about looking at what she looked like beforehand because that was the person she didn't want to be  anymore. So it okay or no ?"

"Hey Natalie just letting you know that as a shitty online goblin that I am, I totally used to think that you were lovely but sadly didn't pass. That's absolutely changed now the surgery was a huge success. You look like a gorgeous woman now and it still looks like your face so congrats and walk tall."
"This video made me think but also gave me hope <3"
"Natalie, have you been watching too much of Nick Nocturne's work? Cause I swear, some of the camera cuts and effects you use are straight out of a horror Webseries, sometimes. (And holy CRAP are they effective in driving the underlying messages home...)"
"This video made me confront my face blindness bc I didn't realize what had happened and I map recognition to silhouettes and colour more than minor facial proportions... Can see it when I look for it though! Love the breakdown as usual  I will also say, going from the rigid beauty standards of women, to the...???... Of men.... Has been a very disorienting thing. A lot of the traits that made me unattractive as a woman now aid my passing extremely (muscular, big cheek and jaw bones, larger hands and feet, broad shoulders, big trapezoid muscles, small downward pointing breasts set wide on large pecs). I'm so used to defining myself as ugly based on these that I find myself still wishing I looked like models on occasion despite the fact that, in reality, looking like that, existing in that shape would be dysphoric hell. But I still feel like I can't be beautiful to people without it. And I desperately want to be beautiful, no matter that it's never been achievable for me. I am glad that sometimes I can offer a counterpoint to trans lady friends who hate themselves for similar traits, because, that's... What some cis women just look like. We're so used to only seeing a tiny fraction of how female bodies look that not only do people have no concept of the variety, they actively don't see those who don't fit. I went from being totally invisible as a mildly disappointing lamp to a human being. I kind of dread the dissonance of what might happen if I lose weight. I don't want to have to confront just how much less of a human being I seem like to people and have to wonder, which of those I know after, would turn on me if I reverted?"
"As a cis man who watches your show, I just want to say that you look fucking beautiful and I know it doesn't matter that I'm saying because I could be literally anyone, but I hope you read this and take it to heart coz it's fucking true. I never post Youtube comments, but just the chance of you reading this is worth it."
"My beautiful goddess! What a way to end the day!"
"I'm glad you brought up women being seen as vain or frivolous for wearing makeup in academia/male dominated fields. I love wearing a lot of makeup its so much fun, but as I'm studying economics and work in a financial planning business I get frequently judged for it. People think I'm shallow, or that I care too much about my looks, or even that I'm 'wasting time on vanity instead of studying/working', even when all I did was put on eyeliner. The worst part is, you cant wear no makeup either. You have to wear the perfect amount of makeup that makes you look naturally perfect without wearing too much to look fake or noticeable, its so stupid."
"love the intro"
"It's been too long. I am so happy."

"2:56 - ROFL I had to pause the video!🤣"
"'What is going through my head?' *Detective Pikachu dancing*"
"Mmmmm, cunty."
"yea I mean I think style is what the lesbians are doing. we're chilling because we find flaws our flaws in other people, and it's attractive, so we're less focused on getting rid of flaws and more focused on pushing extremes of ourselves and having fun in our expression?"
"Magnifique madame!"
"Mate I would kill to feel beautiful for five seconds once a month, so I'm glad you get those moments for yourself. I've had to teach myself to not properly look in mirrors to avoid just crying all day at how much I fucking hate myself. Your solution of cultivating a style doesn't help me either - I love that nu goth aesthetic so damn much but every time I try it just brings more attention to everything that I hate about myself and I just end up feeling so disgusting that I can't bring myself to leave the house, even if it's for a good reason, like going and seeing my uncle with cancer in hospital. I dunno, this has just been the most depressing video you've ever made for me personally, sorry."
"Fuck yeah. The wierd cuts and lighting effects that I live for."

"I don't understand what it's like to be trans, but I do know what it's like to look in the mirror and hate what you see. I would give anything to just be comfortable with my reflection. I'm hoping if I finally get into shape... again, it will fix my poor self image. *Fingers crossed* and it's only going to take... years. Great. Oh well, we'll each get through it. I mean, what other choice do we have?"

"Ahhhhhh I knew a new video was coming out, I could feel it in my bones!!!!   Been checking the last week or so for the new contra video. So happy!"
"Got to say, your video was doing pretty well until you said something to the effect of 'If women were to be wearing makeup to attract men, then they'd stop wearing it when men weren't around.'  Honestly, this is a comment so below you're intellect its embarrassing, and I've never heard you say something so flippant. It honestly sounds like the argument 'if evolution were true, then why are there still monkeys?'   First, there's no reason to think that evolution is a rational process. There's no reason to think that women wear makeup because they are *consciously* trying to attract a mate. There are a whole host of animals that do such things, and there's not (usually) any reason to think that they're rationally thinking 'if I ruffle my feathers in this particular way I'll be more desirable.' There's just no reason to think that there wearing makeup or caring about appearance isn't instinctual in some way.   Second, you go on to suggest that women wear makeup in prison because they're trying to 'feel feminine.' Now, that might be true, but there's no reason to think that women aren't establishing some sort of hierarchy based off their appearance. Again, if you think that this has to be consciously thought, then you should read the above paragraph.  Honestly, I wouldn't be so embarrassed for you if you weren't so flippant about it. If only you would have said there are multiple reasons and evolutionary psychology is incredibly complex, I would have agreed with you. But its like you're hostile to this idea and you didn't give it the credit you typically do.  And I guess that's the point, I hope this comment ends up being constructive for you because I feel that you're a great thinker that I have respect for."

"I only eat cis-gender boiled eggs so I can whisper 'die, cis scum' under my breath during breakfast"
"Tbh I don't really care about how someone else goes about feeling good about themselves as long as it doesn't involve tearing someone else down. If you need to make someone else feel ugly to make yourself feel pretty, you should look into where the issue really lies because it isn't with the innocent people you insult to make yourself feel better."
"How does your content keep getting more and more hard hitting? Fucking love you Natalie!"
"I've heard other leftists say that Ivanka Trump looks like an 'ugly tr*ny'... that's regoddamndiculous...she's a 10 whether you like it or not people. I mean I don't particularly like her either lol, but don't lie and deny that she's beautiful.  Edit: bleeped out the slur...I apologize. 😬  Edit 2: I had to delete Reddit (where people said these things) because people were so mean it was causing panic attacks. Anyone who says they're immune to the hateful attacks - especially the personal ones - is lying to themselves. Just avoid it whenever possible and maybe get a Metatron's Cube or a net form of a cube (cross) to wear for a sense of protection. And work on talking to your subconscious - it's overpowering of thoughts despite how intelligent and consciously aware one is. Look yourself in the eye in the mirror and repeat 'I'm beautiful' and 'I'm loveable' several times a day. I have to talk to it like it's a 3 year old, but it works on repairing the damage."
"i'm glad this came out. how we look is as important as music, visual arts and other forms of aesthetics and expression. while external beauty standards should be fought and I think it's possible in the short-medium term to take those out (maybe except for certain forms of disability) even if you account for those or look within a single group you still see a hierarchy and trends for preferences. what we also need to fully invalidate the hierarchy is genuine anti aging technology and improved/abundantly accessible body modification/plastic surgery. if being beautiful is easy and common, and you know everyone looks how they want (even if they don't change their looks at all) then the hierarchy is redundant and it becomes an enjoyable and artistic thing. I also think many leftists like to pretend that dating is a meritocracy and looks preferences aren't a big deal but for many it really is. Logically, many people know that appearance based preferences just make dating harder, but it's not something that goes away. The same people who will deem stuff vapid or cringe are often the same people who you can't even get to stop making fun of how people look"
"Are peacocks ruined yet? ‘Cause their pretty good examples of style over beauty.

(Nowadays I’m more like the alley cat wandering the liquor store). The Female Beauty Panopticon fuckin sucks and interacting with it is about as close as you can get to a universal female experience.

"You were always Beautiful  You do you have an ideal  That ideal was built by influences in your life   for many they have unrealistic ideals and they have no intention of ever doing the work and spending the money  I have a lot of respect for Trans people because not only do they know what they want to be they often go out of their way to be it   I have a car full of friends coming and I'm not going to call trans because that would imply that's how they identify and that's not entirely true of the entire carpool regardless of the fact that that's what some other people might say about them.  These three people are at various stages of personal development both of their journey and in their  actual chronological ages and stages of their journey   I guess I've become something of the community resource as now I have people who are just beginning their process reaching out to me for help with costume and clothing they do live action role play or performance arts   So I guess my making of costumes and teaching of sewing helps <3    Anyway I watch you because I helped me better understand my friends  I don't want them to have to stop every 5 seconds to explain the terms to me   besides you have beautiful bone structure* and if you take care of your skin you'll always be beautiful  You had a very feminine look to start with and I don't know if you need surgery want it whatever you do you"

I also hold myself to unrealistic beauty standards & only occasionally look in the mirror & like what I see (if the makeup gods favored me that day & I don't look like I got socked in the eye by a 2x4)...

"Defining my own style and beauty standards really helped me in my early transition, and is still an important source of selfesteem and joy for me. Btw i also had my FFS on april 2 this year, so we are like totally (biological)surgery sisters now."
"#Bernie2020"
"it's a little weird to me that nat says the reason women in academia or anywhere don't wear makeup is to be masculine or 'not like other girls' and not because make up is work and an expense and a skill not everyone wants, intrinsically, to do? Why is NOT covering your face in paint masculine. Why is masculine the default state of skin. If make up is not part of your personal 'style' or aesthetic, is that masculine? Why is doing nothing masculine? These are serious honest questions from someone who feels like some kind of alien watching this.  I don't understand how im supposed to know what gender i am. I am physically so far off from my ideal aesthetic and honestly if we were really picking, I probably wouldn't want any of the weird flesh mech human skin options at all. So maybe I've just given up and that's why i don't get it.   But my choice not to wear make up unless its painting on a face to go pretend to be a Functional Human has nothing to do with masculinity or being not like other women. whatever that even means.  sorry. It was a fun video, as always, nat, but i guess this is just another part of Functional Humanity they didn't program into my brain"
"We had two bags of exfoliators, seventy-five pellets of snail mucus, five sheets of high powered hyaluronic acid, a salt shaker half full of vitamin C, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored halo, kiwi, sugar bear, biotin... and also a quart of moisturizer, a quart of concelaer, a case of toner, a pint of raw setting spray, and two dozen primers. Not that we needed all of that for beauty, but...."
"Ugh, I know it's trite, but you DO know you are pretty. Because it's you that decides."
"* hears SOPHIE *screams"
"Your arguments feel like scapegoats. I’m a woman and I’m a tomboy. Women who don’t like to wear a lot of makeup don’t necessarily do it because of pressure or whatever. Some people just value masculinity. I enjoy it. I like being a tomboy and I’m bisexual. I don’t do it for men. Sometimes I feel self concious because of acne but it doesn’t have much to do with male sexual attraction."

"You're a dude, get over it."
"1:21 10 hrs of Contra Points screaming AAAAAAHHHHHH pls. Thanks."
"The ending especially really struck a chord with me. I think the thing that helped me the most in my transition was playing a Roegadyn in FFXIV. The fact I had the opportunity to play such a *huge* woman, with broad shoulders, narrow hips, and strong facial features, really influenced my self-image as a trans woman. They were able to look so goddamn hot while also being 7'2' and muscular was the sort of representation I really needed. It inspired me to go to the gym, and my character's pale skin helped me work out my own personal style--the red, black, and white color scheme I default to these days."
"I get compliments on that style regularly, including my ever-improving muscle tone. :)"
"work well done tbh. still very recognizable"
"Contrapoints -- Helping me understand an entire community very slowly, one video at a time."
"So I stopped getting carded at bars last year and it honestly bothered me. And then it bothered me that it bothered me. I literally thought, 'Lord, I'm losing my ingenue appeal QUICKLY and I don't know what I'll do without it' and then felt like barfing about it. It's almost like all those years I spent being the ugly duckling and cultivating an actual personality just flew out the window when puberty finally fucking blessed me with its end. And then I feel like I'll never get those brain cells back, as much as I try to convince myself that beauty and brains aren't a dichotomy or zero-sum.   But then I look at you and other women and I KNOW instantly that you're beautiful, and I don't understand either why I just can't do the same for myself. So I appreciate this video, Natalie, more than you know. I feel a little less alone and, actually, a little bit better."
"Wow, this sounds painful. Looking great, tho."
"Natalie looks BEAUTIFUL! I was wondering when we'd see the results after FFS."
"You used to look better before the surgery :("
"As a fellow woman I'd like to say, 'same.' Very much the internal strangles of females. When it comes to makeup we want attention, we want people to say we're beautiful. But in our society we're demonize for such a vain thought as if our wants are evil. It's not about the men but wanting to look how we feel on the inside."
"so i guess if we're here that means we all like natalie's 'taste' :)   but in all seriousness, this is excellent (like always) and i think there's a critique of 'cancel culture' buried in here. not just the whole 'x person is problematique, x person is cancelled' but the way that people try to reject a social construct that, individually, cannot be rejected. like people who go dumpster diving to resist engaging in capitalism. i mean, sure, if it makes you happy, but for one thing: you refusing to participate in a social construct doesn't cancel that social construct. and two: these are the kinds of people who then turn around and criticize people for engaging in that social construct, claiming they're not 'woke' enough. like natalie says, you can be plenty woke, but you can still engage in a 'problematic' social construct, either for personal reasons or because the social construct is simply too big for one person to change or dismantle. wearing make-up might support the patriarchy and capitalism or whatever, but it can also support a person's self-worth and self-expression, and rejecting a social construct doesn't make it stop existing. even the rejection of a social construct is, in a way, engaging with it.   the best we can ever do is be mindful, be subversive, and pursue happiness while trying not to do active harm to ourselves or others."

"Bitch you started this video with SOPHIE ugh legends supporting legends we have no choice but to stan"
"Thank you for the video Natalie. I don't have much to add, I love the social commentary at the end, it's what I love about your channel and it's commentary like this that I find really invigorating.  As for the rest, I have no real concept of the subject material in regards to yourself, so I can't really comment on it.   Sorry I mean, 'Slay Queen, gorgeous (insert rudimentary meaningless flattery here) yaaas!'  I'll watch a few more times.  Be well."
"Thank you Natalie. I am nonbinary and constantly depressed and anxiety-ridden about my image, but you always make that pain a little duller with your presence. Hearing you make sense of all the tangled mess of insecure thoughts I have is so calming. So thank you. <33   Also, your surgery looks beautiful, and hope you had a good recovery! <333"

"You look great Contra, the change is simultaneously hard to notice but has a big effect. I hope it makes you happier in the future."
"Natalie alludes to the equation of beauty to youth a few times and so I'm curious if the dissatisfaction people find with their own personal beauty comes from a fear of death. If youth is some sort of timer that runs out and then we die and beauty is a sign of youth then maintaining beauty is like subconsciously fighting off death. Maybe the feeling of never being pretty enough comes from a dissatisfaction with life, like you feel like you haven't reached your potential yet and so you're trying to win more time at your shot at being happy. That's all just conjecture from me though, I don't know shit.    I hope you all feel beautiful today. You've done a great job, appreciate your work."
"I never closed other Contra's videos so quickly"
"Natalieeeeee. Marry me"
"'If all the men died tomorrow... ...F...'  You damn near took me out. I almost ran out of air. I saw a light. Oh shit that was funny. It felt like you T. Hanos snapped all the men away and I didn't feel so good Mr. Stark. Oh fuck I needed that."
"Yep this is relatable. It's what I've spent so much time talking about with my therapist and with my eating disorder (don't worry it's very much asleep and in remission). I am finding however that finding my own beauty standard has made be feel amazing. I'm lazy so why would I grow long hair, chopped it off. I'ma  dark as fuck black woman so why would I not embrace the Sunlight I'm a sun powered being. I love dresses and don't like to be told what to do. I still wear lipstick because lipstick is fun. Full face is to much work. I look forward to aging. I'm probably a 5/10 but I want to be a 5 going on 100 years."
"the video is super out of focus. but contents good"
"You said 'betwixt,' I like it already."
"You look great!  I'm glad you're recovering well, too.  Another great video!  <3"
"Brilliant as always and I dig the Satie playing us out. I had to orchestrate that piece in music school."

"You look great and it's not a lie."
"I can't figure out why as a nb trans man your videos about your experience as a trans woman are so interesting to me"
"Pre ffs you kinda look like Emily blunt"
"100% of the reason I wear make up is to protect myself from self attack should I catch an unflattering glimpse of myself or someone says something even mildly critical. The reason for my dysphoria is trauma, and learning to cope with that trauma at a young age by self attacking to the point where I hated myself so much that I thought Id be doing the world a favor if I killed myself. All this was still easier and less painful than confronting the real pain, and so my brain put up a wall completely separating the ideas. Bad things happened to me, and also I was ugly and worthless and should die, I thought, and it was very difficult to see that I felt that way BECAUSE of the bad things because the entire thing was a defense mechanism and my brain just doubled down under any self reflection. Thats why its painful to hear you realize you too are doing this defense (nothing makes you feel pretty enough even when you do things to be pretty) and decide the solution is to apply this to more people. Because you KNOW it doesnt matter what you look like. You KNOW you've had a flourishing career even while feeling ugly and that you have friends and people who want to be with you. You KNOW that outside yourself no one truly gives a shit how perfect you look. It is 100% not actually about how you look and actually about what youre running from."

"Natalie, I admit, I'm a fan, but I'm also brutally honest to the degree of almost sounding sociopathic (thanks, multiple exes). You're fucking gorgeous. I'm sorry. There's no other way to see it. You're one of the most beautiful, feminine women I've ever seen, and don't you let anyone tell you otherwise."
"I always leave your videos with additional mindsets to keep on the back-burner for a random real-world m i s g e n d e r i n g~  It's good to see you living life at your pace <3"

"I don't think 'skinmaxing' is meant to be some overly masculine term, pretty sure it's a play on the gaming term min-maxing: https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=min-max"
"Baby girl, this anxiety about beauty and never feeling good enough... Welcome to the club! You will invalidate whatever I say because of whatever anyone else says so it feels futile to even bother but, here's food for thought if you bother to hear me. I was fat. Always fat, my whole life. I spent all my time obsessed with how perfect my life would be if I was just skinnier. Then, I finally learned about calories and lost 100 pounds. I just knew if I was thin, everyone would love me. I'd get anyone, any job, anything I wanted if I was only thinner. Then, I lost my DD tits and stared at my flap jacks where my gorgeous big titties used to be in the mirror. Then I'd turn around and see my slimmer hips and flat ass. Then I'd just cry to my therapist about how nothing is ever just good. Men were suddenly less respectful and now aggressive at the gas station (I guess they figured fat me could kick their ass but thin me was defenseless). It was nothing I spent my whole life fantasising about. My point is, I think you're beautiful now and I thought you were beautiful then. You're going to get caught in a big tangled mess if you don't realize that you're the woman you are, were all different, we all look different. We're not a thing that fits into a cookie cutter and you'll find yourself surpassing a point of passing and going into a realm of looking like a stereotype of what a woman is based on nonsense. I'm happy for you to have this surgery and like I said, you're beautiful but try to see that because it's never going to be enough in your mind and then when do you get to be happy? It comes from loving yourself as who you are and who you are is beautiful. My mom died because of this toxic logic. She had gastric bypass because she dreamed of being this beautiful, skinny Stepford wife. It killed her in the end. She was beautiful. She looked like Linda Carter. She wasn't even heavy enough to qualify for the surgery so she saved up the money to pay a doctor under the table. She didn't need it and it's sad to me that she died never knowing how beautiful she really was. My best friend and I decided at her funeral we would always be willing to say we're BEAUTIFUL despite society conditioning us to never believe that."
"Well there was a recent test study regarding link between gay gene and preference over beauty http://archive.fo/B6o23#selection-205.184-205.322 - this genetical data could explain why gay people are very fixated with beauty in general."

"You know that feeling when you watch a great film or show and you have to kind of stop and contemplate afterwards instead of moving on mindlessly to the next thing? I always feel that way at the end of your videos. This one hit very close to home, it mirrors a lot of my inner turmoil when it comes to thinking about getting surgery done. I'm nowhere near that being a financially viable option, and many people tell me I don't need it, but I can't really reconcile the fact that I only feel quite right in a select few sets of circumstances and otherwise just worry about being perceived as manly or unattractive.   You are beautiful, by the way. It's hard to fight that compulsion to tear yourself apart, but hopefully you get a little closer day by day. I certainly hope I can get there myself one day."
"I literally can't get over how gorgeous you are"
"Wait you had plastic surgery? I can barely tell the difference, though that may be because I probably wouldn't be able to tell if my own family changed their appearance."

"If your serious and want brutal honestly I can give you an honest impression of your looks. I'm not lying and I have no motive to do so.  You look very feminine you looked feminine before FFS but this has made you look more feminine, We see you mostly in portrait however so I suspect your surgery altered your face in profile more so it's difficult for me to comment about that.  Prior to your FFS there were some slight 'masculine traits' but by my reading you were still placed firmly in the 'female' distribution for facial features.  Honestly if you are 'clocked' horrible term it's probably due to ques from your voice and was never from your face or body really... Your voice dose sound slightly 'synthetic' I know this is no fault of yours and it is a testosterone disfigurement, but when initially listening to you,  you do hear it... you quickly learn to move past it however and you stop noticing it's sound and accept it as natural for you. (This is how contra sounds) it's a distinctive voice when I hear you speaking on other streams ect.  Now stop worrying your pretty. And prettier than me.  If your curious I am one of those Graduate PHD girls I'm also a transgirl too although I did transition in my early 20's although now I'm the same age as you... In my case I don't ever ware makeup, nor did I get FFS (So good shout) when I see myself I rarely think I look 'good' I think I look 'Fine' or 'meh' most of the time. Honestly you are prettier than me.   When I first transitioned I was also swallowed up by a nervous anxiety to be 'pretty' for me this passed gradually over time as I found myself passing in social circumstances and my friends just accepted me as I was just an ordinary girl student at the time. I found myself valid thus I felt less of a push to make myself ever more 'feminine'.  When I see myself and I feel the insecurity you describe about being ugly or spotting the odd wrinkle or gray hair I will tell myself... 'It's fine that I'm not a pretty girl... I was designed to be utilitarian creature not a beautiful one...' trying to take pride in my intellect or technical skills When I put makeup on I feel like even slight makeup looks outrageously gaudy on me and it highlights everything I'm not by nature... it makes me paranoid about my appearance as it draws so much attention to my meh face to the point of feeling near dysphoria about it that I can nominally avoid.  Although yes I do feel envy when I see girls who have feminine attributes I desire and pine for myself... I choose to not devote alot of energy to trying to better my looks... Although that is probably a luxury I have that you don't because I don't have to look at myself more than one or twice a day. I'm sure if I had to analyse myself over and over I'd feel more anxious about my looks."

"I like the bit when you say to yourself in the mirror 'I have created beauty.' aS a TrAnS wOmAn, i relate to that sentiment a lot. When i feel really pretty I feel sort of proud, like 'damn, I did that!' Its the same feeling as when I make a piece of art I'm really proud of. Like in a way taking pills and stuff to make my body look a certain way, and and like you were talking about, my style, are not just an expression of myself, but an artistic expression of myself. and I assume getting ffs (which i dont currently plan to but w/e) would be like an extension of that. It's not 'fake,' but in a way its a more honest expression of oneself than just coping with how you look naturally. Btw you were already beautiful but your post ffs self looks amazing <3 and I know you talk about not beleiving your fans' flattery in the vid, but I truly believe you look wonderful and fem af"

"Ok now that I've finished watching the video here are my thoughts.   Natalie, your physical beauty is pretty undeniable IMHO. But the gushing comments you receive aren't inherently about that. The amount of beauty you've sent out into the world and inspired in other people, to be better, more empathetic, gentler souls, far outshines any personal aesthetic one individual could achieve. You simply make our world a better place. The ability to change minds and hearts, the appeal to the better angels of our nature, is transformative in a way no amount of surgery could ever be.   Outer beauty matters for all the reasons you've listed. But beauty without substance is just propaganda.   Yours is nourishing. It gives us the courage to face the ugliness of the world and these times we live in.   We love you, though we do not truly know you. Because you help us love ourselves and others. We selfishly love you for your selfless gift of beauty.   And for the mouthfeel. xD"

"Your post-FFS nose is really cute! But I mean both before and after your nose was nice either way. I’m sorry if that upsets you but you look nice no matter what and it’s good that your surgery went well"

"You are a bimbo poet. Loving ya"
"Hey, I'm going to remind you of something, girl - no matter what the internet says, your problems are still valid. Yes, you have it better than others. But that doesn't mean you also don't struggle, okay?"
"I loveeee the use of a SOPHIE song like omgg"
"i feel like natalie is the death grips of leftist youtube, everytime i watch a video of hers i feel like im being assaulted but im fucking loving it"
"I love the AHS vibe in the intro!  :)"
"You want sincerity? I think that, without any make-up, you look like a mom. So the make-up makes you look much younger, which is expected, it's the same for me. Aging is scary.   But you know what? I'm happy that you're here on youtube sharing your knowlegde and experience. You changed me a bunch since I found your channel, and I'm sure you also changed many more people much more. That's what I care about the most. I'm grateful to you and I hope you can feel better about yourself, that you can feel at peace. Because you deserve it. :)"

"I'm watching this with my baby kitten perched on my shoulder like a parrot."
"14:18 But you said the survey was only for cunnilingus experts???"
"I want you to know I really do think you're beautiful not because you want to hear it but because I think you are in body and in mind. You send the most beautiful messages out and are genuinely making the world a better place. You've Actually changed a lot of minds from harmful worldviews. And that is the most beautiful thing of all."
"'I am sooo fucking MOIST!'  looooool omg I lost my shit at that part lol  One of my favorite videos of yours, Nat.  So much truth lol"
"No. it doesn;t look better, but them i'm not you're demographic so Fuck you missy (love smoe of your videos BTW)"
"As a fat ciswoman, I've been thinking about this a lot lately too and came to a similar conclusion. I will never be beautiful, but fuck am I cute!"
"I adore you.   And you really are beautiful. ☺️🤗💕"
"America needs Contrapoints!"
"All hail the heteronormative female archetype"
"Intro-ing with a SOPHIE song hell yeah"
"I would love for you to touch on the 'Body Positivity' movement in a future video, especially as it has been co-opted by corporations, dominated by conventionally attractive able bodied white insta-influencers, and the ways it does and does not challenge social power structures through its individualized approach."
"10:47 When ContraPoints ceases being social commentary and becomes an ASMR channel."
"As a man I can confirm I was surveyed."
"Have you ever gone into the subject of cognitive dissonances?"
"Holy shit i've never found something that explained why i want to be pretty this relatable.... and holy shit that short blurb about girls in academia trying to be more masculine... man that was me a couple of years ago. Now, I'm an EECS major at Berkeley, which has some serious terrible stereotypes that mostly apply to guys and really hate how people can't believe the smart people can also be pretty :/"
"SHE GOT FFS"
"That skin care routine had me in stitches.  And then you hit us with the darkness."
"Okay all comments aside, that top is EVERYTHING."
"My favourite thing about Contrapoints videos is she puts together fragments of thoughts I've had for awhile into a whole coherent idea"
"You look *GREAT* hon"
"I can't believe you singlehandedly ended capitalism"
"Me, an nb lesbian: I AM straight chillin. I am wearing a denim dress, minimal makeup, my hair is completely plain, and my legs are starting grow hair back and I couldn’t be more comfortable with myself. You do you, my people!"
"'I feel like I'm Forgetting something... Like the guys who literally voted you to top ten. OK."
"I will just say that if you start doing sequin ASMR videos I'm totally going top-tier Patreon."
"This video was hard to get through, I cried during it. I'm so glad I saw the whole thing. Fuck."
"i think that you feel like you can't separate body disphoria and a simple need to be beautiful because womanhood and the need for others approval is so closely knighted we don't even know if the first exists without the second. at least i find it almost imposible to diferentiate. i feel like most women live depending on others view of them and, as awful as it sounds, i don't even know if it is in the womans brain or it is a construct. i don't really believe just accepting that need is what is needed, and just as we need a contrapoints more than a beauty guru, maybe we need more woman who decide not to be viwed as beautiful, at least not at all times. woman adapting to mans ways is obviously not the answer but some similitud will come with getting more freedom, and i believe the need to be viwed as beautiful at all times is part of the scilent opression, even if even cis man are doing it now because of socials media and the plural need to be flawless"
"You look lovely. I'm not sure how you'll feel about this, but the first video of yours I watched was the Incels one, and I had no idea you weren't a cis woman until you said you were trans. So, there's that."
"You look lovely! What's with the slightly dismissive note re: women who don't subscribe to beauty standards, though? My choice to wear little/no makeup is nothing to do with wanting to be taken seriously by men and everything to do with not wanting to be 'taxed' by crappy beauty standards designed to keep us feeling shit and buying shit. Fab if you enjoy make up and find it to be a fun form of self-expression, but what a waste of time and money if you don't?"
"'Once you get locked into serious skincare collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.' ... was that a *Salt Shaker half full of cocaine* reference!"
"I'm feeling a deep and unquenchable desire for contrapoints makeup tutorials   my mind has been opened as always but my heart wants the tutorials"
"Never wear any makeup (and not a grad student —yet). My mother is a lesbian (and a lawyer, so the intellectual type) and she used to tell me we both had “natural beauty” and that it I did not need makeup. I mostly focus on having good looking skin and the rest is perfectly fine. I am most definitely privileged; there is nothing about my face that I would change and people sometimes tell me I look like a model. If I was not already satisfied with my appearance, I would probably be learning all the tricks like the other girls do."

"As a creature torn screaming NIN lyrics from the bosom of the 80's & 90's kink scene, body mod is style, so it's actually hard for me to back off from seeing 'cosmetic surgery' as art; thus expressive, thus style. I even feel that a bit about 'pure vanity' work; and every time I hear a person's story, it's always more than one might assume. It doesn't have to be deep to be style. It has to be intentional and expressive. But it can, and often does run deep in it's power for the person expressing it. And as style can be about carving your identity into the unwilling facade of a normative society, it all feels like it can be an aspect of revolution. This was an amazing rollercoaster of things to think about. Thank you for everything you do, I feel like it's desperately needed, even if it is pulling you away from your other true G.G. Gorgeous-related destiny. Also as of writing this Happy World Goth Day all... (I did warn you all from whence I came...)"
"Omg I literally can’t even see the resemblance between the two pics profile shots, really happy for you"
"ThoughtSlime's video on white identity has ruined skulls for me and I'm not even mad"
"Natalie I'm begging you to become a beauty channel"
"As a trans male entering his second month of hrt, I am really jiving with this message of cultivating style and embodying the self before reflecting the standards. That being said, if I don't have a big arms and a strong jaw by the end of the week, I'm going to break something"
"Hello gorgeous 😍 you were always pretty anyway, nonetheless I'm glad you're more comfortable with your face now and you look amazing. Also that intro production 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽"
"You're looking fan-fucking-tastic. I apologize, sincerely because I do actually feel great shame but my crunk self has decided to share with the world: I occasionally get an inferiority complex because there are women who weren't born women and may not even be transitioning, but y'all look so much fucking better than I ever could. Over half the women in my cousin's show after parties were not born women, but goddamn did they make me question everything about sexuality."
"I’ve been thinking a lot about this lately- how do I fight the power while also figuring out what it means to take care of myself (to avoid burnout especially) and feel good about my appearance as a woman in *this society*. What I’m settling on for now is ‘practicing body kindness as a radical act of self care’ and just yelling that loudly to the haters when I feel like a foolish girl who’s shallow for tending to her appearance.  “FUCK YOU, THIS FACEMASK IS PRAXIS!”"
"oh ny GOD contra, don't listen to the HATERS, you are a *QUEEN* !1!!1! Every NIGHT, I PRAY to a MURAL of your FACE for 45 MINUTES , repeating 'yass queen slayy' OVER and OVER as I cradle a SKULL in my *COLD DEAD ARMS*"
"You look a little like Celine Dion"
"OPEN AN ASMR CHANNEL MOM PLS 😉🤣"
"Omg I adore you so much! 😍💖 (it's important you know that I wrote this comment when you gifted us with sequin ASMR 😂)"
"Omfug I just want a daddy dom and to service the dark lord, is that so much to ask?"
"Thank you so much Contra for this video, it made me feel so much better about myself and realize that when I choose carefully an outfit and my makeup and I feel great it is not just me being shallow but loving myself."
"You look beautiful contra!"
"You're so beautiful! ❤😭   I'm born female and ppl will ask me if I'm a man (I have a strong jaw, heavy eyelids/brows, and a prominent forehead). My sibling is a trans man, and ppl say I should've been the one to transition bc I already look like a man and he was so cute 'before'....😐 People are assholes. I'm definitely getting surgery when I can afford it!"
"I've never ugly laughed so hard about a video about beauty"
"Vendictive transexualism was going to be my summer look"
"one of the better things in life"
"You were gorgeous to begin with and have only gotten better. Love your videos: always clever, informative and worthy of repeat viewings.   P.S. those nails slap"
"16:20 okay MOOD"
"As always, phenomenal"
"I've said it once, so again, it's been like watching my tomboy friend grow up. That shirt, my daughter is going to love it."
"Who's floppy disk is assigned as path F: smh"
"This production value mama, don’t even try it"
"Starting the video with SOPHIE!!! I love you Natalie!"
"Jesus fucking christ Natalie. Ageing is literally the defining trait of laughter,, ujust calm the fuck down about it and dont lose that will to live. that's all she has. (but whatever)."
"This country really does need a Contrapoints. Your work is so important."
"Being really honest here. I found your change really strange at first, but then, as the video rolled, I get used to your new face and I gotta say, imo you really do look a lot more feminine."
"11:57 Girl... That didn't aged well"
"Nobody: Nobody at all: . . . Call of the void: Slice and peel your face off, you educated, happily married, plant Instagram whoring filth.  Idk why this episode hit me so hard."
"16:55 LOL for real! And... I wish I was a lesbian 🤭😂😘"
"Love your style, love your irony, love you."
"EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU IS BEAUTIFUL UWU <3<3<3"
"I wasn’t ready for that SOPHIE cameo"
"So FFS means Forced Feminization Surgery and not For Fucks Sake ... Interesting"
"As a lesbian, I am indeed straight chilling (well, gay chilling) and having dudes think I look diseased is actually a plus."
"Where did you purchase that shirt/blouse?  Asking for a friend, which is me."
"Just as a quick note, Explain to me please, as someone from the more right leaning garden variety, why is fatness, a display of Greed and Gluttony by only those who are inactive, well off or simply neglectful of themselves end up fat with no other exceptions to it, I do not understand why this is a hill that is seen as worth being defended. don't want to be fat? Eat less. It's far, far apart from the others. Not to mention people dislike it because it for lack of better terms virtues meaning to others, those who are fat show others their core 'values' or traits for lack of a better word, gluttony, lack of control, meaning more money to be spent on food, fatter children, less overall happy life. Again just far and a way different from the rest and shouldn't be included"
"It's simply cosmetic preference. I dye my hair and wear makeup, and I've had braces and injections just to look prettier. 😮  BTW I fvcking love the top, hoops, makeup and hair...can we get a products list pweeez 🙏🏻"
"Contrapoints continues to be relatable: I too have the dancing Pikachu video in my brain in place of serotonin molecules."
"…Wait why am I not in the credits I’m a $20 Patron"
"How the fuck does Natalie make 30 minutes feel like 5 minutes?"
"Audio is off by a couple milliseconds"

"Was that a little kishi bashi 👀"
"the SECOND I heard Sophie playing I  d i e d"
"That intro is fire. <3"
"Countdown 'till Contra disappears from YouTube has begun."
"Cis woman speaking, but I can relate to your  idea of “passing”.  I’ve suffered from anorexia and I often find myself if I can “pass” as thin. So much so that thin and beautiful are practically identical in my mind."
"whoever came up with skin-maxing is a fucking genius, please show me where they are"
"hard same on the dancing pikachu thing"
"Whoa! Around 9:55 is something that irked me about the speaker I had at my commencement ceremony this weekend. She said how she 'traded in her skirt and blouse for jeans and a sweatshirt' when talking about mysoginy in the Biological Sciences department of the University. I was sitting there like 'But why would you have to do that? That's not fair.' She seemed to take it as a moment of pride relinquishing her 'feminine attire.' I hope I'm not overthinking this."
"16:06 Ouch I feel targeted.. Well I guess I was always told I'd make a better door than a window... (That is mid-west for 'you're in the way, hoe') Love you, Nat!! Keep being awesome"
"So beautiful: both in the way that matters, and also on the inside. <333"
"I think I mention how much I love this absolute goddess twenty times a week"
"Rachel she FUCKING DID IT"
"I'm so thankful I'm confortable being bald and slanky and hairy, I'm fine being ugly... all that surgary sounds really painful."
"Me: 'Oh I don't do much skincare' Also Me: 'Slathers on retinol and scream cries to Enya'"
"Great video Natalie. I'm sorry for breaking your gendered generalizations, I'll go back to my nonbinary cave."
"The first video of yours that I clicked on was the incels one and I just thought you were an awesome campy hot girl if that makes any difference. I didnt clock you."
"'Once you get locked in to a serious skin care collection...' Fear and Loathing in Baltimore? ;)"
"Girl you is that BITCH 😍💁🏽‍♀️And that’s just period 🤷🏽‍♀️"
"I really appreciate the message about personal style. I have a lot of issues with my body and comparing myself to others, and I really needed to hear that. 🤘🏻"
"A thoughtful, nuanced narrative. Appreciated. For what the opinion of this decidedly straight whiteboy is worth, you were strikingly attractive before and this recent surgery has only enhanced that. Far more importantly, you seem pleased and comfortable with it."
"cishet culture is creating dumb slang for things trans people have discovered before you"
"I need to know what eyeshadow you used because they are beautiful. We demand a tutorial!"
"Do you have a penis?  Doesn't matter to me.  Just wondering because I like chicks with dicks."
"This video was incredible. That intro is something I would expect from a high budget Netflix series."
"Great video... I hope you do whatever brings you Joy, Natalie. I'm gonna try to do the same!"
"When it comes to lesbians straight chilling, they do seem to be the least obsessed with traditional good looks and more about redefining beauty. Maybe style already has set the lesbians free ;)"
"Ok i wrote a mean comment and i stand by it but also the last bit of this with the style over beauty stuff is a huge step up from some things you've said and done in the past, so congrats, I'm proud of you. I still think you're a terrible influence and it's deeply unfortunate you've become the sole voice of trans people on the internet, but if you keep on this path of self-improvement you might end up being a half decent one."
"so excited to hear the truth... of your journey... in this vulnerable moment"
"Sophie?"
"8:48  BOTTOM TEXT"
"Ya scared me at 26:00.  Thought you were retiring."
"Love the unironic phrenology bit. You should write for Quillette!"
"Congrats on the surgery. You look great. And your brain is still first-rate."
"You're pretty. Point blank"
"Nathalie, to answer your very specific question, you're not pretty enough for Instagram; In fact, no human is. That's why god gave us Photoshop, so we could shuffle off this fugly fugly mortal coil to become worthy of that purest form of beauty - Instagram"
"Scraping your nails against your sequins is the closest I've ever been to being satisfied by ASMR"
"Natalie, you are so obviously beautiful. My brother thought so before knowing you or knowing you're trans, true story.  This video is excellent as always :)"
"watching her crack herself up is the wholesomeness a i am here for.Plus all the deep thoughts to i guess, I.D.K."
"ive been wanting ffs for over a decade but ill never afford it. i dont care about looking beautiful i just want to look female."
"6:39 at least in south korea, if one’s plastic surgery looks like it is mimicking western features, it’s seen as artificial and in poor taste. the more expensive surgeries attempt to accentuate “natural” korean features.  source: https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1357034X12440828"
"Yeet"
"thanks for wearing clothes, cuz otherwise this video might have been taken down and that would really suck. Glad you are back."
"Soo the intro ended like 9 minutes in ?"
"This is the first time I've seen any trans person with a platform (or really any trans person at all) be honest about the goal of transition. Yes, we want to pass, but we also want to be beautiful. Why ELSE would we have tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of work done on our bodies? Natalie's the first trans person I've come across that doesn't blow sunshine up your ass and try to act like everything they do transition-wise is Empowering(TM) OR do that thing that terminally unique Tumblrinas do where any and every attempt to look beautiful by the standards of society is selling out or counterrevolutionary.    I've caught flack in both online and meat space transmasculine circles for wanting FMS (facial masculinization surgery, the opposite of what Natalie had) because in moooooooooost transmasc circles, anything beyond top surgery is regarded as this extreme measure that means you must have something wrong with you at a deep psychological level beyond simple, well-known chest dysphoria. Sadly, the only person I can really be honest with is my cis female best friend. I can't really be 100% honest in any trans circle about the fact that at the end of all of this, I don't want to just 'pass,' I want to be beautiful. I want to be the man that all the other fags are jealous of when I walk into a room, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that, especially not after two decades of being derided for my looks, both before and after starting transition. If I'm going to have $200k-$300k worth of work done to my body, and go through ungodly amounts of pain, why wouldn't I want to come out of all of it beautiful?    Thanks for your honesty, Natalie, I can't even begin to tell you how fucking refreshing it is."
"this perfectly summarized what it feels like"
"“Get out of my room mom!”  You made be ugly laugh."
"Not feeling beautiful despite being told you're beautiful and being beautiful is the story of every cishet woman I've dated. You're doing great?"
"I can choke myself just fine, thank you.  You are beautiful though."
"A literal queen."
"yes sis speak for us trannies lmao"
"Do you only actually work only 60 hours a month?"
"Great video, glad you're back, and you look stunning. You mouth is weird, different and oddly hypnotizing."
"I work at Dairy Queen, and I would never misgender you <3"
"you put in the most fucking work in order to have the best production quality of any  youtuber on this platform i FUCKING SWEAR. fucking slay mom"
"Your videos are always so well done and creative visually and content-wise!"
"This is so funny! But helpfull. And you look like Celine Dion. I like her so... Choke me!!!"
"Plz where is the dress (maybe it is a top) from? I must buy it"
"28:42 ’You should be thankful I’m wearing clothes at all.’ I am most certainly not."
"🙏 More power to you!! ❤️"
"Again, your beauty  both within and on the surface have me agog."
"I feel like whenever one of these vids features a skull it's allways good shit :) <3"
"the way makeup and editing apps can cover the flaws of my face is exactly why i stopped using them quite so often. i still wear makeup (when i'm bored, for special occasions, or just for fun some days because why not) because i love doing makeup but i refuse to edit pictures aside from the infrequent use of a filter. i just find that the more i cover up my natural 'flaws', the more i get used to a 'flawless' face, and the more i hate how i actually look. if other people want to wear makeup and edit their pics all the time that's totally fine, if it makes them happy i will never be the person to tell them to stop, but for me personally moving away from those things has been really beneficial. i still hate my face, but less now."
"Ooff. Too real. As a 'bro'-ey lady mess your spot on about the need to mimic masculinity to feel like youll be taken seriously. But at the same time i do aprecieate astheticly how i look when i fem it up. Then i feel bad. Both for looking masc ( dont be lazy) and for looking fem (arogant b*). And i think a lot of us get caught in this trap where 'self love' can be another stick to beat ourselves with.  Its pretty twisted. And yeah people just critiquing the system kind of doesnt give practicle support or change. Apart from improving yourself. Ew.  But great job! Whats the point in comfortable philosophy?"
"I'm a non-binary guy so can I not die tomorrow? I kind of have plans."
"That intro make me think about American Horror Story"
"3:21 I feel so damn ugly right now. Your old side profile is similar to mine (I’m a cisgender female), and no offense to old you (you weren’t and aren’t ugly), but damn, this makes me feel........ manly...... I want plastic surgery even more now if I can look like THAT......... That jawline..... that brow..... 😭"
"I just saw a video about a famous actress. (Old time 'Star' from screen & radio.) Ethyl Merman maybe?  You sound like her. Are you copying her voice? (I just heard her on an old-time radio theater show in NYC.)"
"“It’s hard being a six” Can relate."
"couldn't help but start this with a smile when I heard sophie"
"Can you get on Twitch already so we can raid the heck out of you? The gamerbois need to be shepherded your way."
"Love your biological sequins"
"You look nice Natalie :)"
"contra,,,, i fucking love u"
"Holy crapsicles. Thank you for articulating some things that I've been trying to wrestle with... but failing because I'm reluctant to confront my own ageing face and contradictory thoughts on beauty and value."
"Ask autistic people.  We will not lie to you.  You're pretty."
"I’ve watched that intro like 20 times"
"Make-up is incredibly bourgeois."
"I about screamed when Sophie started playing at the beginning"
"I'm convinced at this point that you're just trying to turn this channel into a creepy aesthetic horror show on netflix"
"you always looked beautiful and your contribution to society is more than just your appearance."
"except for the fact im not a transgender woman i relate 100% with this video thank youuuu very much"
"Woah."
"You look like a young celine dion..."
"I'm pretty sure the theme for the last 5 minutes is remixed minecraft music"
"Fantastic usage of Eric Satie. I could listen to the Gymnopedies all freaking day."
"I'm bummed about the many paths to artifice that are available these days. Make up, digital stuff, surgery, they all spoil the information we could otherwise gain from physical form"
"damn natalie right after i buy those nail skin hair biotin gummies"
"First Louis Vuitton, now one of my fave YouTubers! I love the use of “Faceshopping” by SOPHIE!!!YAASSS👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼"
"holy shit natalie stans sophie  it's a match made in heaven"
"Omg yaaaaaas. I needed this so bad! Dysphoria has been kicking my ass and the people around me have been so invalidating! I needed to hear this. Love you girl! All hail the queen! ❤❤❤"
"Song at 14:00 ??? Really recognise it!"
"Im very high I don't know how I ended up watching this but congratz u look nice for a trap lol"
"Oh my nipples"
"I really needed to hear this today. Thanks."
"Natalie...you are beautiful, however if you’re having trouble thinking it’s true...know that your thoughts create your reality. Try looking in the mirror and telling yourself “I love you!” Your body etc will then act accordingly. The 70% water inside of us knows what we say to ourselves....I’m sure you know about the infamous water crystal experiments done by the Japanese scientist Dr. Emoto. See the Quietest Revolution’s video on it. She’s my age, 42, and looks SO young it’s insane! Watch her and check out the results of telling yourself that you love yourself and you are beautiful! I hope you read this. I L❤️VED this video by the way...💋"
"MOTHER!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am abashed at the overwhelming radiance of your perfection!!!!! Even relentless time will stay its marauding ravages to gaze eternally upon your unprecedented beauty!!!!! You are sacred muse to a generation and yours will be the countenance ascribed to angels, even long after all else that now is has passed from recollection!!!!! ... And... I'd put stuff in you because you look good!!!"
"SOPHIE"
"I literally stopped wearing makeup to avoid getting catcalled & harassed because it just Stops Happening when I'm not trying to look nice. BUT I WANNA LOOK NICE. Fuck you men who think we wear it for you. We don't, shut up."
"Oh wow Sophie"
"I mean we can argue if the garage door eye shadow counts as style... Just kidding. Great video about a pretty extensive topic. I hope you gonna revisit some of the more complex points at a later date.   Never stop having fun with makeup. That's what it's meant for."
"*No one feels beautiful.* The pursuit of achieving that relies on external validation and ultimately consists of nothing but vanity and misplaced relevance, probably as a half-conscious attempt to shoot the breeze as long as we have the privilege to distract ourselves with superficiality."
"'Once you get locked into a serious skin care collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.' I am dead"
"It makes me sick hearing about this self mutilation. I don't care who anyone is, plastic surgery is very unattractive."
"I see that Vicious hairspray can in the back! Natalie needs an R+Co sponsorship deal, stat."
"Hang out with old people."
"I will stop caring about my appearance when I pass to the random drunk guys catcalling women on the street corner."
"#notalldaddydoms"
"You are so gorgeous!!!! ❤️  I’m 100% gay but from time to time I’ll see a woman and think that I would absolutely smash that if I were straight. Usually for me it’s not even the drop dead gorgeous women but the ones who stand out in some way. I thought of you in much the same way even before this video.  So, definitely sew them individual styles and see what that reaps."
"It's really amazing. you achieved the goal, you but more feminine. the surgeon is very good."
"Well, I've never been one to go after glitz and glamour, so to me, you can chase your ideals of beauty all you want, you will always be Natalie Wynn. A pioneer in understanding transgender people."
"hot chick talks about big brain stuff. 10/10 would bang"
"congrats on ffs! interesting vid as ever and really fantastic choice of song lol. Whilst I think it's certainly true that the line between gender affirming and cosmetic procedures can be much less clear cut than the woke script would allow us to discuss it's interesting to me to compare to my own experiences and desires as a trans masculine person which are largely contradictory. In my personal experience my desire for medical transition is in no way a desire for beauty, and my desire for top surgery IS very much medical - not just for psychological reasons but physical one's too as binding is a daily discomfort and risk to my body.  In fact my major transition goal is to be able to express myself through the style I wish without it causing me to be misgendered"
"Man can't wait until i have FFS."

"Men 160% prefer women with just a bit of makeup (the natural 'look' not actual natural skin - which is flawed as shit.) I've spent years thinking about this shit. I have a journal entry on Fetlife about beauty standards and trying to embrace style as a concept.   It's literally painful to admit that looks/beauty/aesthetic matters to you when you're entire life people tell you that 'it's what's in your heart that matters', and 'personality always outweighs looks.' They're obviously lying! I've spent years making money off my perceived beauty. I've watched beautiful people out in the world get more attention, more jobs, more kindness, etc. It's a statistical fact. I've spent tens of thousands of dollars on treatments and products, all while simultaneously abhorring this culture of beauty and utterly feeling trapped by it.  The.struggle.is.real."
"Is it possible to offer up a sincere comment when you've been made acutely aware of the parasocial disconnect you have with someone you only know from social media?     You've come a long way from dunking on fundies with the 'New Atheist' movement (or whatever you want to call them), most of whom in the long term turned out to be Old Reactionaries. Your eloquence and candour really are something else. With your philosophical background you already understand what it means to be beautiful more than most, and I wish you every success at another thing you've set your mind on achieving.     Best wishes, and thanks for all the videos."

"I'm constantly astounded by how articulate you are. A lot of the points you made represent exactly how I feel – I love makeup, I love using it for self expression, but the whole argument of the beauty community about 'I do it for me!! Myself!!!' feels somewhat shallow and lacking in context. Also, watching this made me realize some of my own internalized misoginy: I remember your video on Incels showing up repeatedly on my recommended page and me ignoring it because it was made by a woman with loads of makeup on and I thought that meant somehow it wouldn't be as deep/well-researched or whatever. I only gave you a shot when my brother mentioned you came from the Academia and I only properly respected you after finding out you're trans (white cis woman = stupid?). Not as clockable as you think you are, I guess, and I'm not as #woke as I gave myself credit for."

"Personally I think my only hope is a transhumanist future happens where people have maximum control over themselves. I don't think my concerns are mainly aesthetic they are about impracticable amounts of power I can exert. For me, being the buff super tall masculine ideal is appealing but really its the power over others and over myself that is the most appealing. A 6 pack isn't going to get me laid, its a signal that I have my impulses under control and that control and that power attracts others to give ME, the choice of what happens in future social situations. So when brain implants and replacing muscles with cold steel happens I will be more than willing to get rid of my weak flesh bod. If it meant that everyone in the world would find me hideous but I had tremendous power over myself and could exert power then I would take that deal in a heartbeat."

"Society is pretty ugly tbh. Conta and her fans  are pretty as heck. Have a nice day y'all."
"it makes sense that not wanting to look like the Burgeoning ™ trans woman caricature lines up with mainstream beauty standards - terfs may identify as feminists, but when they talk about trans women looking like men, they tend to rely on traits considered 'ugly' on women. i'm a cis woman, and i've been accused of being trans before when i've had popular anti-terf posts on tumblr. you know why? my dark body hair, my thick eyebrows, my big nose, just my face in general apparently??? and, of course, my inept and uneven performance of femininity. they desire to restrict womanhood from everyone they can, and i am, proudly, defiantly, unwillingly, the wrong kind of woman."

"From my small test sample I say that lesbians are too worried about their boobs to be straight chilling"
"I relate so much to this. I had several cosmetic procedures years ago and I've barely talked about it with anyone.   When I was in my early twenties i saved up and took out a line of credit to get multiple surgeries in Mexico. I got derision from friends and family who knew, because I should 'know better' than to care so much. That I was 'fine' as I was (though, never good, never handsome, because I wasn't.)   I was secretly hoping that the surgery would change me as a person, that I would suddenly switch from being the quiet self-loathing anxiety-ridden boy that I was, into a confident people-person. I did change for the better, and I'm happy with my results (for the most part. i've had to spend time and money fixing a few fuckups/scars.) But most of the time I just feel unsure about myself, and I still have debt from the surgeries. I'm less miserable than I was, but still not happy. There's more I would change if I could.   And even when I do feel attractive, and other attractive people tell me so, there's a part of me that doesn't feel right, because my experience of growing up as a below average-looking person shaped me psychologically, and those deep psychological issues aren't touched by surgery. And if i'm on a date with an attractive person, in the back of my mind I do kind of resent them for their privilege, and the fact that they probably wouldn't have gone to the trouble of meeting me if I hadn't had so much work done."
"natalie you can kill my entire family and i would feel honored."
"I used to say the same to my female friends and girlfriends. That makeup and wanting to look pretty is selfish, sick and stupid. But with time I learned that is cool that they enjoy their person, that we all (females and males) have little time with the flour of our youth and good lookin. So we can all agree that is better to look at this habits not just as an ego thing, but rather to a way of love ourselves. At the end we're all heading to the darkness and before that we reach grayville where everyone is just old and ugly. So fuck it. Be beatiful, Natalie. Love you!"

"As a cis woman I recently learned via snapchat feminizing filter that my jawline is too masculine and i have spent the last 3 days worrying about it and contouring my jaw. *B O N E  S T R U C T U R E*"
"I think you looked beautiful before and after. I think that women have been told that they are beautiful but they can't see it in them self so they do what they can to be beautiful. And now more than ever men are being told to be masculine and shown what masculine is and men that don't fit into the mould dont have the same tools that women have had. But I think in 50 years men will have their skin routines and beard contouring."

"Please more biological sequins ASMR."
"Look good either way...people would still accept you for who you are regardless (assuming they are reasonable people). You will however naturally feel the need for cosmetics more so than most cis women because of the biological makeup you had at birth. I would say a woman is a person and as such does not need to conform to any beauty standards. Wear makeup, don't wear makeup. Chip away at your forehead or grow a massive fucking beard. Whatever makes you feel good tbh ( as long as girls don't feel compelled to follow in an unrealistic example you intentionally reinforce)."

"I always had a pretty good image of myself for the most part, I was pretty much happy with how I looked at all times unless I was on my period. But then last year I realised I needed to lose weight as my BMI was overweight and I hadn't been paying attention to what I was eating. So I lost the weight pretty easily over 6 months. But after that I had to completely rekindle my body positivity because staring in the mirror looking for progress with my weight loss was making me analyse what needed to be changed about my body and what I didn't like just as much as I was noticing improvements.  I found what was best for me was to spend as much time in front of the mirror as possible, NOT analysing, just getting used to how I look. Not editing or thinking about editing. It can also help to take lots of pictures of yourself or film yourself a lot without trying to look good with makeup etc. And then I just started to really like how looked again, I guess I also worked on loving myself mentally too. But I started to get a happy boost when I looked in the mirror in the morning because I really liked how I looked.  I wish I had better advice but that's all I have"

"@ContraPoints Do what makes you feel good! But i would object to the claim that representation really makes you feel feminine. I think this is something you tell yourself to fight off the void, which is ofcourse a fine thing to do. But I think the true beauty of your person & personality shines within these videos and characters you share with the world. It is already externalized and that is fine. Sex & Gender is a hoax like everything in this universe, which was designed by some mad demon god. It does not need to be overcompensated by the beauty industry. You made me realize that i too had a woman in my head, sitting within a mans body, who is not really happy. Your Gender Dysphoria video transformed my understanding of myself. I looked back at art i made and things i have done in a new light (https://www.deviantart.com/leoraven/art/A-lovely-couple-censored-537409269). I still do not change my appearance at all, i'm quite a cis-man on the outside. Though in my written and drawn worlds as well as roleplay videogames i often am a woman as an avatar to explore my dreams. As silly as that sounds. Maybe i'm closeted. Probably i'm your opposite. Maybe i'm fake. I just do not think it is very healthy to look at beauty the way you expressed it in this video. You try to frontload your insecurity that again reminds me of myself. Just don't let that frontloading break you like it did break me. You are already immortal within these artful videos which in themselves have inspired countless others. Don't fear age."
"the part about style made me happy. fuck passing, i'm a faceless hypermodernist anarchist nerdbitch hexagram entity!"

"You used to talk about politics and philosophy. Now you make boring videos about your personal neuroses."
"You know when I first saw your video over a year ago I had no idea you were a “trans” but I think you look beautiful and I adore you. Keep doing you darling ☺️"
"I gotta say, as a guy, women's desire to look good 'for themselves' is absolutely mystifying to me. When I put any effort into my appearance (which is not often) it is 100% solely to look attractive to other people. I don't know if it's just because I refuse to cultivate any sort of healthy self identity, but I've never understood it. I mean I believe it, but it's very foreign to me."
"You are BEAUTIFUL, and your face is fine too. (I think you look a lot like Physics Girl, actually)"
"i genuinely screamed when i saw you posted again. thank u."
"You are seriously so beautiful"
"knowing that there's a billion industries exploiting our desires to look beautiful to sell products, really does influence me to avoid going down that rabbit hole. living under the thumb of my mother, who would fat-shame me and just shame me in general for not conforming to beauty standards growing up, taught me that people become warped by this shit. and i'll do anything not to support this construct.   it is only as an adult now that i feel safe exploring beauty and makeup because i feel as if i won't be forced into something anymore, since i have control over my life. i can choose to engage in beautifying myself or not as i please. because of that, for about 3 months i wore makeup every day, but the riptide of school and work took over my life and now i dont remember the last time i wore makeup. part of me would love to dedicate more time to creating my own unique style, and challenge beauty standards. but i simply don't have the time. and i guess that's where i stand with beauty as of right now.   also u couldn't have picked a better intro song"
"The 'I'd Clock me' scene was fucking adorable"
"Post-surgery depression is a really normal possibility after almost any surgery, so there is something physiological going on there too. But you're right, we've gotta catch our mental patterning up with our actually gorgeous selves, either way."
"The comparison of FFS surgery for trans women and double eyelid surgery for Asians is not only kinda transphobic as you said, but kinda racist too, because accusing Asian women of internal racism for wanting the surgery is basically implying that they want to look white, which is categorically untrue. These beauty ideals existed before many of the countries with prominent eyelid surgery culture even had seen white people at all. It's more about rarity of features than anything else - in pretty much any culture, features that are relatively rare among the genetic population (symmetrical and, well, not disfigurements at least) are what are considered the standard of beauty. Double eyelids are relatively uncommon among East Asians, and so they became a symbol of beauty due to this rarity.  This is also part of the reason why the colourism towards darker skinned people exists across Asia, while white people strive to be more tanned."
"I bloomed for a few years, and my appearance went to Hell.  I think, in your class, that they don't make an effort to look beautiful because it's distracting, and they're in a field with a lot of men who will car talk them if they're cute or beautiful. They won't be respected for what they care about. I had this issue in the army."
"Wow it looks good! Why do you looks like Jenna marbles"

"A new Contrapoints video and a new Lindsay Ellis video in the same week?! Doesn't get better"
"Excellent video as always! I'm really glad you made this one because it gets at something I've been thinking about for a while: how dysmorphia interacts with and confounds dysphoria. Put another way, do I hate my breasts because they represent fat or because they represent femininity? I honestly can't tell most of the time, and I'm terrified of admitting it because it seems like what trans people go through is only considered valid if it can be completely divorced from things that society considers vain, like body dysmorphia and eating disorders. But the reality is a lot messier than that; as you mentioned in your video, we are trying to conform to societal standards just as much as we are trying to align our presentation with our gender identities."

"'My nose is no longer busted the house' OMG I went back and played it again hahahahahh"
"Came for the sequins, stayed for the everything else in the video"
"as a lesbian, I can confirm I'm just straight chillin'. But I am butch af and like presenting more masculine than feminine."
":-*"
"OooOOooOO 4K! Finally I can get some use out of this damn 4K television that I strictly use for watching YouTube and absorbing opinions on films that I haven’t even watched."
"Where did you get this amazing TOP!?!! I NEED IT!"
"Foppington got you down?"
"Am I the only one who noticed the facial surgery immediately, before she mentioned it?  Also that fucking intro was flames jfc."
"I love you, and YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL."
"'Isn't it safer to just fall in love with them, while quietly dying inside'.  That's so well put.  Thank you for your talent and your beauty.  The surgery turned out great.  Im a 'sis' male who doesn't struggle with sexual identity issues, like - at all.  However, I really enjoy your videos.  They are well produced and remind me of great directors from the 90s and 80s.  Great job!  I appreciate your boldness and vulnerability and lack of pretention."
"10:43 omg biological sequin asmr ftw"
"We are not worthy, Dark Mother. My humble personage bows before your grandeur You could wield all six Infinity Stones"
"Natalie everyone unfortunately is the worst judge of Him/Herself. Get well soon! :)"
"I sometimes think trans folks belive we 'straights' are super happy with our body, or at least 'happier'."
"You slay me darling. You deff on fleek, keep up the great content!"
"Girl, I'm just glad you're back. Also, you look pretty fly for a white girl Srsly though"
"YOU LOOK AMAZING NATALIE 💓 and great video once again (I would never expect anything less)"
"I've been told plenty of times in my life that I'm a conventionally attractive person, but I don't believe it except once in a while. Being pretty was super important to me for a long time. Lately it has been less important, but I've been sick. Anyway I just wanted you to know you're not alone."
"Oh god more skull stuff"
"This is why we all need to ditch our flesh prisons and become amorphous blobs"
"_'Women in male-dominated fields sometimes feel like they have to present more masculine to be taken seriously.'_ Oh mood. If we ignore for a second the gigantic mess that is my gender identity, I've definitely felt the weird academia pressure to not be so very femme. I conformed to it too for a while. I didn't use makeup, wear my contacts, wear 'feminine' clothes, and even had short hair for a while. Until I realized that I was actually doing what women and nonbinary femme folk get accused of doing when we are 'too' feminine: I was dressing for other people. So I said fuck it and now stuffy old men in Anthropology departments can just learn to deal with the fact that I paint my lips with the blood of my enemies and my eyelids are sparkly. #Style  Oh and I definitely cracked up at the _'You guys are getting in the way of my crudely stereotyping people based on gender so...how dare you'_ comment. Adore these videos and damn I wish healed from surgery as well as you have. I looked like I had been punched in the face repeatedly by John Cena the first time I had my septum straightened. Then I really did get punched in the face so now they have to fix it again."
"Contra, you're a wonderful person, and assuming you aren't changing who you are *solely* for other people, there really are no wrong ways to choose to look. Continue being you."
"You look great Natalie, and your hair is friggin great in this video!!!"
"As a cis woman with a prominent brow bone, Real Self only suggests FFS as the surgery I would need and that toootally helps with the dysphoria."
"You're honestly my number 1 favorite YouTuber!! I am so glad you're back 😍❤️ Great video as always!!! Love you queen 😘"
"With lots of your other videos, I like them because they taught me something new about a topic that I wasn’t previously knowledgeable, or opened my eyes to an issue I hadn’t considered before. So what I love about this one is I went into it thinking I already knew all there was to know about beauty standards. I’ve been consuming feminist messages about the concept of beauty for lots of my life, and it often feels like an issue that people have already covered time and time again. Needless to say I didn’t think I would find this video as enlightening or as informative as I did. I feel like I’ll have to rewatch it a few more times to properly absorb everything, because there’s just so much in here. Thank you, Natalie!"
"Love the Death Grips homage during the intro."
"Sis you look just as gorgeous, but you went from mistress to girl next door. I love you. Thank you for sharing your journey! <3"
"Natalie is so self-aware."
"Oh we staaan"
"Choke me mmmy"
"I’m not emotionally prepared to watch this rn but I wanted to click it anyways to give you that sweet sweet engagement"
"Ok not the first watch of your videos but hey I gave you money to continue doing what your doing so please continue what your doing. Just please don't abuse your power."
"You look smart"
"Hm, I kinda disagree with Contra here. I went through this phase in high school, then I got married and grew up and now I only do basic grooming. No makeup or hair styling. I focus on my craft, my work, my passions in life. Beauty just stopped mattering at all when I did that. I don't think it's necessarily a female issue, I think it's just that women are obsessed with it because they believe it's where their value comes from. When you realize your value can come from your skills, your craft, your love, your personality, or other attributes, beauty stops mattering. I hope we can get to a society where that's what matters most (I realize that may be a utopian pipe dream)"
"Fuckin sophie is the shit"
"Contra you're my favourite cam-girl"
"THE KWEEN IS BACK YAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS"
"You're my version Gigi, you look straight🔥🔥!!"
"I wear makeup (rarely) because society expects me to. Going into a job interview without it makes me seem unkempt."
"Natalie thinks that I don't actually want her to choke me ;("
"Raw honesty: seeing you behind the mirror (sans makeup?) gave me a jolt of attraction I only rarely experience seeing girls."
"You are so beautiful inside and out. Please don't hate me for my corny sincerity.💋"
"That Sophie song at the beginning made this a perfect video"
"Oh god the faceshopping in the beginning HIT ME."
"Dang, you look amazing!!!"
"Not to get all parasocial on you, but the results really do look great!  Congrats on the successful surgery."
"relatable content"
"So then, Is style aesthetic stoicism?"
"omg SOPHIE in the intro... I didn’t think it was possible to love you more"
"I'm confused by your nose. Figured it out.  I'm an old hag. But if you have the money, fix the nose.  Don't vomit when you look at my photo.  I'm being honest, not mean."
"I'm living for your content!"
"U LOOK F******* STUNNING GURL"
"I will not stand for how toned-down Lady Foppington’s lewks are getting..."
"I hope you feel better Natalie. I am glad you're staying true to your goals 🌱 You're just one person, and I worry because you put so much pressure on yourself. Please don't forget your personal bill of rights 💚 Love you"
"I think being a lesbian does certainly give you more freedom from convential beauty. When you realize you're a lesbian you feel no need or desire to conform to the patriachal beauty standards set out. You are more free to be yourself as you don't care how the patriarchy defines beauty because you want to please women as a woman. At least that is my experience anyways. When I figured out I was a lesbian I honestly never felt more free from what society expects of you."
"Hmm... Gandolph the Grey would still have to stand on the bridge."
"Natalie is fucking beautiful!"
"“It’s hard being a six” truer words have never been spoken. I think you were beautiful before FFS and you’re beautiful after. You just seem more sure of yourself now. I love the aesthetic of your videos, thanks for sharing with us!"
"Thanks for the videos I love you."
"19:42 the meta"
"Her face when she discovered the ASMR properties of her outfit. Me too, girl, me too"
"This video attacked me personally tbh. aS a TrAnS mAn I've been thinking about where my desire to pass and my desire to be an 'attractive' man meet, and how to tell the difference between them. I've been pretty much exclusively read as a cis man for a few years now, and did have a year of total stealth. But I've always felt like a sort of 'failed' transition, because there's a very specific aesthetic of trans man who gets treated as attractive, and that's the skinny bodybuilder type. I'm... very average looking. Little chubby, reasonably cute face, solid 6/10. I do pretty much 100% pass, but I still feel like my appearance (and by extension, transition) is sub-par because I'm not a very easily consumable type of conventionally attractive.    I'd like to pretend that I'm definitely going to work through this and realise that tHe ReAl BeAuTy WaS mE aLl AlOnG, but like I'm definitely not. I literally watched this video while lifting weights and downing a protein shake, and the only reasons I haven't had FMS yet (which is a thing, btw. Rarer than FFS, but it is a thing) are money, and because trans men who are aware of it as a thing generally treat wanting it as something shameful + to be worked through, so it's hard to find info"
"just wanted to let you know that your beauty is in your brilliance. you look very good as well, but beauty transcends look in my opinion."
"Im real when I shop my face."
"Holy crap, this music is INCREDIBLE. Shout out to Zoe Blade, what a genius."
"I just realized who you remind me of now! Blaire/juicystar07? You look beautiful!"
"Final Fantasy S. I'm the one who came up with it..."
"I felt queezy watching this :/ Cant listen to people talking about surgery/blood"
"I started watching this, paused, made popcorn, continued watching."
"9 seconds in and bubbling with joy because Sophia + Contra everything. I'm gonna go back to the video now."
"No hay subtítulos 😭😭😭"
"Once again complete sense is talked and education given . Thank You Nat ."
"I'm Gay because I miss Contra as a Twink"
"Nice Gymnopedies credits song!"
"Watching an old ContraPoints video and a new one pops up when you're done: Priceless"
"Nothing like opening YT and finding a fresh (less-than-10-minutes-old fresh) ContraPoints upload 😍Natalie, I know you'll still stew over how you look, but as an (enby-ish) AFAB autistic who doesn't mince words or do pointless flattery: you look very pretty, your nose is cute, and you look objectively more feminine than me.   P.S. The autistics are largely chilling with the lesbians on the beauty front. My personal aesthetic goals are (a) clear skin and (b) minimal autoimmune inflammation puffiness (because that shit makes my eyes look like I've been bawling for hours, and then people ask what's wrong, and then I have to talk to them, and they won't believe that nothing's wrong because apparently allistic people like to say 'nothing' when they mean 'something' ugggghhhhhh)."
"You never cease to amaze me"
"Whoever peeled your face off your skull did a fantastic job. Stunning! *italian chef’s kiss*"
"not content in being gorgeous you are damn smart too, when I grow up I wanna be like you"
"No joke, the accidental ASMR section was so audibly and visually satisfying. Glittery snaps. My brain is happy."
"Natalie, thank you for making school bearable and inspiring me to actually do things. And love you!"
"Can confirm that lesbians are just straight chillin"
"I'LL DIE FOR YOU"
"that sequin asmr tho"
"*VORE ME CONTRA*"
"Contra's videos just keep getting more and more artistic, and I'm so down for it!"
"Oh my god this is so dope"
"You are overlooking that women compete with each other for status as females! Boys get into fist fights & sports over dominance. Women get into fashion & beauty! Capitalism just exploits the situation because that's what capitalism does. Maybe socialism or communism would handle it differently. But as you observed earlier, women, in prison, make their own beauty products out of whatever is at hand.  Elite status women will always wish to display their elite status and mid-tier & lower tier women will copy their style! (I just saw an article which claimed that Kate Middleton just changed the style of skinny jeans for the summer!)"
"Wow. Amazing video and ya look great girl. Your profile is👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻"
"I hear there are beauty vitamins that can make you pretty AND get you into Coachella! Problem(s) solved!"
"'My Adam's apple is canceled' 😂😂😂 I'm ded"
"I never thought I'd watch a 30-minute video with that background. But for ContraPoints? In a heartbeat.   Wordsworth would be proud."
"Having rational ideologies about ffs and subjective emotions of your own appearance does not always match. Even if someone goes for the natural look, who wants to be ugly unless deeply depressed."
"You are like a whole new person now. Certain features reminds me of Lauren Southern. I mean I don't like her cause she is full of shit but she is good looking."
"I know I'm goblin swine haha, but your beautiful now and have always been beautiful."
"If saying 'Choke me mommy' gives you pleasure then I'm your biggest sub"
"This channel's production quality is exponentially reaching movie standards. You have side characters with their own recognizable/rememberable  backgrounds, personalities  and style, all coming from a LGBT education channel. I'm beyond impressed."
"16:04 ‘I wanna attract non-binary people, too, of course’ Well aS a nOn-bInAry pErsOn: mission accomplished."
"I wouldn't get off you until the neighbours complained about the smell. Not that you asked for my opinion 🖤"
"Why would it be internalised transphobia if you want FFS?"
"Youtube recommended me your incels video for months and I always thought 'I dont need to be reminded these awful people exist by a gorgeous cis sexy woman that will make me feel ugly compared to her'. Then I got recommended a really old video, and I loved it, and I realised it was the same person. I dont know what is my point here, I guess that Im a fan and I shouldnt let my lack of confidence get in the way of my gayness."
"I feel so bad that I didn't even notice you had ffs because I don't have facial recognition, and therefore don't really notice changes in people's faces because I recognize them based on clothing/hair/a e s t h e t i c/how often they drag capitalism/ect."
"As a gay man who is attracted to most anything traditionally masculine...... Your appearance does nothing to arouse my interest romantically...... So there's that"
"The asmr dress!!!!! Make a video 2 hours long!"
"I thought you looked good before, but now you're actually stunning."
"WHY WOMEN WEAR MAKEUP: to try and make themselves more attractive, obviously, wearing it when men are around doesn't matter(it's not like they'll live their entire lives alone inside a bunker, there will allways be men around), they want to completely forget and live in denial of their actual looks because not being a 10/10(in their heads; yes, because of narcissism and a natural childish talent for completely blocking out reality, almost every woman thinks she's an irresistible goddess of beauty it's fucking surreal) bothers them so.  CONCLUSION: Women(in terms of obsession with looks) are like incels times million with a fuckton of rampant denial and narcissism(qualities not found in incels seeing as they acknowledge the fact they look like shit)."
"Another great video! You are amazing!"
"I thought you passed before, and at the beginning of the video I couldn't even tell you had gotten surgery, I just thought you had done your make up in a more feminine wayy.  I think it is a combination of the changes being so subtle and working well, and the fact that I've thought you a woman from the beginning. The first video I saw of yours I watched 20 minutes before you mentioned you were trans, and I wasn't sure if you were making a joke I was missing or not. Point being, you look great, I am glad the surgery changed the things you wanted changed in such a clean way. Loved this video, brings up a lot of good points about self image too. Keep it up"
"Yaaaas you’re back"
"You look good, Natalie.  That's all I have for you.  You look good.     I'm not sure how valid that comment is, but it's all I can come up with."
"So glad you released another video. Thank you."
"I only listen to asmr to help me sleep because of you drumming your nails on a skull. All your fault.    Thanks for the content."
"Jesus Christ, you're brilliant.  I regularly laugh out loud at some of your Precision strikes."
"Your new face confuses me.  I mean, you're beautiful, but you can't cut away everything from the gender you were born into.  You're definitely a lady.  And you have wit.  Total package!"
"my goodness Natallie, what an awesome surgery, I'm actually so blown away and I hope you are recovering well in your 'new skin'.  you looked fab before but now you've certainly come into your own!! you really look great, here's to one step closer to being the you, that you've always been."
"As a disgusting white, straight, cis-male, I can confidently say... sis snapped"
"Dear contra, I am an ardent viewer of your videos so please don't take this negatively:  Desires are the most strongly constructed and reinforced of all social structures.   We cannot demand of people that they either live up to standards or give up on their desires. We cannot demand sacrifice.   And this is where the dilemma lies: what is the apt moment of this sacrifice because at *some* point, it'll have to be made for change to effectively take place?  And the answer is usually: when the revolution comes (like you said: America needs a contra, not a Gigi) Revolutions, wars, stories of struggles and so on have turned out to be these purification ceremonies whereby we think that something radically different will rise out of such a sacrifice. And this is not to say that revolutions, wars or struggles do not change people or their desires. They do. And, historically, they have. The problem is that in the 21st century we defer our responsibilities by repeatedly citing or believing within ourselves that such a change is far away in the future. It has been cancelled as a real possibility, and thus conformity and compliance with the current social structures is the only we keep bearings of who we are and where we belong. People are not confident of their own sovereignty and their radical autonomy because in the neoliberal craze of building the rational consumer/individual, what we instead have in front of us, is a broken and shattered individual who must purchase and acquire more and more products to fill the cracks and crevices (literally and/or metaphorically) in their person. For people who embody particular physical features that may take the form of white nationalism. For others it takes other forms (like gender conformity, gender change by embracing 'femininity' or 'masculinity', sub-nationalist movements and so on). We are all trying to fix the same problem in the same fucking way.  We have to destroy these categories, and I am sure you'd agree, but the irony of it all is that one can at best merely *express* anguish at this moment. We simply do not know what to *do*!"
"on women it's a Madam's Apple"
"Glad your ffs went well! You look great you stylish aesthetic queen."
"Wonderful video! I think I will be visiting it for a little while. :)"
"I miss when you actually talked about interesting stuff in the world..."
"I'd be lying if I didn't admit that I whimpered in discomfort at the description of your surgery."
"IT WAS ALWAYS EVE'S APPLE"
"YESS SOPHIE IS GOD"
"tatiana petrova westbrookova LMAO"
"Glad to see you back. I wondered why you hadn't published any videos lately. You look great!"
"sis you’re so funny pleaaase let me breathe 😭"
"AS a TrAnS mAn working in academia I honestly can relate. I don't know if it is one of the many remnants of people believing me to be a girl growing up, but I am obsessed with beauty as well. My colleagues of any gender rarely give a fuck about styling or make up while I arrive in full on 'boy george as your sleep paralysis' realness. It strengthens my gender dysphoria but also contradicts it in strange ways as I have an overly specific male ideal in my head and I life in unreasonable fear of not meeting those standards. If you're a leftist academic or intellectual, you are basically expected to shed the contraints of societal pressure and stop striving for beauty. And if you are a trans man people tend to view any of your attempts at self-expression with an unforgivingly critical eye. So I end up in a hate spiral where I beat myself up for wanting to be beautiful as much as I am beating myself up over not being that.   What I am trying to say is, that I feel incredibly seen by this video. Let's forgive ourselves and convert beauty into style. Thank you.  Ps. steponmemotheryouaresobeautiful"
"My journey  MY JOURNEY  M Y J O U R N E Y mY jOuRnEy  MYYYYYYY JOURNEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY  my journey"
"Who needs the haters!!! You are beautiful!!!"
"I love you but you keep circle-strafing a reasonably pretty  elephant in the room."
"Great fine ok . Now get to work please."
"Lesbo checking in - yeah we straight chillin.  On the real tho - welcome to the eternal feminine struggle: no woman is ever happy about the way they look no matter how much we try, AND it's okay to crave conventional standards of beauty in order to be accepted in society because everyone else craves the same thing.  Remember in that Paulo Coelho book, where he tells that quick story about that nymph talking to the pond that missed Narcissus? And the pond was all like... 'dude i miss that guy because deep in his eyes I was able to see myself'? We. Are. All. That. Pond."
"C U N T Y"
"I cackled at “as a transgender woman”"
"Hello my dear ladies if you’re dealing with insecurities about your appearance here are a few fabulous tips 💁🏻‍♀️💅🏻 1. The highest heels/platform boots you can find 👠(if your shoes couldn’t shatter a skull by stepping on it, throw it in the trash)☠️👢 2. Some sharp jewelry that looks super cute but could cut someone’s throat if you want it to.💍 3. And lastly to bring the whole outfit together A HAND GUN IN YOUR CUTE BLACK PURSE 🔫🙎🏻‍♀️ (for all my pro gun control sisters, a taser or a really sharp knife will work just as fab🔪 )  Because who needs to feel beautiful when you can feel powerful.  Go slay your enemies QUEENS👸🏻"
"OMG SOPHIE"
"SOPHIE on ContraPoints? QUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN"
"Nice face"
"Wasn't there a study that resulted in the perseption of actual beauty being a thing that was found in babies and that they prefer the appearance of some over others, not something that is impacted by experience.  Can't remember the exact paper or if it was even rebutted."
"Contra, Lindsay, and PTube need to coordinate to space out their vids. It's gonna be another month of drought and I'm not sure I can handle it again. Great vids yall tho!"
"I cant stop staring at all those sequins. That top is gorgeous but don’t lie, it’s got to be so scratchy to wear!"
"So happy that you’re back. Seeing you upload is always the highlight of my month. I hope you’re doing okay, and I’m really glad that your surgery went well. You look so much happier."
"I know it's only been a month, but I feel like I've been waiting for forever for new ContraPoints in my life. Totally worth the wait, as always! <3"
"You deadass look friggin' phenomenal.  - Signed, a 34 year-old transbian who desperately wants FFS*  *(and some body work too but face first)"
"HOLY SHIT SOPHIE AND CONTRA"
"I'd like to come in here and 'well, actually' for straight men and mansplain makeup.  What? Why are you all running away?  OH COME ON ALL YOU DAMN SJWS!!!!! *shakes fists at clouds*      But seriously this video is amazing. I mean *all* your videos are amazing, but this one is especially so because you uploaded on my birthday. So it's like a birthday gift! A video from Contrapoints! Thank you!"
"Nice face. You got it. Don’t give it another thought."
"Natalie will be spared after the impending race war, I just can't bring myself to get rid of such a talent regardless of degeneracy."
"I always laugh when a guy says women wear makeup for men. Strangely none of those guys like me with my jade lipstick I like. Funny that..."
"You contemplate the futility of the struggle against the ravages of time, I stare at my face and contemplate the futility of my struggle against my facial hair."
"'As a middle class white boy with no athletic talent, I was treated like a genius by teachers and parents.' Oof, I feel that."
"Non pornographic use of the term 'bussy' is wild to hear. Ya said it so nonchalantly to it was funny as fuck."
"You were mentioning your transgender idols for personal beauty, I don't know how to feel now about mine being the early contrapoints aesthetic. :/"
"The age old question. Should we be worried about our pores, or the poors?"
"Really good use of Faceshopping"
"i LOVE you"
"When the video starts out with sophie, you know its going to be good"
"the de-chadenizing"
"- Claim that the reason incels don't get laid is not childhood trauma or ugliness, but rather toxic attitudes toward women and the wrong political opinions.  - 'looks don't matter, idiot' - Gets facial plastic surgery to become more attractive while dumping on pounds and pounds of makeup."
"Most of the time I just thank the gods that I don't have to look at myself all day..."
"These videos are just a big FUCK YOU to every filmmaker out there who thinks they're good until they see this fucking *masterpiece*"
"I'm always jealous of women who know how to wear make up.You're cute with or w/o."
"thank you mommy"
"gay or gamer ok bye"
"I honestly didn't notice the change, even after she pointed it out. I have a hard time with faces. As long as I can recognize enough of the face to put a name to the face, the rest of it's ignored. At the same time I wish I look like Natalie did pre-transition, it's the goal for my fat nb ass."
"such a great video. beauty standards for women/femininity are so fucking terrible and destructive. if someone as beautiful as contra (literally a 10/10 this isnt flattery holy fuck so cute) can feel insecure it makes me feel better about my insecurities."
"Knew I was in for treat when SOPHIE started playing."
"You are beautiful, sis. And I don't say that lightly real talk."
"Natalie you're sooo gorgeous! I totally understand the never feeling beautiful thing tho. I'm a woman who has been overweight for most of my life. Even when I had lost a ton of weight I wasn't happy, because believing you're beautiful is, at least to me, a mental thing - not a physical thing. It's only since I've become religious that I've been able to truly appreciate myself. I now love the body God gave me and am able to see the beauty in myself more and more these days. Not everyday, but certainly more than before. I hope you are able to see and appreciate your natural beauty someday. ❤"
"not even a second in and im immediately hit w Sophie,,, this is gonna be fantastic"
"can we all just appreciate the editing on this? the media studies student in me is hooked"
"I think Densel Washington's guide to beauty in the post-apocalyptic movie 'The Book of Eli' is where it is at (spoliers: his character is blind) the craters created by the nuclear war look supine, and truly all you need is wet wipes as the new global currency to feel beautiful - which I assume is what the metaphorical transition from Densel's character to Mila Kunis's'sss's character at the end is supposed to represent. Preserving knowledge. Avoiding getting shot - dying of sepsis. Not being Gary Oldman on film or in life."
"please let me step on your throat"
"Style > Beauty  Otherwise I'm fucked."
"Natalie    I want you to step on me     Plz DM thnx"
"the moment I heard them sophie sounds 1 second in i was like oh girl YOU DID NOT !!! 😍"
"Wait does every trans girl just tell themselves that they'd fuck themselves in the mirror. That's the only way to laugh instead of feel bad after stareing at myself for too long."
"you look great, hon"
"Isn't it safer to just secretly fall in love with them while quietly dying inside?' biggest wlw mood"
"Thanks for pronouncing van Gogh correctly! If I hear one more person call him 'van gow' I'll drop dead of an aneurysm."
"Woooooow this hit so many secret 'want to be beautiful/don't want to WANT to be beautiful' feelings. Thank you for your candor and your thoughtful break-down of everything, you're so good at making me think more deeply."
"4:58 If you don't pass then Blaire White is the only person on the planet that does lol"
"This video made me realise that as a man I haven't taken as much pride in my appearance in recent years, which I think has contributed to me feeling down/unenergetic sometimes.  Thanks for the wake-up call!"
"I now spiritually identify with 'A feral cat wandering the aisles of the liquor store'. I feel this on an ascended level."
"beauty is terror."
"While I can't speak for others, I think your attractivness is in large part due to your aesthetic. The clothes, the makeup and the mannerisms are all part of what I find attractive (along with your incredible analysis). As for passing or not that has a lot to do with people's idealization of 'woman' seeing how you always looked more femenine than I ever did even with makeup on (and I'm a cis woman). But also many women I know tend to be called masculine because of their face structure despite being born female. It didn't actually occur to me that you were trans until I watched some of your older videos. Lastly tje desire to look pretty has everything to do with feeling comfortable and strong, whenever I wear my leather jacket or a scarf I feel stronger and that reflects on my posture. If being femenine (as per society's standarts) makes you feel better then that's great. So many people don't even know what makes them feel good and that takes power away from them."
"Looks beautiful, I’m so happy for you 💗"
"The funny thing about my own situation is that I feel that I look TOO masculine. I have this impression that I look scary and old due to my square jaw and prematurely bald head. Of course, I am certainly not the only one here with feelings of self-loathing and despair over the incoming Ragnarok that we are powerless to stop."
"This is a journey ."
"Plastic surgery wont make me happy? Fuck"
"I believe that the only way to feel beautiful is to embrace some of your flaws, instead of erasing them. I don't mean to generalize, because I really can't comprehend or empathize with trans people's struggles with their body, but there's gotta be a balance between accepting yourself and actually improving your physical appearance. If you try hard enough you can see flaws everywhere.  Anyway I think that you're an exceptional, brilliant woman natalie, and you deserve all the good that comes your way. Each of your videos is a jewel"
"*This production value is something else*"
"I guess I don't understand the logic of 'feminine features' because there are mainstream 'attractive' men with 'feminine' features, and mainstream 'attractive' women with 'male' features...."
"Anyone know the name of the painting in the end credits?"
"If beauty wasn't on everyone's mind, we wouldn't have a Beauty Industry worth billions. Human condition."
"That procedure sounds like what drug cartels do to informants.  You’ll make it to Xibalba before I will.  Great vid!"
"nobody:   Natalie: *_mY JoUrNeY_*"
"You look so good! I had a hard time recognizing you at first. If i saw you and didn't know who you were, i would not know you transitioned."
"If I think that cutting my face is easier than living with an everyday struggle and self disappointment, isn’t that about the line for my own damn business? I want to be beautiful, because I want to look how I feel. And it’s nice when the external reality matches the personal reality."
"Watching this full screen on a 29' monitor was like a colour overload, Natalie's sequin top is so gorgeous."
"26:20 in times where classism isn't very pertinent, I still appreciate the odd tabby cameo, however brief."
"I'm so glad you used Faceshopping for this :) as someone considering ffs myself who's almost the same age, I relate to far too much of this video. big oof."
"first, congrats i'm happy you've healed from surgery !! 'maybe lesbians are just straight chillin'' dfasdfgsdfgsdg I AM !!"
"Thank you for this! It really summed up the things I have trouble putting into word, especially the over-whelming guilt. I'm going to be an actress but the guilt of knowing that I'll be contributing and probably conforming to(the man) beauty standards that hurt me so much when I was younger and still do. There's so much of, 'well if only you were taller, thinner, whiter, etc' you'd be perfect for the role! The director never imagines someone like me in the lead and the problem that I keep bringing up, is that other people do. Wild.   P.S: ten out of ten would subscribe to a gigi gorgeous impersonator channel if you do ever decide to change."
"She has no style! She has no grace! Th-th-this kong is a fucking disgrace!"
"Oh how I’ve missed you!!!! This is fucking amazing. I’m so glad you’re not leaving us to become a Gigi Gorgeous impersonator ❤️ I think I’d perish of a broken heart/soul/everything"
"the first second had me pulled."
"top 10 youtuber face reveals"
"Ah Contra you look as radiant as ever, as a beautiful godess of changelings!"
"YESSSSSSS FINALLY!  Where you been girl? We been STARVING!  *watches video  Oh. You were taking the time necesaary to produce quality content. That's cool, that's cool..."
"This is an amazing ASMR channel."
"Girl! That dress... I'm so in love"
"i am thinking of fixing my face 🌸 If i could do it this moment I would. Is there really a choice anymore?"
"9:55 no truer words have ever been spoken"
"You look like the tall, runner girl I had a crush on freshman year"
"I agree that the analogy of Asian people getting double eyelid surgery is weak. What's 'Eurocentric' is assuming Asian beauty standards are correlated exclusively with wanting to look European.  I'm sorry people threw such silly comments at you when you decided to talk about wanting FFS. You look fantastic!"
"At one point in the video you start 'pretending' to be self-aware about how you're privileged enough to get surgery, and at that point in your script or recording you should have had an epiphany and maybe rethought your approach to this. You are privileged. And because of your wit, intellect and ability to entertain you're going to become even more privileged, meaning this shit is making you rich. So maybe start reflecting on that and how you're aren't some trailer park dumpster trash anymore. This isn't a 'feel good' message either, you really ought to have second-guessed that pretend self-awareness segment. What I'm saying is stop pretending you're 'one of the masses with problems just like you people.' You aren't."
"CUNTraPoints, we stan"
"This might be my new favorite Contra video. You look phenomenal, Natalie. So happy for you!"
"AAAHHHH FACESHOP. I love this video."
"MAYBE IT'S MAYBELLINE!"
"That skincare routine was the most accurate thing I have ever seen"
"Natalie with the FFS looks unnervingly similar to Jenna Marbles"
"Here in NYC there is an old saying among transwomen, 'If you were a jerk before SRS, afterward you will be a jerk who has had SRS. Why is that better?'"
"Regardless of your concerns about beauty, Natalie - and for the record (as a gay man) I think you're a nice looking lady - rest assured you have style by the bucketload! And, as you rightly point out, this is far more important - just keep being your charming, interesting, knowledgeable, thoughtful self and you'll always be OK!"
"every time the queen says disabled 10 years are added to my lifespan. thank you momther!"
"Regina George’s mom serves mocktails     our mom serves TEA"
"Screen for your wh... Ashy skin, which goes with wh... Whispy hair.. XDDDddd.... No but ur neck is leathery and your cheeks are horrible... Hope you get your confidence back."
"'I have to guess what I look like' 'It's hard being a 6' idk, seems like you got it down"
"I love you so much you didn’t owe us this but it was fucking cool anyway."
"Serving Lisa Kudrow looks??"
"Nice use of SOPHIE, also your 'sition stepped on the gas hard since i last heard of you. Seriously though, that use of faceshopping was perfection with the editing"
"MOM"
"I've been waiting for this day"
"thank you for another beautiful video about ugly truths"
"Oh shit I think I might've said that. >_< I hope I didn't say that..."
"All we’re doing on this channel is observing the bimboification of Natalie Wynn"
"You're incredibly stylish gurl"
"Contrapoints is my favorite ASMRtist"
"This is so millennial. Acknowledge the world as full of terrible problems but justify intense narcissism anyway."
"That dress, that commentary, THAT NEW NOSE 🖤!"
"have to ask .. what eye shadows did you use for the main blue/purple look"
"Gurl you had me at bussy lmao. Love you!"
"You look so beautiful sis 💕"
"I think a lot of the pressure people and entertainers in public spaces like yourself feel about appearances are internal. I think because you're so afraid that people will not accept you that you project your own insecurities on society and those around you. I personally always felt like I was being made fun of because of some of my differences but then I realized it wasn't societal standards or people around me, it was me. It's hard to cope with this so I felt that a lot of people in subconscious denial will have this 'me against the world' mantra; society's out for me and anyone like me! Yes you're definitely not normal but there is certainly nothing wrong with this but there's also nothing with society, other people just don't act like you. Nobody isn't the wrong some people are more stereotypical than others. I hope this helps you find peace."
"This video has scalpedt me. SCALPEDT. The quality is next level !!!!"
"let's all take bets on how long it takes her to start to consider ffs a necessity to be valid. I give it a month."
"that is some god tier biological asmr"
"I mean sometimes I have to rewatch the same parts of Contra's videos like 10 times bc I was too distracted by her prettiness to listen to the actual points"
"Look at the bright side: we will all day eventually. Hopefully soon."
"You invented beauty perfect angel choke me mommy"
"'I guess I'd just rather think about the aesthetic instead of the apocalypse.' Relatable."
"Real transexuality, as in female brain in male body, is a real thing; when the fetus grows it begins growing female then if the chromosomes are male it begins the process of growing into a male, this process can fail half-way and only act on the body leaving the brain to keep growing female without any changes (this is why we don't see 'as many' aka any male brain in female body transexuals). Gender dysphoria is just mental illness, there are way more crazy people than there are real transexuals, this should be treated not encouraged."
"The difference between men and women is often a fine line. So I guess trimming a few millimeters here and there is a big deal if you feel the need.  I was born with a body that falls into the intersex body type. In fact I had a ovotestis and even developed stage three testicular/ovarian cancer to go along with it. Surgeries carved out much of my under developed male organs and yet I really wish they had gone all the way and made me the women I know I am. I’m not trying to become anyone other than myself.  You are doing the same I guess. Becoming yourself."
"#NotAllDaddyDoms is the new social movement I'm following."
"I'm just a cisbi man, but even I'm concerned about my own looks. Mostly because I've lived most of my life in a peripheral town of Hungary, and I'm slowly turning 30. I originally intended to either move to Budapest or London, but rents costs a lot at good ol' BP, Brexit is a mess, and my father thought I'll save up for a cheap house with no gas or water. I'm a bit overweight, but I'm thinking on losing weight, however first I have to move to the house that my mother bought (and has both gas and water) so I can cut paprikáskrumpli (carbs mixed carbs: technically it's junk food without the benefits of junkfood) out of my diet, also I have to find the exact thing that supposed to cancel out most of the side effects of my antiepileptic medication - Depakene/Convulex (if I remember, it's in Brain Force, but I won't buy that overpriced piece of shit)."
"Don't get me wrong. I love these videos and this one is quite thought-provoking and interesting, but I get a little nauseous from all the praises in the comment section from people who admit to not having watched the video yet. I find it a bit unsettling and creepy, to be honest. Let's not forget Nat's just a person. 😉"
"Wordsworth whipped out--superb."
"This was really inspiring"
"it opened with sophie's music but i thought i had accidentally opened spotify"
"I have a bald spot. It annoys me. I debate getting something to alleviate this. This video helped. Now I think I'm a little better off."
"That intro scared me"
"since you briefly mentioned lesbians i’ll give my own lesbian hot take: we are in the unique position of the deep deep part of us raised by a heteronormative society that wants to be attractive to men and preform the male fantasy however at the same time having the desire to burst into flames everytime a man looks at you and only want to be seen and known by other non-binary people and women so it forms a odd thing of a balancing act of trying to figure those two desires out (but it does help knowing that things that society usually shames women for like body hair, stretch marks, etc are things you happen to find attractive)"
"so i came to this video thinking 'its been a while since i watched a post transition CP video, ive seen a lot of pre transition natalie lately in my binge. lets remember how well she passes!' then im greeted with this gorgeous professionally sculpted face"
"you will never be a woman."
"You always leave me with so much to contemplate."
"Did Zoe sample FF7? Holy crap how awesome. And did I maybe hear some Evangelion too?"
"Hope you had a restful recovery!  I also own that Mario Badescu facial spray,  I find that it's good for setting make-up. Great video, as always"
"I want to have my name chiseled on my skull and several large bones in case I'm brutally murdered and my body isn't found for a few decades. In case of decapitation, I'm ensuring identification with various bones being engraved.  Anyone else think about that? No? Just me?"
"Contrapoints gives me inspirational motivation with smiling."
"Beauty means fitting in instead of hanging around on the outside. It's hard not to want it. (And no one's lying when they compliment you. But I think a lot of people feel that way about themselves, I always have.)"
"Thank you Natalie <3 you're such a great example for people all over the world <3 luv U"
"Who needs poppers when you have Faceshopping starting out your video <3"
"you look good natalie, I used to pass, now i go out of my way not to, and have nothing to explain, stealth is not fun!"
"Random thought: once we've gone fully post-carbon and defeated climate change... what new name will we use for 'plastic surgery?'"
"Honestly, speaking as a really fat tans woman, the lesbians aren't really that judgemental and most my relationships have been great with like a couple of terfs thrown in. data point of 1 I know."
"There is an old self-help book, 'Psycho-Cybernetics' by Maxwell Maltz. One of the things he observes is that people have different reactions to scaring and surgery. There was a time when young Prussian men liked getting a 'dueling scar' to boast of their masculine bravery! Most (sane) people would be devastated to get such a horrible scar on their cheek! He was a plastic surgeon before he was a self-help guru. He claimed that no matter how much surgery some people get, they still think they are ugly, or have a big nose (or whatever.) Maltz decided the people had psychological flaws and refused to accept their new reality. That's why he developed Psycho-Cybernetics! He also claims it takes about 30 days to adjust to a new change. So you may still be adjusting to your changes. These days there are Kindle and audio versions of the book! (If you're interested.) I still have my copy from the 1960's. I am pretty sure the original book dates to the 1950's or even 1940's. But, Honey, IT'S TIMELESS! https://www.amazon.com/Psycho-Cybernetics-Deluxe-Original-Classic-Guide/dp/0143111884?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duckduckgo-d-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0143111884"
"'America needs a ContraPoints more than it needs a Gigi Gorgeous right now.' It's much more fun to fight Nazis in Wolfenstein than in DC. I know that's what I'd rather be doing some days.   For what it's worth, you've been a source of strength for me while I've been out registering voters, making calls, and protesting. And have helped me through my own inner darkness, particularly 'Incels' and the video on said Darkness. I may even start making content myself under your influence my dear Ms. Wynn....You evil creature, you're corrupting me into the evil of YouTubing. Ah well, if I had to be damned to attention seeking on the internet, I am glad it was by only the most regal of queers.   On a less appropriate note, since I know my dear muse loves 90s video games, THIRST OVERWHELMING!"
"Omg what a queen, I think Natalie is always beautiful sjskajskahdkahskahskahs"
"Yes please Sophie yes"
"Welcome back 👋🏾 I needed this page back in my life!"
"Natalie please don't bring back bussy as a term my timeline can't take it"
"I stopped writing my paper due tomorrow to watch this video and did not regret it!"
"I've missed you so much. You and Lindsay Ellis make my YouTube feed"
"ContrASMR"
"I think the key point of this video (that critique of beauty standards doesn’t lead to an answer to the desire for beauty) stems from a poor critique of beauty standards. The problem with modern beauty standards is that there are BETTER things to notice in people, not that it is wrong to appreciate good looks. Yes, Megan Markle is beautiful, but that doesn’t matter if you meet her and don’t like her personality: if you were to find her self-involved or boring. Character matters much more than looks, and if one bases their interactions on that, one will be happier. It isn’t that beauty standards stem from hate or fear (though they do), it is that they miss a much more important domain of human relationships which is much more gratifying. Vanity of personality only leads to good actions; vanity of the body only leads to self-hatred."
"I have Pikachu in my mind as well."
"I think you looked the best in the last video (Gender Critical)"
"It's about control. EVERYTHING IS ALWAYS ABOUT CONTROL"
"I'm laughing so hard, when you said 'lesbians are straight chilling' I thought to myself, 'she's right, I'm happy looking Ugly because I have this butch aesthetic I know I'm pulling off well, and while it's nowhere near conventionally beautiful I like it because it's curated, reflective of myself, and intentional' and that's literally the conclusion you came to. Lesbians, straight chilling since forever."
"Music had a real 'Smile Guide' feel to it today"
"You're gorgeous no matter what surgeries you get. I'm glad you were able to do what was best for you. You look amazing! (You also look like a 20year old!)  And as always, thank you for talking about this!"
"Gottem!"
"as a cis lesbian i can tell you i'm obsessed with being skinny and beautiful, we're all doomed"
"Q  U  E  E N"
"What's the song at 16:28 K swear I've heard it before."
"The toner comment killed me, because I sell skin care stuff and I feel seen."
"YOUR NOSE IS SO FUCKING CUTE OMFG"
"“Usually when I look in the mirror I can’t actually tell whether I’m pretty or not, like with other people I can just look at them and instantly make a judgement about it but with myself I have to just guess.” This is why I love you Natalie, you get it."
"that satie outro remix tho"
"OMG YOU OPENED WITH FACESHOPPING!!! CERTIFIED QUEEN"
"God, your humour was so on point it was unreal. I laughed endearingly many times. As a human being who also lives in society I too had thoughts on beauty during a good part of my life, this was a warming journey through the subject.  And damn shout out to Zoe for that gymnopedie reference at 25:27 (is that how you link?). One of the first times I recognized some notes like that, I'm proud. And you used it again at the end, just beautiful. This video was extremely well realized, thank you. Edit: and I stan the decision to use the mirror room as background. Looked goooorgeous. And your clothes. And your make up. And yas choke me mama step on the space between the fingers of my feet but not actually in them because I dislike any pain you looked amazing."
"The 'F' really fucking hit me lmfao"
"SHIPPUDEN FOPPINGTON IS MY NEW FAVORITE CHARACTER!11!!!1!!!1!eleven!!11!"
"So could it be that a man who wants to be a woman doesnt want to actually be a woman but the ideal of a woman?"
"20:10. I love this beauty routine bit. I also have issues with the neck aging thing. There are creams specific for that.   You sure love the mists and goddamn if I haven't read the missha time essence is a better deal than the SK II.   Share your routine with us beauty obsessed folks.   I know this may be seen as parasocial synchophant-ing but I really think you are very beautiful and I do see you as a woman like any of those beauty gurus that or cis or pass. Love your style too though I could never wear sequins dresses (too itchy)."
"Dear Natalie, among the things you talked about in this film you mentioned that you're 'stuck' with Contrapoints (and I'm not sure if it was meant in a mere humorous way). I've been watching you for years and I wonder if you truly wish to change the content or rather change direction of your films? Or more abandon the 'contrapoints identity'?  I know the internet kinda pushed you into this role and I would really love to hear more about your thoughts on this. I've seen one of the speeches you gave on a panel (?) you were invited to about this role that has been assigned to you and I would love to hear if anything has changed for you since then. As much as I love your content I wish for you to create what you want to and not only what 'people expect you to'💙"
"FFS. Oh, for fuck's sake, are you telling me I can't use that anymore? FFS!"
"Wait wait wait, 'Choke me, Mommy' is kosher? Contra, why didn't you tell me sooner?"
"Mom is back!"
"Contrapoints: the heiress apparent to David Lynch"
"You may not think so yourself but you truly are beautiful, in every sense.  It takes willpower to look away from what hurts to what makes you happy, but don’t give up on loving yourself it takes time!"
"I don't wear makeup and I don't shave... much. I also have no philosophical or ideological problems with those that do. It's like, people should be able to like, do what they wanna do. Like like, personal liberty or whatever. Sometimes I think those Ayn Rand books I read in high school messed up my brain too much, but then I just think of dancing Pikachu."
"I have never believed anyone when they've said I'm pretty."
"I lost it at skinmaxxing 🤣"
"Holy shit this video speaks to me as a ~*32 year old lady*~. Also I went through my entire Masters and PhD in a science in a full face of glam makeup. The thing about science is we're weirdos so that was just my weird thing."
"Face-off"
"thanks for the content!!! always interesting"
"Fwiw, I thought you looked more feminine than usual the second the video started. Also, this upload was absolutely mesmerizing."
"'Phones live in a society' - dead"
"Blaire ain’t got shit"
"Thanks Natalie!"
"I miss ur old nose n chin tbh"
"So women wear make up to boost their non-existent self esteem? Makes sense."
"'Gay or Gamer' Fuck me Contrapoints is so good"
"There are other reasons that we don't wear makeup other than us wanting to look masculine and not wanting to be like the other girls. Don't you think we've got something better to do with our time than put on make up? geesh."
"The skin care routine bit was too real as a 28 year old who recently discovered fine lines around my eyes and has been launched into a rigorous, sisyphean cycle of skincare product application as well. Wonderful video as always!"
"I care about feeling attractive and the confidence it brings. If I didn't think I looked good in a dress, I'd never be brave enough to leave the house in one."
"Gotta upload while I'm browsing porn subs, smh. Rude."
"God this is one of your best videos I love you so much"
"Compelling, sincerely compelling."
"24:04"
"I'm supposed to be doing my homework, but Contra Just uploaded so fuck that shit."
"You brightened my day with this upload. All of your videos are both thoughtful, funny, educational, artistic, and just in general very *a e s t h e t i c*"
"Why be beautiful when you can just use a snapchat filter?"
"You stare at your face for 10 minutes, your eyes go directly to your flaws and then you start to think about aging and both the psychological and sociological aspect of it. To think there are people out there who think you not a real woman makes me laugh. BTW use the sunblock cream"
"Hi! look for the books of Maitena Burundarena, an argentine cartoonist."
"i genuinely love you"
"Me: Sends a friend a ContraPoints video Me: Starts watching an older ContraPoints video Me: Decides to leave it and go to sleep 'Forgive me mommy, i'm gonna return tomorrow' Youtube: Notification appears Me: Takes a look who it is 'No mommy! Why? I need to sleep. Ah shit, fuck it!' Me: Clicks Natalie: Surprise motherfucker!"
"Disappointed. No mention of shitgibbons."
"I thought I was a straight guy but Contra said she called every single one...   and I didn't get a call...   so...."
"Erik Satie would shit himself if he knew how often his music is still used everywhere, all the time. He'd also probably be pissed that it's always that same one. Glad you're back, you look great btw."
"Biology is the nature of the sequin."
"I'm a lesbian and I can confirm that we are in fact straight chillin every single one of us"
"ohhhhhhhhhhhh cmon fishhhhh"
"Honest opinion: I feel in love with how you looked before so the new improvements are startling to me, but in the end of the day its still your face as you say. You are still the hottest woman on youtube."
"I hope you're really happy! You look fucking AMAZING!"
"something here makes me slightly unnerved. maybe its because she looks very similar but not quite the same? idk, shes still gorgeous."
"Hell yeah"
"the production value on this channel is insane"
"Really loved the video :) It's weird to see the changes in your face so well even if it is but a few millimeters of bone. Nice."
"Thank you! This might be my favorite of your videos."
"Your skin is beautiful. May I borrow it? Promise to return it when done! ❤️😘"
"Just wanted to say thanks. I'm CIS, but when you talk about disliking what you see in the mirror, about finding yourself attractive once a month, I feel seen and I feel valid. You also leave me feeling smarter than I did before I started a video. So, you know, Thank you."
"For the T-girls who want surgerys but don’t have enough money watch my video “Becoming a Vietnamese Ladyboy Escort”"
"God-like song choices"
"One thing I do for the whole “to change a construct, change society” idea is to change the way I view the construct first, and then act on change. Usually changing the way I perceive a construct to something neutral feeling is a good way to start to think about where the boundary is social change is.  For example, interpreting makeup as face paint can very quickly change the way you think about it. And I’m not meaning vaguely acknowledging that makeup is technically face paint on an intellectual level, I mean changing the way you automatically think about makeup on a near visceral level. And this isn’t to make fun of makeup, it’s just to see it differently. There’s nothing morally wrong with wanting to paint your face, but a society that has created a sustained desire in some people to regularly paint their face starts to get questionable."
"Hmm nobody is honest? Personally I think you are pretty, but not pretty enough for instagram. But who is anyway? Most people on instagram don't look like that in real life, just look at /r/instagramreality. I decided to install facetune today to see what the big deal is and it's pretty crazy. It's cliche but do not think appearance matters that much, I think that personality changes how people see us. I'd think you would attract most people, maybe not in the first few seconds but after 20 minutes of talking you can basically step on them mama. I remember not being attracted to my bf at first, but now I think he's the best looking person I know. Same goes for my math teacher lmao"
"So real, tho. Also, you're beautiful and thank you for this video!"
"A truly wonderful Fear and Loathing reference."
"that sequin top reminds me of my grandma... i had a weird grandma"
"Fun fact: Dairy Queen is my hangover food, so I don't get to judge anyone for their chosen level of beauty standards. Being shameless trash has its perks."
"F to all the men dying tomorrow"
"You look great and I'm glad you feel more comfortable with yourself now"
"'Maybe lesbians are straight chillin'...while everyone else has completely lost their minds.' aS A lEsBIaN um.....you're not wrong."
"Whatʻs the name of the documentary cited around 15:30?"
"Thank god you exist"
"5’2” happy baby bouncy bio girl"
"Oh my God great video thank you so much for making this! I have wondered in the past if there was a line for transgendered folk between body dysmorphia and just the general dissatisfaction with their bodies that the rest of us cisgendered people feel.  Like I'm fat and I think that losing weight will make me happy with my body but I have a feeling I'll find something else to be unhappy with if / when I lose weight."
"I love Contra more than I love myself and I'm kinda fine with that"
"you look so pretty"
"Whatʻs the name of the documentary cited around 15:40?"
"Faceshopping is truly a banger and I am so happy to see it in the wild. Thank you for blessing us with more content you classy minx."
"20:10 ish you look just like Simone Giertz and I will now never unsee that similarity."
"knew it would be gold from the second face shopping came on"
"I am going to power through this, but anything relating to surgery makes me so anxious I'm nauseous."
"2 and half minutes in, I have to take a break. You look beautiful Natalie!"
"Contrapoints i love u"
"I am glad that your recovery from surgery is going well. Your video made me think about a few things. I don't know why, but I appreciate beauty, but I can't bring myself to care about my own. I empathize with those who feel very strongly about gender, but I don't feel like a gender nor do I care about my own gender. Sometimes I wish I did care because others expect me to care and I could relate to more people. I don't know if this makes any sense. Anyways this was a thought provoking and enjoyable video experience as always. ❤"
"A most  S T Y L I S H  queen"
"Hey if it helps I started watching your later videos and I didnt even know you're trans until I saw the older ones. So I think you definitely do pass and look good"
"Missed you!  Glad you're back.  Surgery looks really good.  Very natural."
"I just gotta say, Natalie’s eye makeup looks absolutely stunning"
"Now thats pass!"
"I just had a panic attack when you said you’re a 6. I thought I was a 6. Now I have to downgrade to at least a 3. Thanks ContraPoints 😐"
"you need to do legit asmr tbh"
"The 2 genders, Gay & Gaymers"
"I love this transparency. No shame in surgery. I am proud to say I’ve also paid a dr. to peel my nose off my face and shave mm of bone too! Lmao. I do love the “if you care about looks, you may not be bright” LOVE IT"

"Bitch you passed when you where a twink 😉"
"this made me go put on a face mask"
"I am always SO EXCITED when I see there is a new contrapoints video to watch!!!!! Great video"
"your videos are so goddamn good i usually can’t watch anything over 10 mins but here i am, watching a 30 min video, wishing it was longer"
"BIOLOGICAL SEQUINS... OOOH"
"Is it weird that I would have enjoyed it if she hadn't worn clothes at all"
"I definitely think you're beautiful but I tend to find people I like beautiful so my opinion is pretty subjective. However, objectively, your skin care regime is legitimately intimidating and I can not imagine doing it daily so ya know. Congrats on your willpower and dedication!  Also I want the sequin dress SO VERY BADLY AHHHHHHH"
"It is possible the sole reason women sleep with men is to feel beautiful."
"Its hard being a 6 lmao I love you"
"We finally got a post!"
"Please, make the subtitles available."
"I feel like if she started a cult I would be the one stirring the Kool-Aid."
"15:58 me the fuck too"
"For real, the bit where you have no makeup like at 20 mins legit looks like a girl with no makeup, the tiny changes make a huge difference. Kinda look a little like Simone Giertz haha"

"Yaas queen.  Stomp on my throat, mommy.  UwU"

"how do you always so precisely put into words the things I also feel but barely even know how to begin to explain in my own mind?"
"'You jackals, you vultures, you goblin swine' More please."
"first it was a little weird to see you have a different face (honestly I was really into your old nose) but when I saw you without make-up, I got a lot more comfortable :3 But you are wrong, you do have style, it's the reason why I love your videos :e"

"Something that is not asked often enough.  WHY is beauty, even so called feminine beauty ONLY for women, or gay men?  Perhaps this is the issue, or one of them.   Much of what is stated here signs a lot like social dysphoria.  I know I myself deal with that.  I LIKE looking 'feminine' but only to an extent.  I like blurring the lines.    Gender expectations, rules, limits are the problem.  Frankly and honestly though...you have ALWAYS....yes always had a pleasant look to you.  I wish society would just go eff itself, and drop all these damned gendered norms.  They do far more harm than good.    My BIG question is WHY?  Why is beauty...even that which is called 'feminine beauty' ONLY for women and gay men in the minds of so many people?  What the hell is this nonsense."

"Why can people be beautiful in their own chosen way WITHOUT having to be a certain subset of the population."
""
"Why is making one's eyes POP, through the use of eye makeup or, accentuating one's lips ONLY for women, or gay men?"
""
"Why is having really long hair only for that subset?  Again according to too many."
""
"Why is being proud of, and SHOWING under a skirt, or shorts long legs, ONLY for women...or gay men?"
""
"This video really exposes some serious BS in our cultures...and honestly I think it exposes things that contribute to much of the violence, hate, anger, ect in our world."
""
"Men are forced into these damned boxes, that women have for the most part been able to free themselves from, while retaining their 'femininity'.   So when the FUCK will men do the same."

My thoughts while shaving:  50% of the time, I'm just shaving - normal mental background hum. 25% of the time - 'Damn, you are one good looking man!' 25% of the time - 'How have you ever managed to see a naked woman without $ changing hands?!?'  Reckon I'm average looking."

"So, everyone has a Dorian Grey syndrome, except for the Lesbians? huh..."
"Have you watched 'A Fantastic Woman'? Consider it. I've not had the joy to watch any episode of 'Pose'. These two distractions of beauty, relationships and thoughtful or reactionary behavior really gave me insight about my own issues. When you talk about reality, and show you, I see that when I'm showing myself, I feel more secure. I'm hoping that makes sense.    Best wishes, and don't think that's pressure on you. I've followed, and am lucky this world I'm found in has this kind of media. Do what's best for you. Take care of yourself."
"How drastically has the prevalence of mirrors altered the self and society? Not for the better..."
"At the part where Natalie was like 'a lot female grad student don't wear makeup' I'm just thinking oh shes talking about me now.... great now I have to psychoanalysis my aversion to putting on mascara and wearing anything other than jeans and crewnecks. Is it because I'm in a 'male dominated field' (which like honestly its been pretty half and half in my experience with my fellow students) or am I just lazy? honestly im probably just lazy."
"Your Style is Immense."
"Thank you."
"Finished video. Thank you for sharing! I have always been obsessed with being “ beautiful” and lately have been asking dear me “ If you just ...you know...let your body be what it was and be kind to it...what would you be so afraid to lose?  Well...I might stop doing all these actions that will eventually lead to me being kind to my body! I can’t risk that! So i must continue to hate myself!”.  I hate myself so I can eventually like myself and if i allow myself to like myself I am afraid I will stop desiring actions that lead to me liking myself haha The whole cycle is madness. I think when we acknowledge we can do both: the reality of our preferences, creativity, expression, desires and knowing we don’t have to DROP those things can lead to us feeling safe enough to actually give our bodies a break.  Maybe the answer isn’t in pretending all of that doesn’t matter to us ? I love that you highlight this. we don’t have to sacrifice those desires before we can like the person in the mirror.  It can be both. To an expression  person, it kind of has to be both. Love love."
"I'm a 5'2 'bio-girl' and I still want a nose job. Nothing is ever enough, and the grass is always greener."
"WOW!  Natalie... I thought you were kinda hot before, but that Facial Feminization Surgery was really 'the cherry on top' wasn't it?  Hey, you're not into Little Old Sixty-Somethin Jewish Guys who can't lose that  last annoying 35 lbs, are you (oh, it's not so bad if I keep my cloths on)?"
"Oh being woman just means being  crazy about your looks cause since you are 5 years old ppl tell you 'how beautiful you are' and that's that like that's all you have to offer so no wonder so many of us care so much about how we look, it did help when i realized that i'm a dyke and that i find so many different women attractive no matter how much they fit or don't fit 'beauty standards'"

"Glad you're back."
"@9:40 this is real as a cis chick. I feel like throughout my life I've always had to lean really hard into the weird not-like-other girls flex in the hopes that people (men) will take me seriously. I also want to be beautiful. But I go the other route really hard and put up a scuffed front most of the time and just feel ugly and also like I'll never be respected? I don't know"
"I'm wondering what your reaction would be if we sent this video to yourself at a time before you were even considering the idea that you might be trans."
"Where’s the dress from?"
"You're so brave for putting all your insecurities out in the open. Thank you. Keep it up."
"'I guess I'd rather think about the Aesthetics than the Apocalypse. And that's the Darkness.' God damn, the Contrapoints Cinematic Universe is expanding."

"this video is almost perfect, but you didn't specify whether or not baker's yeast would work instead of japanese or korean yeast so because of that it's gonna have to be a no from me."
"IG is a cancerous festering .... hole of darkness. The face tune app is the least of it's sins. I am so happy, I grew up pre-social media, and I am so so worried for children, especially young girls. IG does horrible things to adults, who supposedly have more immunity to it, I can't imagine what it does to teens. I know this sounds like pearl clutching, and fatalistic, but I worry."
"Your intellectual and emotional sincerity never cease to amaze me. I cackled three times-audibly-watching this in a high-end London restaurant, so thank you for that. Once again, thank you for work of such high quality. Also, I must say-wow. You are so beautiful."
"I miss Contra's old face...."

"How come this video ended up been way darker than the one called 'The Darkness'?"
"Sequin ASMR though!!"
"Natalie said I know my audience listens to Sophie 😂"
"YES!! SOPHIE 🎶❤️"
"You have achieved pretty.Now give me that dress."
"after 16:21 I just had to pause the video due to a laughing fit I thought was going to kill me, I didn't expect it!"
"i wish you were real and not an internet goddess"
"Two things: One. This video is fucking with me mentaly since i have realy bad bdd, with a terrible body, and always had been the 'it's soo sad that you are fat, you are soo beautifull' Two. Mama contra while transitioning looked realy good but still clockable without makeup. Now she is soo feminine that i don't think she could ever not pass.  Now, when are they releasing foundation for men god damnit"
"gotta study for an HL math test but paused to watch this 😂😂"
"appreciated the bit with the episode titles"
"16:20 That is the most accurate shit, no joke I think about that video at least once every day"
"13:29 Ugh i found this to be a rather lesbophobic/ignorant comment. Have you not seen lesbian youtube? they are extremely obsessed as well. Your view of lesbians is very stereotyped and outdated!"
"I was having a bad day, but this makes it better  (Please step on me)"
"I may need the end of this video (before the credits) as a tattoo. Or maybe at least a tee shirt. You're amazing, CP! I'm not sure if this pan-queer is equivalent to mass society's view, but I think you're devastatingly gorgeous."
"One hears 'wearing make-up is a form of deceit' on the internet less often these days, and I can only assume it's because the visibility wild and extravagant colour and styles have made people realise that it was never intended for them...."

"Another great video 💜💜💜💜💜💜"
"Your surgeon did such an outstanding job omg. It all looks incredibly natural."
"big dyke without hair here, very into pretty and girly things, love some flowery pink decor, i seem v butch n chill but oh boy, give me those god damn sequins"
"JP said that women wear makeup to attract men because red lipstick is the colour of 'arousal', but what about the blue lipstick trend? That's literally the opposite of red, JP needs to stop acting like he knows anything about makeup."
"*why is no one talking about the skull feel*"
"Damn, girl. Cant believe you went through all that. Pain really is beauty."
"I’m only 10 minutes in but Natalie I am so so happy you made this video. I grew up as a really really undeniably ugly child who had a partially cosmetic partially orthodontic jaw surgery a couple years back that completely changed my looks, and everything you’re saying is so true. It really has changed my life and changed how people treat me, but I still find myself feeling guilty for being vain and caring about my appearance as much as I do. Thank you so much for making this video!"
"So happy for you on your journey. Anybody ever tell you you look like Toni Collette?"
"Who do you think is gonna win season 11? Really sad that Vanjie got eliminated"

"SOPPHHIEEE"
"As a cis femme lesbian I can say that we aren't all 'chillin'.   Also loved the biological sequence, Nat. ❤️"
"This hit harder than I thot it would. I am a fat 21 almost 22 year old woman with only one man ever calling me beautiful before. And I literally was sitting in my sister’s room 20 minutes before this was posted thinking how I wished I was pretty. I don’t want to wear make-up cuz I hate the way it makes me feel so I blame myself for not being skinny and not being pretty at all. I can’t afford surgeries or a gym membership but i struggle with still wishing that I could just be seen as pretty without having to go through all the social standards. But I loved this video and it nice to see someone being honest. We want to be pretty just to be pretty."
"Gawd, this video is my spirit animal this month. I know some of the downer stuff in my head is stress over being lonely and lacking a fulltime fullfilling job, basic stuff, but, heh. I bought this really fabulous wallet, second hand lux brand, for part of my tax return, and right now... Okay, right now, it's stylish enough that I feel like I have to be better for its sake. Straighten your back, the wallet demands it! Style your hair, pick out a neat outfit, the wallet carries you! My skin is so bad right now. So anyway, thank you for this video, it's a pretty nice feeling knowing we're all in the same boat at least. <3"

"My main takeaway from about every Contrapoints video: Shit's complicated."
"You know how we put a quote or two from the video in a comment to highlight the parts we thought were most funny or resonated most with us? [INSERT FULL TRANSCRIPT HERE] Also, in the interest of being a Good Fan, I can keep comments about your beauty to myself. It shouldn't be my place to have opinions or make comments - even positive ones are a physical judgment, and I am sorry the internet is constantly on you for how you look. I'm just happy when people who make me happy are happy.   Can we get a 30 minute long sequin scratching video?"
"I could go into a long comment but right now I’m just gonna say I relate. I’ve always kind of associated wanting to be beautiful with shallowness but it’s interesting/good to hear it doesn’t necessarily mean that. Can’t believe this didn’t occur to me before but I don’t really think about this much. I don’t really wear makeup because I find it tiring but I find everything tiring because I have depression so.. idk. I’ve kind of given up for the time being. I just need to focus on taking care of myself before trying to look good but it doesn’t stop the desire. Maybe this is why I rarely leave the house. This turned into longer comment than I thought. I feel if I tried it would be a pursuit in futility and I may become obsessed/preoccupied, idk. Guess I’d rather not try and try not to think about it than try and fail over and over until I die and it was for nothing. Wow I feel depressed now great video though.   Maybe we should de-stigmatize being ugly or just not beautiful. I don’t think I’m hideous but often feel that way. Idk. I’m rambling."
"i’m a trans guy and usually on days i feel really dysphoric i feel ugly. especially when i was a child and pre-t and pre surgery, to me looking fem was gross and i always hated how i looked. now that i’m almost 4 years on T i wont lie i stare at myself in the mirror sometimes and say to myself “shit you’re hot as fuck”. I feel like it has a lot to do with how we see ourselves in our head, when i was young i always wanted a strong jawline, facial hair and masculine features. now that i have that i feel comfortable about my physical appearence. maybe i’m just full of myself but i don’t know, feeling “attractive” has always been tied in to my gender as a trans person."
"A super fish... it took me a while to get that one."
"i was having a not so great week and so glad to see u uploaded :’) thanks mama points <3"
"The first G of van Gogh is pronounced the same. So guttural-o-gutteral.  You should also do whatever to achieve the way you want to look for whatever reason you deem valid to want to look that way. It is you who needs to be comfortable with yourself, if that's based on how other people perceive you, than that's a valid reason to strive for."
"TBH, if the NHS offered it, I'd take FFS long before bottom surgery even though think the later'll make me feel infinitely better; but mostly because I want to feel like I can pass without too much makeup and 30 minutes of selfie taking (I get told I pass in selfies; passersby IRL say otherwise). Because losing 30 minutes of my day feels almost as shitty as getting misgendered."
"How are your jowls now?"
"'If I'm out of bed it's because I'm running late for something' oof that one hurt, same."
"holy shit, she's outdone herself with the editing again!  repeat literally every episode, cause Contrapoints literally never stops demonstrating next-level aesthetics (especially in those openings Holy Shit)"
"New video, all is good in the world now"
"Seven seconds in and I hear SOPHIE playing and I had to pause to lose my sh*t for a minute. Carry on."
"Is Tabby retired now? I'm gonna miss that kitty if so 💜 But believe me I'm a cis woman who doesnt wear make up everyday, but that's due to mostly laziness and well financial strains. If I had all the money oh many I would be highlighting like crazy ✨"

"The curse of Beauty is that it is by it's definition unattainable - it exists outside of us, for us to strive for.  Even if attained, at least in the eyes of others, it's presence is fleeting, and you will resent it's absensce. The search for beauty fills us with fear, anxiety and inadequateness.  Beauty is suffering. It cannot be anything else.  The best thing we can do is to let go of our desires, and break free from our cravings.  Loving, peaceful kindness is possible. But it takes work. I like your work Natalie, but I believe that the path you have currently taken is one that will only torment you."

"God, I love you more and more each time i watch these videos."
"I, for one, am not grateful that you're wearing clothes."
"Great video as always! Your point about critiquing things is super real, and it's so fucked that by and large, the exact same people who actively work to drill into everyone's heads that their primary value comes from being 'beautiful' then turn around and shame people for doing all that they can do appear 'beautiful' (and thus, valuable). I feel like a lot of us spend more time beating ourselves up for wanting to fit into restrictive beauty standards than criticizing the people and industries most responsible for promoting those beauty standards in the first place, and that's not fair to ourselves."

"Don't get me wrong, I could never sympathise with anyone who is *that* obsessed with getting laid but too much of a fucking square to just hire a hooker or learn to present themselves as non-shitty on dating sites...  But I *think* the etymology of 'Skinmaxing' or whatever, is from the RPG term 'min-maxing.'  Just seems likely for people obsessed with social rejection, and who, from the outside, *seem* to treat being gamers as both a source of that rejection and symptomatic relief from it."

"'lesbians are chilling' I laughed because I am a lesbian and I definitely get where you're coming from. But I think an interesting study would be how queer women, whether they be lesbian or bi or pan etc perform femininity, and how on the flip side there are butches, studs, and gnc queer women. I don't know , the way queer women perform their gender aesthetic of choice always felt very different than how cis straight women did it."

"IT MUST NEEDS BE REMARKED  That self esteem is so often overlooked when it comes to someone's appearance.

I have been saving a bit from part time jobs just in case I ever want plastic in the future. But will it really help anything?   It honestly feels like this vanity will never ever go away. I can't just turn it off and love myself. The idea of not caring how I look is so alien to me  And it's not even me wanting to conform to beauty standards, or to get mates, I want to be aesthetic for myself and only myself 😅  Contra is honestly the strongest person I know, being able to stare at herself while editting videos and knowing millions are out there judging her appearance...meanwhile I battle mirrorphobia  Sigh....what a depressing video"
"you licenced sophie? damn"
"I’ve never felt beautiful.   Lol great video tho - imma go cry"
"You look like Sigrid Agren (supermodel from Martinique)."
"I can absolutely agree. I do enjoy the thought of feeling attractive to women while being gay, the desire to look beautiful is far from merely being  a mean of getting laid."
"This came at the perfect time. :) Love it."
"Not sure if this helps at all, but I didn't know anything about you when I watched my first video of yours, and the whole time I was thinking, 'gosh she's hot, I wish I could look as on fleek as her' and I didn't even know you were trans until you mentioned it. So either you're already lovely or I'm an idiot. Or both. ~A cis gal"
"DROPPED EVERYTHING FOR THIS, I love you so much, Natalie!"
"This isnt fair my inner magpie is very distracted by what can only be described as the best most extra top ever... so sparkly ✨ also you look like Selene Dion's niece and WEEEE STANNNNNNNN!"

"Slick Thompson reference. This is an interesting insight. I was wondering about wearing make-up, but I just like the face I see in the mirror. He looks kind and approachable, if a bit dopey."
"YAAAAAAAAAASSSS"
"cHOKE ME MOMMY"
"I definitely noticed something about your jawline post-FFS. And then it hit me.   You look a little bit like my (super-nice) ex-girlfriend. It's mostly the chin and hair. Which is fine."
"Ok I know you think it's just flattery and blah blah blah but Natalie you look amazing with makeup, but even without any makeup you look fish af!"
"I'd thought that little blue dot signifying a new Contrapoints video was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.     Then I saw Natalie in this video."
"Can you do a video about posadism?"

"15:44 the 'f' has me dying"
"You are beautiful, Natalie, both inside and outside."
"Oi, excuse you, I don't appreciate ungenerous guesses at my motives for walking around makeupless and unshaven. Mostly it's because I'm too lazy and too old to give a shit. And yeah, cis privilege, I know."
"Fucking yes"
"I’m listening to this beauty talk as I’m in the gym pump iron. Desperate to get my biceps piping and abs showing. Men have beauty complexes too look into steroid abuse in all the gyms."
"You always had a feminine beauty about you, but just moments into the video I spotted a noticeable difference on your face, especially the nose. Immediately realised why you were absent for nearly two months. 😁 You look fucking amazing!"
"thank you mutha"
"NEW CONTRA VIDEO EVERYBODY FREAK OUT"
"You are right about straight cis men considering plastic surgery. I’ve been considering reducing the size of my potato nose for many years because I HATE it."
"Gofundme to buy an endless supply of martinis for Natalie to sip and swirl while the jackals, vultures, and goblin swine hurl commentary."
"'Isn't it safer to just secretly fall in love with them while quietly dying inside?' wow I feel attacked 😫"
"You are a miracle in these dark days. Thank you."
"UM SOPHIE? YEA I THINK SO"

"I'm so glad she didn't premier this. I could watch from the beginning when I caught the notification 14 minutes upload."
"Our Dark Mother has blessed us with another masterpiece.   Thank you!"
"Nevermind sequins, Natalie's vocabulary and self-referencing is my ASMR. Her deadpan aside of 'F' meant that I had to pause the video to let my hilarity die down until I could hear the outside world again. (Put plainly, she has taught me her lingo and now I feel smart for understanding, good deal).   Also, yeah, lesbians be good, it's all chapstick and short black fingernails over here."
"😂 Which subreddit did that come from? I'd expect that comment would be deleted on others. Anyways, you're always cute 💖"
"nah lesbians got the dog filter on snapchat"
"goddess!!"
"as a legit retard i can say, this was a fairly good video"
"Bone structure is popping 👏🏻👏🏻 *stan voice* go off kween"
"contrapoints feature on the next sophie album CONFIRMED"
"At this point it's hard to tell what's better, Natalie's  production or SOPHIE's music production  :^)"
"I am generally not in favour of altering one’s appearance through surgery, but I am interested in the angle Contra gives here. I certainly don’t think it is invalid to be concerned with looks, but I was brought up not to be boastful or vain. Working to undermine my own ego of boasting when successful, or taking pleasure in my looks, has helped me be a happier person on balance, I think. There really is something to internalising and working towards a point of view less concerned with the physical, whether that is recognising that everyone has some feature you admire or consciously acting against, or at least recognising, your own biases around looks. I think that may be the deeper reason why some people don’t wear makeup/work on their appearance all the time, rather than arrogance or denial."
"17:10 loled"
"Mom is back home"
"Shout out to the Anastasia  Riviara pallet, which I also love 💕 your make up looks 🔥🔥"
"Natalie couldn't be more iconic if she tried"
"I thought your face looked perfect before, especially your nose, was soo sexy!"
"Can we get an *F* in the chat for all the men dying tomorrow?"
"Why do we want to feel beautiful? *Is it phones?*"
"Yes, your fantasies about what you want to look like interfere with your objective observation with what you do look like.  Here's Lookin' at You, Kid!"
"imagine my shock when this pops up in my recommended AND OPENS WITH FACESHOPPING IM SCALPLESS"
"Fine. This is fine. It's fine! Now Lindsay Ellis has to talk about the mouthfeel and the universes will be fully merged."
"There's so much fucking judgment against ppl getting cosmetic surgery. We all really need to get over it. If it's not your face, it's not your business."
"Let's talk about Tess Holiday. Please."
"No bricks! Milkshakes!"
"Bruh what???? You fucking pass, idek what they were talking about, maybe other trans women are more critical of what 'passing' even is than cis ppl, idk, u gorgeous"
"There’s nothing that brings me more happiness than when Natalie breaks character. I replay it every time"
"You look like a pretty lady to me, both before and after."
"Sis snapped"
"What? You look the same! Hot as fuck, but the same.  Joking aside, congrats."
"See Ethan? You can talk about Facetune and unrealistic expectations without being a dick."
"Never clicked on a link so fast!"
"Goddess Points"
"The further she gets in her transgender journey, the more she looks like Jenna Marbles... Just sayin'"
"Thank you for this video. I’m about 3years in to my transition and have been on hormones for about as long. So I’m at the point where I’m thinking about FFS. I feel like sometimes I don’t need it, but there’s definitely times where I think I look like the Incredible Hulk. Lol. Love you!"
"Okay I think I get it   womenbros use makeup and stuff to feel good about themselves and express their femininity     just like I work out and shave my facial hair in particular ways to feel good about how I look and express my masculinity through my physical form   also, I don't always agree with your politics but I would smash Natalie in her tight feminine front hole ;D"
"To be honest, even if I kind of see the difference, I thought your face was already very feminine before that last intervention. But I suppose that when you look at yourself in the mirror, you must see details that no one else would see but drive you crazy."
"You invented beauty, perfect angel, choke me mommy.  Here's your dopamine shot for the day, Queen. It's on the house this time. Cheers,"
"You looked great before, and look great now. And that dress. Biiiiitch please. 💗"
"It's nice. There were a couple quirks to the pre-surgery face I appreciated as 'cute' but there ain't no substitute for confidence and self-empowerment, which is already evident."
"I think my favorite parts of contra points is the lil bits of ASMR. I think if she made a video with an ASMR through line I will cry and relax"
"I'm a very honest person. And I think you look amazing okay??? Also I'm drunk so extra honestly."
"I just started watching this but I had to leave a comment because I'M SO EXCITED YOU'RE BACK! Okay, on to the actual video..."
"Oh boy I can’t do doctor talk"
"Contra has literally never disappointed. Praise the lobster queen ♥️♥️"
"The part at ten minutes makes it sound like the only reasons cis women have to not care much about cosmetics is if they're pressured by men, or if they're trying too hard to be 'not like other girls'.  Some men don't care about sports. Some women don't care about makeup.  For me, I'd like to look beautiful, I do care about how I look, and I get very self conscious sometimes. I have very feminine tastes. If I could wear princess dresses to work, I would. But I just don't really care much about makeup. It's super cool and I admire people who are good at it, but I generally can't be bothered to wear it. I don't feel that way because I'm pressured to (in fact I feel pressure to wear makeup) and I embrace being girly in my own way."
"A can't believe you invented beauty"
"Oh boy I am so hyped this intro is so good already"
"Lady Foppington!"
"Is hiding her stubble and attempting to suppress her jealousy; put more seriously,  you look amazing!"
"ohmygooood yesss shes back. Ive been promoting this channel all over the internet and so are others"
"Something about the way Natalie says 'BURGEONING' (7:44) makes me laugh so hard."
"Shut the fuck up you look beautiful all the time."
"i honestly got a minute in without reading the caption and thought you were kidding about getting surgery until i saw the before and after pics. im super suprised but i hope this lessens your dysphoria. love you Natalie"
"I'm never going to look at that Van Gogh painting the same way again."
"'To use the exact medical terminology– my brows on fleek, my nose is no longer busted the house, my jaw's snatched, and my adam's apple is cancelled.' 😭"
"I love that dress big time."
"Natalie looks like Kylie Minogue now"
"that unedited/edited pic of joan crawford <3"
"YOU INVENTED BEAUTY! PERFECT ANGEL! CHOKE ME, MOMMY!!!!"
"I live in South Korea and it is a misconception that Korean people want to look more western. There is no statistical data to support this.   Korean people don't know who Taylor Swift is. They are alot less engaged in western culture than you think."
"We love you, Natalie! ♥"
"Biological sequins"
"How dare you upload right now? I was just about to get some work done. Well, forget that."
"You look amazing!"
"Women are still competing with other women, against a certain societal standard of 'desirability'. There's also a link between the rituals that women do, and the idea of womanhood."
"M I L L I M E T E R S  O F  B O N E"
"No, how am I going to bed early now?"
"What a crazy change!! I have a nose like hers and I really want to change it. It is so cool how nice it looks now. I know that sounds silly... I am so insecure."
"Everytime one of your videos comes out, a lot of tiny bitemarks appear all over my fist."
"'it's hard being a 6' HA sames."
"Love u nat! Looking hot! Appreciate you!"
"30 seconds in holy shit this is high quality"
"she protec she attac bust most importantly  *she hecking bacc*"
"Omg did you call Peterson a daddy doll?!? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
"I wish I could afford this. ):"
"Instagram comments arent flattery, they are algorithm gaming attempts"
"my first reaction with that intro: OMG I love you."
"sisterCELS im dead"
"I don't know. I think you were more beautiful before, but that is probably just my personal taste in women. If you are happy, Im happy :)"
"The thing that shook me most about this video was having Gymnopedie as the end credits song. Nice, Zoe."
"tbh as a cis bi woman i feel way more connected to the way she speaks abt womanhood and beauty standards than any cishet woman. love u loads, contrapoints. also ur nails are gorgeous i want them please give them to me"
"You made me laugh at the risk of pulling my stitches, love it"
"woops idk how to be fashionable and stylish though"
"She's actually good at makeup though. I don't understand...And she's actually attractive too! I mean I'm envious."
"I'm still watching, but with respect to the sentiment that smart people aren't supposed to care about beauty... That may be so, but I think the intent behind that sentiment is that you aren't supposed to do anything about wanting to be beautiful, that is, undergoing surgery to be beautiful or what have you, because it reinforces (in some manner) the virtue that makes people discontent with themselves to begin with. I'm probably going to backtrack and delete this comment after getting fucking roasted in five minutes but, in the event that I'm not... Here you are!"
"just got back from fab drag bingo night, sooo ready for this now though"
"You are so👏🏼beautiful👏🏼"
"Well... We used to do philosophy and shit and now its make up and insecurity. Girls are weird."
"Itll be weird to get used to her new face"
"'Maybe she's born with it, maybe a surgeon peeled her face off and fixed her shitty skull!'™️"
"Fuckin best cam girl ever"
"I look like I have leprosy if I don't wear makeup."
"19:43 CALLBACK QUEEN!!"
"this is the best use of detective pikachu"
"The quality on these videos are insane now"
"I could not stop staring at that dress. The  biological sequence captured my full attention. I love it"
"Oh my gosh, I love your videos, but can I say, with all fairness it's strange to see you with a new face! It's going to take some getting used to, god I miss your old nose already! <3"
"Body neutrality ftw. It's normal to not feel beautiful"
"Did... did you use 'Aquarium' from 'Carnival of the Animals' as a subtle fish reference?"
"**palpates brow bone**"
"As a Dutchman i'd just like to say: 'Tnx for the correct pronouncement of Vincent van Gogh's name Natalie'."
"you look wonderful natalie :)"
"natalie, you are so beautiful, wise, and hilarious. <3 love u girl"
"Yare yare daze. This isn't even my final form! Over 9000!!!! This is when you go even beyond!!! AHHHHHHHHHHH! Feat.Tyler1"
"I just love your mind. Also, this psychedelic, mushroom, sequin top is making sweet love to my eyeballs!!!"
"this very question is why I keep hesitating on whether I want top surgery. I don't actually like, *hate* my breasts. I wish I didn't have them, but most of the time, they're just sort of there. they don't cause me great anguish or dysphoria. I'd love to be able to go to the beach or the pool without either wearing a swim binder or having my moobs flap around inside a wet rashguard for all to see, or, worse, nakedly visible for strangers to avert their children's eyes from. but that's like 90% a social reason. if other people were cool with me having a chest like this and not wearing a shirt over it, I honestly wouldn't mind having it. but they *aren't* cool with it, that's not what reality is like. the truth is, I get more psychological distress worrying about what other people will do when they see my body than my own brain could ever conjure when I look at it alone in the shower."
"cunty is the new mouthfeel"
"Lesbian here and while many of us are chilling by hetero society standards, trust me, there's a deep obsession with a nebulous 'lesbian aesthetic' and a lot of people posting selfies asking the group whether they've achieved it."
"The rare mid-section-exclusive mermaid is here to be and talk about beauty"
"I HAVE AN EXAM TOMORROW FFS CONTRA"
"Thank you so very much!!! I have been feeling guilty about wanting to be pretty by cis standards."
"Ugh, I just had surgery a few weeks, that shit is rough, no matter what you're getting done, and recovery is no better at first."
"Why didn't you just feminise yourself with soy milk? No need for surgery"
"Yay, it's been so long!"
"I was never beautiful, so I just worked hard to be smart. Even as an adult, I still try hard to be beautiful. Unfortunately, my big nose and my acne ruin it. I'm also short, curvy, and I have big boobs. :( I wish I had clear skin and could be skinny."
"CHOKE ME MUMMY"
"21:26 STOP THE FUCKING BAIT CONTRA"
"That is one hell of an intro"
"This doesn't matter but I really liked your face before. It's great now, too, but it was great before, too."
"1:20 into it and I can say this: wow amazing, you're incredible. Now, I'll watch it trough"
"https://youtu.be/MFkymds8C6I"
"Lesbians are straight chillin I guess"
"You're beautiful Nat <3"
"Just watched detective pikachu and I'm loving the reference. In my head it looks exactly the same :) going back to 16:21 now"
"You looked good before and you look good now. Glad you were safe and healthy"
"MOMMY"
"I agree completely that being beautiful is very important. and it's not only about how others perceive you. this body is me. I am in it all the time. so, yeah, if it's normal to want to live in a beautiful home, it's even more normal to want to be in a beautiful body. also, you want your inner beauty to shine and it is easier to make others see it if your body reflects beauty too. we all want to feel good and there is nothing that makes you feel more inspired and alive than beauty...a beautiful painting, cathedral, melody... why would human beauty be any different?"
"I absolutely love hearing you speak candidly about things so personal to you. Of course the humor serves to cushion the real feelings your grappling with here, but your sharing with us, whether political or personal, is always appreciated. (:"
"Shit, when you said this week, I didn't know you meant this this week."
"smart like Einstein nutted a load inside Mozart's bussy and shat you out whilst getting a rusty trombone from Vincent Van GHHOH"
"Holy fuck 35 seconds in and this shit got *REAL* real quick"
"I happen to think you are a very beautiful individual, especially in more natural and no makeup. The extra extravagant stuff is a little goofy looking but hey that's my subjective opinion :P i think you're incredibly gorgeous!!"
"I saw Kat Von D lock it in the background"
"So we can expect your ASMR channel next month, right?"
"So is there going to be a spin-off ASMR channel of press-on nails on sequins with softly repeating ContraPoints phrases over and over again like 'mouthfeel?'"
"'if all the men died tomorrow *(f)* I'd definitely keep wearing makeup'"
"Take a shot every time Natalie says 'journey.'"
"youre by far my favorite cam girl"
"“*gasp whispers* I’M A GIRL!”  Madeline Ashton is shook."
"I was having a bad day. This upload made it 1000x better.   Thanks Natalie"
"u r so cute ily"
"I can understand a person who was born with a malformation or a person who had an horrendous accident paying for surgeries, but beauty?? That's quite stupid and unnecessary, and the reason why I hate those fucking plastic surgeries  is due the bitches called Kardashian, what the fuck is wrong with them? Cannot they appreciate natural beauty, the best form of beauty ever created; most wonders on this planet are created naturally, the most fucked up things are made by us, war,  massive destruction weapons, chemical weapons, and etc."
"Came for the title, stayed for the sequins   Another great entry into the Contrapoints stan thank you very much."
"Nat you look great."
"holy shit that opener was amazing."
"You look good, you looked good before but idk about that dress. Doesn't the two  types of CHILDBEARING contributions create two kinds of people? What would we call them?"
"There go them skulls again"
"Contra it’s One o’clock in the night I need to sleep"
"*TRANS WOMEN ARE QUEENS*"
"I see a new contrapoints video. I hit the like button"

"C H O K E  M E  M O M M Y"
"I love you mom"

"CHOKE ME MOMMY <3"
"You like sophie?? WE STAN"
"'If all the men died tomorrow -' *pause* 'F' This is SENDING ME"
"I'm a simple man. I see a skull, I like and share."
"Contra points shouting out Lizzie from LAL is what I needed today!"
"that natural smile at 17:16 is one of the rarest and most adorable things I've seen"
"YO WE GOT SOPHIE IN THE FUCKING INTRO LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
"1 min and im aldready laughing because the shade thrown at beauty gurus is real.This especially funny that this is coming out in the midst of all the drama occuring in the beauty community. The vid was probably planned months ago but talk about perfect timing"
"Thank god I have my own office because I just slapped the desk so hard it echoed. Now I'm staring at my computer wide eyed, eager, and adoring– this is NOT the face I make when I open an email. BLESS YOU NATALIE!!!!!"
"GET OUT OF MY ROOM MOM"
"How the fuck am I 20,000+th it was just uploaded"
"Ah, Contrapoints. You describe the skull like no other."
"Sweet mother sweet mother Send your child onto me  For the sins of the unworthy must be baptized in blood and fear"
"yes, you came back!!! missed"

"New contravideo! \o/"
"16:20 'What is going through my head?' lol same  19:31 lol there it is again nice"
"Welcome back, queen. I missed you!"
"you look so amazing! <3"
"Thank you. I think it is sad, but I really needyou in this debate Natalie. I don't hate anyone for their personal requirements, but I often find that lefties are overly focused on the extemes and miss the vital changes in between."
"Holy crap the visuals on the opening sequence were awesome."
"I mean i think you're pretty beautiful no stan"
"Am lesbian, can confirm, straight chillin"
"First off, good video. Second, your eyeshadow blending skills are amazing, I'm always a sucker for a pink/purple gradient"
"HOW DARE YOU CUT THE PIKACHU CLIP 16:27"
"'mozarts bussy'"
"I HAVE HOMEWORK DUE IN AN HOUR BUT THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT"
"Another video!!! Girl, I was just watching your old videos wishing for an update."
"captions would make your videos more accessible ily"
"From the title I thought this was going to be a 30 minute still shot"
"Like Christmas."
"Well... holy shit you look amazing!"
"sophiiiiieeee <3"
"Literally first second of the video and SOPHIE is playing. You are a QUEEN Natalie."
"Contra!!! I have a six page essay due today!!! WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS TODAY?!?!!? WHY DON’T YOU LOVE ME?!?!"
"i actually got ASMR from the sequins bit thank you mama"
"OH MY GOD THE DETECTIVE PIKACHU"
"That is so rad."
"As a lesbian. No, i still wanna get my nose done. 😬"
"omg 9:42 made me choke on my orange vanilla coke laughing"
"Natile purpled up her eyelids.   Presumably this is because purple was the color of royalty to convey that she rules."
"I don't know what kind of pain Killer they gave her but i want the same!"
"Whenever Natalie uploads, I feel like I have been invited to some very important event. I click knowing I will be in for a treat and I don't skip a single second as if I am watching a movie."
"*sees the skull* yeah this is gonna be good"
"Yeah I think you need to make video on being fat because I done my research into the topic and I'm certain that it's evolutionary preference and not a societal one. Even the African tribes that like fatter women that are often brought up are lighter than a average American women."
"You are a goddamn goddess"
"Listen, Sweaty: you look great. Always have."
"Yay ive been waiting for a new video"
"I fucking love you and your journey"
"CAN SOMEONE PLEASE PUT IN CAPTIONS"
"Oh I've been looking forward to this so much. Hasn't disappointed. Thank you Natalie."
"💀"
"That shirt is fuckin on fleek."
"My god, she looks so fucking gorgeous I can't handle it"
"I can tell you, the first time I saw you (the incel video) I had NO IDEA you were trans. I did and do think you are incredibly beautiful. All the love.  <3"
"watched this with fnaf background ambience lol"
"As long as they dehumanize us by calling us 'FEMOIDS' they can not expect to get near to our genital regions!"
"THAT SEQUINS TOP DISLOCATED MY JAW! Thank you for being incredible, Natalie💖💜💛💚💙"

"sounds hot"

"Why don't you get muffin top implants?"
"that is some nice dress ,just interesting"
"Im crying because of the opening song. I love Sophie so much"
"contra-chan....this is a little CONTRAversial......"
"Ur tha best"
"you definitely pass, my mother in law watched one of your videos, and the only reason she knew you were trans was because you said so. and this was your incel video, so before your surgery. You're beautiful!"
"love some Sophie"
"her reaction to the asmr thing got me laughing"
"Fffuuuucccckkkkk gurl you get the ravages of time hypnosis too?"

"'A Few Millimeters Of Bone' sounds like the saddest porno in history."
"Glorious as ever"
"You do still look like you (which is awesome obviously), but I have to say your chin looks completely extra adorable. Also, thank you for all of this. (oh jesus with the sequins, I love you)"
"Glad u are back"
"OMG Sophie and contra in one video, we re crazy or what <3"

"I WAS LITERALLY JUST THINKING OF HOW MUCH I MISSED YOUR VIDS. Im 30 seconds in but you've got my like already 😄😄😄"

"Hell yes. New contrapoints is always welcome."
"I love every single one of those 600,000 sequins."
"you kinna look like Phoebe from Friends now, and that's good bc shes pretty i love her."
":50 “You mean so much to me. You’ve been with me since the beginning.”  It’s interesting to me that there is no “you” in this statement — not in any meaningful sentence. “You” might mean the audience, but that is constantly in flux (in size and composition)."
"Love your content! Your FFS worked out great, I can’t even tell you had work done. I mean once I saw the comparison it was obvious but good surgeon is what I mean. :)  Is Theryn Paul F. Tompkins?  Edit: PFT is a very stylish man"
"5:57 seemed hard to say omg"
"Omg you look so good! I'm so happy for you! Here's hoping you never read the comments on this video."
"you still look like a man"
"Um there is nothing more deeply feminine than the acquisition of jowls through age, no one worry!"
"Please give us more contrapoints ASMR. I need this in my life."
"Notification Squad here. ❤️"
"I got the notification on my phone and came running for my computer."
"For fu**s sake is all I heard..."
"Does your new bone structure affect the MOUTH FEEL?"
"you look so cute.. in love 😍"
"I stopped what i was doing at work to watch this"
"as a trans man, i know that devoid from societal cues i would till feel intense chest, facial hair, general, and hip related dysphoria. i also know that the dysphoria i get from how i sit and gesture and cut my hair is all completely caused by how it makes people look at me, or more accurately how i think it makes people look at me. additionally, i really desperately want to be perceived as handsome and buff, but i firmly believe i would want  those things had i been born cis as well, looking at my brother and father. it’s all very messy, and frankly it makes me feel weird and bad to think about it."
"First 2 minutes FREAKING ME OUT!...."
"I got the notification as I was looking through forums for plastic surgery and beauty procedures (brow lift, eyelid lift, rhinoplasty, coolsculpting, laser peels, laser hair removal) while shopping for eye cream and concealer. This might hit close to home for me even as a cis woman with serious body dysmorphia that just wants to look normal and like a 'proper woman' . The guilt I feel when trying to reconcile this with my feminist and leftists stances and wanting to uplift others and never have others feel this pain adds another layer of difficulty to the whole thing."
"There is alot of sounds in this video. Not hangover friendly in the slightest lol."
"3:26 new medical term, satan's apple"
"Ya look great! Love your pretty dress (top) too!"
"HERE WITHIN 8 MINUTES OF UPLOADING! I didn't think you could be more beautiful than you already were, but I'm wowed at the work those surgeons did. EDIT: My words are true, you are absolutely gorgeous. Also people seem to think that Facetune is some kind of new thing. I was using the Japanese app LINE camera way back when it was called Aillis which does the same stuff, and still then learned how to use Photoshop CS when I was 9. I am painfully aware of how I look, and last time I went to a convention and photos were taken on my boyfriends phone of me, I had him send me the images and didn't let him post them, so I could remove my double chin from them before setting them loose on the internet."
"Very much a fan of the vagina in the penis vs vagina debate. But Natalie reminds me that this is only a part fo the allure."
"Happy your recovered!"
"The fucking production quality. AMAZING. Also the more i see you, the prettier you get. Hopefully you get more confident."
"GIRL YOU HAD ME AT FACESHOPPING"
"1 minute in and uve already explained why i never posted any transition pics"
"How can a political commentary channel be so aesthetic"

"You look amazing, not that you didn't previously. & hilariously insightful as always."
"You invented beauty, perfect angel   💖💖Choke me M O M M Y💖💖"
"Where the fuck did you get the outfit worn in the intro?!?!"
"I am simple. You play SOPHIE and I click like."
"You look beautiful, Natalie - You're much braver than me. If I was transgender, I don't think I'd have the guts to go through that surgery."
"New face who dis"
"Okay but what's that bop in the beginning"
"Fuck that beginning music. Yes"
"I was thinking the intro music sounded like Ponyboy, lol. SOPHIE is so amazing."
"Natalie calling herself a cam girl is EVERYTHING and as a former cam girl, I stan"

"I feel like there can't really be a distinction between FFS as a medically necessary surgery and as a cosmetic surgery because like, if you're going to do all the difficult parts of cosmetic surgery for medical reasons anyway, why not just go a bit further and make yourself more beautiful while you're at it?   EDIT: I haven't finished the video yet so feel free to put scarequotes around 'beautiful' in that sentence if that would make for a more appropriate comment."
