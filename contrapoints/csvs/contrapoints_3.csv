"Blaire White? More like Blaire Witch, yameen?"
"If there is worshiping of Our beloved holy mother Anita Sarkeesian i must smash that like-Button!!"
"If there’s anyone I’d listen to about which trans person is the “real” trans person, it’d be the failed musician who had to change his entire image because he traced a cartoon bear"
"I laugh at that intro everytime"
"wow milo stewart is in the video they went to my school that’s crazy"
"If only people who look and act like women should be allowed in Women's bathrooms, does that mean Butch Lesbians should also be excluded? And if they are worried about people who 'aren't woman enough' coming into women's bathrooms, shouldn't gay men also be excluded because they don't correspond to the typical image of a man?"
"Contra = eggg"
"She told me to blow myself with a blow torch- owwwwwwwwwwwww 😂😂😂 why are you  so hilarious"
"I think she confused the privilege of being a woman with pretty privilege... there’s a difference"
"'I'm not a victim. I'm NOT a victim!'  Ok Tiffan-oops I mean Blaire."
"Trans people are the most honestly people in the world, especially in 2019"
"Where are the spanish subtitles, dude?   The Latinoamerican people need them."
"guys, Blair was violently raped before she transitioned.. she talks about it in her video with shane."
"Ah, vintage Contrapoints🍷🍷🍷☺️"
"So Blair is a transwoman equivalent of 'I'm not like other girls~' GAG."
"lmao she thought she wasn't trans"
"Blaire saying we should be happy that ‘people’ (men) open doors for us and smile at us (women smile too but what’s the real “privilege” in women smiling at women) is the same argument that people use when they say we should we happy that men cat call us. It’s stupid. Like, I open doors for men and I smile at men do they don’t receive some degree of privilege for that? Oh wait"
"hearing Natalie’s voice pre transition is WILD she’s come so far and I’m so proud of her journey"
"'not challenging the status quo is the new punk rock' - Blaire White"
"Ah, tokens.  Otherwise know as, “I like you only because you’re a minority that’s useful to my bigoted narrative only by the way of you parroting it, however if you ever stop saying what I want you to, I’ll throw you under the bus without hesitation.”  These types of people think that being a house slave is better than being a field slave, instead of asking why they’d want to be a slave in the begin with.  Her and Milo both."
"as a cis person, i have privileges. as a woman, i do not. as a person with a moderately conventionally cute face, i have privileges. it ain't that deep blaire, your privileges are because you're gorgeous."
"Blaire is the original “not like other trans women” trans woman #notlikeothertranswomen #imacooltranswoman"
"The questions he was asking her..:what a disgusting pig. Who is that loser anyways? Actually spare me I could not give a shit"
"'Don't call human beings it'... nooo. You don't say? 😳"
"The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion's Dark Brotherhood reference is a yes"
"Blaire White be like “I’m rich as fuck as trans people who aren’t rich aren’t valid”"
"so this video is just about how blaire doesnt like feminism and has rational points about transgenderism ok then  i agree blaire 100% because im also trans im conservative i pass enough but i do sometimes get misgendered but i dont go on about how thats RUDE AND IM NOT A GIRL i just get on with my day i dont care that people think being trans is weird i know that trans people are more discriminated against but when people say that trans people are always oppressed i disagree always  wow you got mad because bearing was asking personal questions on a fucking questionnaire about blaire ok but then you start to make a point about saying that stuff on the street what moron are you they are talking to each other about different things why is it bad that he asks personal questions and how does that attribute to say the same thing on the street people who get offended at every little thing anyone does like calling a trans woman a man and starts going on a tirade when they accidentally said man are idiots and if they do it on purpose tell them what trans is and if they still dont listen ignore them is it that hard wow so you said that its easier to accept blaire an actual trans woman instead of the non binary shit who has weird jars everywhere and a fucking saftey pin in their nose mhm no what blaire acknowledged was that its easier for pretty women to be more accepted by any society (same with men) not that because blaire passes well and a fake trans person doesnt so you werent trans 2 years ago and now you are ummm ok all your points are just stupid"
"ooh ouch. she's been reaching for years. giggling at obvious bigotry thrown in her face. Blaire. come on."
"persephone is fucked over now haha"
"it's easy not to have a 'victim mentality' when you're never a victim, blaire."
"Natalie back in these days may have been the biggest egg I’ve ever seen"
"Thankyou for the insights and observations, Natalie... And for pointing out that, no matter how accepting our society becomes of 'other' gender/sexual orientations, beautiful people will ALWAYS enjoy overly privileged treatment and the 'less blessed by beauty' people will always be dismissed and even ignored... wish I could say humanity is evolving beyond that. In case anyone is wondering,  it IS uncomfortable when one shoves one's testicles up into the inguinal canals and sounding hurts like a sonofabitch if not properly medicated meditated and lubricated.. I know nobody asked; I'm just extrapolating the junk question issue.  Maybe to show off:/"
"3:11 huh so that’s where it started"
"This is so weird to watch in 2019"
"Some of this was accurate and some of it was far from accurate, such as trying to make bearing look like he was going after fat unattractive people. No, he was going after delusional people who were making videos saying fat is healthy (obesity) or that they're hot and everyone should do stuff for them (when widely agreed subjectively they're not) I haven't seen any argument that had to do with their appearance unless it was tied into something they said about their own appearance."
"wow, I cant believe how far you´ve come in just 3 years, I mean I love your old videos, but you seem much more mentally healthy in your newer stuff, much less self loathing."
"An Oblivion reference??Can I double subscribe To your Channel?? Contra ❤❤"
"Jeez, leave Natalie alone. Bunch of smart arse cunts."
"here after watching blaire's new video"
"It´s so weird to watch these old  videos with my current impression of contra ponits."
"Natalie wtf"
"I. MISS. THE. OLD. CONTRA."
"parts of this really haven't aged well omg"
"“Us cis people” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
"Oh, Dark Mother, you young fool."
"pandering is so fucking embarrassing i literally cant"
"You suck...and your not even very good at it."
"Trans people that indulge these alt-right fuckwits, such as Bearing, make me really sad... Do they not see how they're being used as tools to justify their bigotry?"
"'us cis people' lol me too natalie"
"It's the mouth feel! At least that's what I have heard"
"Respect and friendship are earned. They aren't something that people deserve. Yes people deserve basic decency, but I think where a lot of people disagree is on where that line is. The anti SJWs seems to believe that the line is lower, thus people should have the freedom to be mean or say hurtful things to others because they have the right to do so. Meanwhile feminists seem to think that kind of thing is violent and unnaceptable. My point is it is not a given that bearing owes and transgender or any other people kindness"
"why does the anita sarkesian meme never get old?"
"The beginning of AS A TRANS-WOMAN!!"
"An egg"
"So weird watching this after she HAS transitioned!"
"Omg. Contra now has more subs than Blair. I love that at a deep, quiet, vindictive place in the depths of my soul."
"'I don't know what it's like to be trans' hmhmhm, that is *not* correct"
"eep would it be possible to reupload this with the r word bleeped?"
"Anyone who prays to Anita fucking Sarkeesian is a total idiot."
"I'm gonna have to disagree on the whole 'she doesn't get offended easily' front. Usually with antifeminists, all you have to do is say the word 'toxic' or dress funny and they lose their fucking minds."
"All those 'benefits' or so called privileges doesn't come for free, as they are advertised. Men aren't nice to women for the sake of kindness. No no no"
"Baby trans in denial :D"
"So if I were young and pretty, oh and passed, then I could be cool too?"
"Oh, Oblivion reference, hell yes!"
"If someone wants to become a trans woman, then understand that your appearance will be under scrutiny constantly. Because that's how women live their lives. Sucks but that's life right."
"LOL do they still make nbomes???"
"ballon fetish . ? whut"
"When I meet a person who is like me, I can't help liking them.  Since humanity isn't really a thing yet, I don't like everyone."
"it seems he only finds her 'cool' because she says and acts like he wants her to act..."
"rewatching this video, i do feel like Blaire definitely jumped on the bandwagon of youtube fame and earned herself some clicks by just being edgy. in her earlier videos she was calmer and more thoughtful, now she just screams cringe at anything"
"In this day and age, I imagine that people are being “disowned” and have “a lot of shit happen” to them for more than being a transgender. I think it may have something to do with a personality those people found to be a flaw, especially once it becomes more bold upon transition. But what do I know I’m a white straight women who has never clashed with another persons personality (sarcasm). I may not agree with someone’s religion of politics, religious beliefs, life changing decisions, etc, but I make it a point to treat people the way I would want to be treated. That is until I can’t take their mistreatment and hypocrisy anymore. That’s when I realize their personality flaws clash with my personality flaws and it’s time for both to go opposite ways. I can’t imagine why anyone’s personality would clash with persephone’s personality based on the comments she leaves (sarcasm)."
"I haven't paid much attention to those who think like Blaire White lately. This video gives me another reason not to! Thank you!"
"I've been shotgunning the older videos for a couple days now and I still have no idea what Contrapoints really thinks about Anita Sarkeesian."
"The Anita Altar will never not make me laugh."
"Bearing is a disgrace to bears. He does not represent the rest of the bear community."
"So Blaire White is that trans girl who's picture is at the tob of the trans porn subreddit...hmmm interesting"
"That Anita Sarkeesian as the Night Mother joke was fucking gold 😂"
"I don't know does Blaire lives, but everywhere else the world is not any kinder to woman. Seriously."
"7:46  I don't know why this made me laugh as hard as it did."
"'us cis folks'"
"Bearing fancies Blaire. It's pretty obvious 😂"
"You're such a magnificent weirdo! I love it! I am the east, and you are the sun. 😘🤣"
"Didn't that bear guy get sued by Cartoon Network because the bear is just a shitty redraw of a screencap of that exact character ripped right from one of their shows for young children?"
"Psst... I know who you are... *hail Anita*"
"25i-nbome I can see you're a woman of culture"
"Bearing attitude about what is being cool reminded me to little kids who call cry baby another kid that gets hurt or offended. Also reminded me to a high school friend who liked to hit others (not like a fight, like a hit on the arm) or say offensive jokes; he also called us too sensitive when we asked him to stop being an asshole. He also thought that the ones who tolerated his bad behavior are 'cool'."
"Blaire and the other guy are operating on the assumption that fat, retarded, or offended people don’t deserve basic human respect, that they are somehow lesser people. But just because they don’t fit societal norms doesn’t mean they don’t deserve to exist in peace. Different doesn’t equal invalid."
"Wow. I can’t believe you. Looking into nbome’s. Not even once."
"I think SJW/feminist/trans/etc just miss the point: everyone hate everyone else, the reason is irrelevant. People hate their neighbors, people from a part of the town hate people from another part of the town, people of a town hate people of the city near to theirs, near from a region hate people of other region, people from a country hate people of other country, than sex, color of skin, tradition, political view, food preference (pineapple pizza), and so on. Where there is a group there are people outside the group, and they are wrong (lol). I truly bevilieve that fight for one kind of people (gay, trans, etc) makes that group an outsider and than makes 'grow' a resentment about them. To be racist against withe is not good, talking about 'black lives matters' only put the 'me vs you' kind of feeling that is the core problem about racism. Making a group is become an opposition to others, and that's the opposite of overcome racial prejudice. My mother is a 'bad femminist' and she say all the time things likes 'women are better than men', and my very young nephew after a while started to respond to her with 'women are whiny', even if everybody else always teached to him that 'male and female are equal'. If you separate your 'kind' from the 'normal people' you will be an enemy. I know it's hard to be perceived as 'normal' (none is normal, none is actually perceived o think about himself 'i'm normal') and i have no idea how to overcome this. It's so hard to let think 'white males' that they are on the same boat of other groups that proclaims all the time 'we are not like you people, fuck you' (that's the perception i have about feminism and sjw as a white male on the web, maybe because bad messages are 'louder', i don't know). If you want an 'inclusive society' stop exluding yourself, stop the difference 'we against them' and just.. be what you are."
"Ohh natalieee <3"
"In presents day contrapoints enter the women bathroom slaying the  fem aesthetic queen stile."
"I see that ContraPoints has really taken the full plunge into womanhood by indulging in the classic womanly act of reading-way-too-fucking-deep-into-everything."
"“I’m one of the ones that shouldn’t be allowed in female bathrooms” well that did not age well."
"*Foreshadowing...*"
"'Im not trans' oh how times have changed"
"Bearing ain’t shit, but the only defensive I can give him is that Blaire is his friend, and she probably agreed beforehand to answering intrusive questions, so it’s different from pestering trans people you barely know. But, as you said, he does seem to imply that everyone who talks about inequality is “not cool” by comparison, hence why he ain’t shit.  Edit: YOU CALLED TRIGGLYPUFF RETARDED HAHAHAHA ok I love you even more"
"lol... You arent trans' oh girl i feel this dont look back kinda ethos.  hey  i love you your are wonderful and beautiful and smart and funny and strong and... and you FUCKING DOING SHIT!  youre a pretty cool role model"
"I can feel the gender dysphoria in this video ._."
"blaire white is a joke. if she would have grown up in a state like mine with a family like mine she would have not gotten nearly as far as she did . ive knew a person back in 2015 who passed as cis female who worked hard till one day she was outed by someone and a bunch of guys beat the living shit out of her such as life"
"You were so charming..."
"This video has aged quickly"
"I’d say when their body temperature is below average"
"Whats an Uncle Tom...hearing the term alot in the comments and id like to know"
"On the future of 2019, YouTube has forgotten that Bearing ever existed."
"Some people use It/that pronouns. One friend of mine does so I can only imagine that it isn't the only one."
"This is like the black kids that grow up in suburbs and say things like “I’m black! And I don’t mind when white guys say n...”  You might not mind, because you aren’t living the worst of that reality. You are sheltered from what your brothers and sisters see on a daily basis. You never lived at a time when that word meant “I can buy/sell/humiliate/kill you if I feel like it n...” And you don’t speak for all black (trans, etc.) people. Especially when you don’t recognize their struggle, even though you are so similar or related to them by blood or by life experience."
"Blaire is such a pick me ass bitch."
"Haha just created a YouTube channel just for this, 2019 baby never had one. Anywho 25i nbome I was taking that shit in 2011 and this is the first time I've seen it anywhere. Love the channel."
"lol you have so great clothes :)"
"Why are your videos all amazing"
"'if you're really making the effort to try to look the part'  yeah what a douchy thing to say its pretty condescending to people like me, who can't afford to fully transition yet"
"'I'm not trans and don't know what it's like to be trans' these videos are so strange to watch years later"
"Blaire 'female' privilege would be 'beauty' privilege. I'm average looking and people don't smile at me or care about my well being in public. I would be deserving of such treatment if I wear a nice dress (not too sexy mind you) and a bunch of makeup."
"you don't wanna fuck with NBOMe"
"Was that intro supposed to be a Skyrim Dark Brotherhood joke?"
"Blair White never received any hate because she never willfully divulges that she's trans.  She's Clayton Bigsby if Clayton Bigsby had never taken off the hood."
"*I'm not trans*"
"I only subbed like a weak ago and have been watching these vids in no particular order both pre and post embracing a trans identity, is there a specific video were she 'comes out' as it were?"
"will Blair age well?"
"“Us cis folks”"
"*Women who don't fit models of attractiveness get treated worse than other people because women are expected to be pretty* Pretty Woman: 'I don't get why youre whining, everyones nice to MEEEEEEEE'"
"NBOMe... 8 hours of hell followed by trapped nerves and sciatica. Fuck that stuff"
"Blaire interprets people being nice to her as a woman as evidence that women actually have greater privilege than men. The reality is, she isn't being treated nice because she's a woman, but because she's a pretty woman. Unattractive women are not treated well in our society, so the fact that she, as an attractive woman, is treated well, demonstrates just how important feminism actually is."
"AS A TRANS WOMAN"
"How many people, if any, have been arrested because they used a toilet, other than the one of their birth sex? Can't imagine too many town sheriff's wasting their deputies time on this??!!"
"I fucking hate bearing. I used to be part of the anti-sjw community. He was one of the reasons I left that group. He’s a shitty person and his political points are all around awful. He’s literally just a dick instead of an insightful person he himself acts like the people he hates often by arguing by insulting the person and not debating the argument."
"i wonder if blaire is still on her anti feminist bullshit"
"Are you sure you’re not trans? Are you sure you don’t know what it’s like?"
"Blair was really beautiful right out of the box and I think she's went totally overboard in trying to look like a woman to the point where she passes significantly less now than she did in these first few videos.   I know other trans people (including Natalie aka contrapoints) who are the same and wanna get surgery here and Botox there. I think this might be an issue that we should discuss and try to prevent because it's like a paradox of not feeling good enough and then going through with surgery that might make you pass less, make your life harder.  I think the politics surrounding trans people and the massive rejection of them right now might be a big factor in this mentality of never feeling good enough. It's something I hope we can mend over time."
"WAS THAT A MOTHERFUCKING ELDER SCROLLS REFERENCE!?"
"As a cis white male I know I am basically Lucifer, but for whatever it is worth comming from meI really apreciate your work. You are comming from probably the most difficult of places and you own it. And you have over time moved me from sypathy for trans people to genuine respct."
"He’s just nice to her because he thinks she’s hot"
"Lol'd at the N BOMB browser tab."
"ive only been subbed for a few days and have only now started digging this deep into her videos, but wow i am equally turned on by her pre to her post. Hellloooooo Nurse!"
"“I’m not Trans” oh just wait sweetie!"
"She's perceived a cis woman who is white... Of course she wouldnt go through a lot of shit minority women or trans in early transition (or whome do not easily pass) women go through... This doesnt invalidate white women who experience misogyny. I believe all women do, but clearly not Blair White..   She doesnt want to be seen as the victim because she craves for acceptance from all angles and probably hates herself and represses her emotions and thats the real tea sis"
"25i-nbome... oh man.. potent shit."
"it's kind of weird to hear natalie's pre-e voice, i'm just so used to the *aS A tRANs wOmAN* shtick that i just forget your voice wasn't always the same"
"There is only one Blair that I can bear, and I do declare, it's Blair St-Clair"
"I think if she wasn’t cis passing and as conventionally attractive as she was and made a utube, it’d be a completely different Blaire white. Not to say she didn’t work hard to look as good as she does and to have as smooth of a transition and this definitely shouldn’t be downplayed (ykno in spite of what it says about the fact that trans ppl have to bend over backwards to confirm to conventional and useless gender roles but whatever), but because of this she seems incapable of empathy regarding the trans community. It’s kinda like a vicious cycle tho. She has a bad experience with the trans community because of some of her more concerning actions online and makes a video on it. The trans community hates her even more and this gives her more conviction to her disscontempt with other trans ppl and it goes on. Like you said her first few vids were genuine and quite good but she was unfortunately edged into the anti sjw mould as most ppl on this website are. A shame really"
"This reminds me of the, 'cool girl' part from Gone Girl"
"All antisjw are part of a sjw but worse. And we should stop talking about privileges, because each of them has a price that you have to pay. For example, everyone pays attention to good looking people, but they are also harassed every day for that. Skinny people do not have to deal with negative comments, because comments find them and they are really mean, from people who tell you that you need milk to people who make fun of you because you feel bad after winning a couple of pounds"
"On the other hand, Blair, Milo, Ben, are the toys of these anti-sjw groups, they are there to be 'the gay, trans, jewish friend, etc.' so that they can argue that they are telling the truth, and that they are not just fobs because they have these friends who are not white and heterosexual men"
"Nice food for thought Simple but not simplistic, bringing up points left and right and trying to provoke thought instead of reactions"
"Blaire should wait tables for 15 years, and then revisit her 'the world is so kind and welcoming to women hypothesis'. Perhaps a pretty Youtuber who comes across as a token trans woman for the alt right lacks an everyday woman's perspective."
"'I'm not trans and I don't know what it means to be trans' damn this video did not age well Natalie"
"Marry me."
"I would proudly date Blair , but I love your mind Contra !"
"Great make-up small manicured hands and feet long nipples and no penis, ooops forgot I'm straight ; but open minded."
"I have some genuine concerns for marginalized people who associate with and feed into the warped views of sexists, racists, bigots and nazis. Like it's really sad that they feel like these people who really just hate them are right and don't realize they're being used by these asshats to push their agenda and keep marginalizing them."
"Yes, part of what's cool about her is the fact she's not easily offended in a day where ppl are offended by anything, and everything b/c it shows maturity and class. That doesn't mean that ppl that complain about real injustice aren't cool but, rather the extremist that limit their personality to victimhood, and see everything w/ let's-look-for-something-to-be-offended-by glasses aren't cool. Some of the complaints are valid, like about lack of rights for the gays & lesbians to get married, trans to go in the bathrooms they choose, ect.  but then u have crazy ppl like Riley J Dennis who thinks lesbians are transphobes for not liking p3n!s, claiming it to be a female part which ironically not only erases lesbians by demanding we suck and fk d!ck like many cis het males would, but erases trans ppl as well by telling them their is no biological differences in the sexes so there is no need for transition and lesbians and hetero males should just accept their c0ck in their @$$ even though it's unwanted. Both the extreme right, and the extreme left are hypocritical fake af whiny bigoted hateful nuts in my opinion, just in diff ways. So yeah, I like the fact she's so laid back, and while I don't agree w/ everything she says 100% of the time (like the idea of female privilege for example, it's naive and I would gladly reverse these 'privileges' for equal respect of ideas, not being sexually harassed and being less likely to be raped, abused, ect or that the bathroom situation isn't a problem for trans that really try to pass, ect.), but I respect that she's not afraid to say it, that she can think for herself, she's at open to new ideas, she's not easily offended and that she's not a fake. Like u say, all that is refreshing these days. While she says tranny, it's in the context of how black ppl will say 'wazz up my nigga'. It's done in love, and not in hate, kinda like re-claiming the word, and taking away it's power. Idk if anyone should or can be a spokesperson for any group. Ppl are individuals w/ diff ideas on how to fix the world, regardless of what label they fall under, and every human on this planet is highly flawed. I don't think anyone is a perfect example of how to be. That being said I love both u, and Blaire. I think ur both great people. Both outspokenness, free-thought, and being laid back are things that help to make anyone cool, and regardless of not agreeing w/ some of what she says, I think it's ridiculous to demonize someone for not thinking exactly the same b/c nobody agrees on everything, and ppl are all human and make mistakes. To expect perfection will eventually alienate everyone for we all fall short of the glory."
"Mock + joke + shaming = anti-SJWs"
"I don't get why Sarkisian now represents feminism to so many people. Her ideas are mostly second wave 101 and not really unique."
"oh god, why Anita? She's just a conwoman. I'm sure there are real feminists too"
"Hahahahahaha I'm not trans"
"I don’t think Bearing admires Blaire. I think he exercises flattery in an effort to use her as a tool. You know, tokenism. All these red pill neckbeards care about is their race, their worldview & their image."
"Fuck “the world is kinder to you” yeah and all the creepy unwanted male attention with hidden sexual pretenses  is so kind and nice... except for the fact that those men wouldn’t respect me as an equal in a professional environment"
"Am I missing something with this whole Anita Sarkisian thing? I feel like I am not in on the joke someone tell me."
"ничего"
"She's gross. I could go on YouTube and talk about how I personally don't face racism, as people tend to identify me as 'exotic' rather than a Native American, so therefore, all Native people are overreacting to the way society treats us. I'm not a victim.  But that would not only be disrespectful, dishonest, misleading, and untrue for virtually every other Native, it would denigrate a very real and very serious problem in our society. Native people face insane discrimination, and make up ten times the population average of those missing, murdered, and incarcerated.  That's what she's doing. She's saying that SHE doesn't get the shit kicked out of her for daring to dance with a man without announcing the status of her genitals. SHE wasn't disowned by her family and forced into prostitution to survive. SHE has never been publicly humiliated when she just wanted to go pee. So therefore those problems don't exist? No. Fuck her. She is silencing the voices of thousands of people who don't WANT to be victims, but are victimized on a regular basis. Against their will. That's what victimization is.  She has moments where she acknowledges her privilege, but she just resumes deriding the experiences of most trans people immediately afterwards, so she either doesn't realize or doesn't care what she's doing to her own community. Community being other people living the same experience of being trans.  Most people tend to guess half a dozen races before I just tell them. I've had people say, 'Oh. You're just too pretty to be Native!' like I'm supposed to take that as a compliment. But that's how society sees my people. It is ugly, disgusting and totally unfair.   I won't let anyone exempt me from the experiences of the hundreds of Native women who are missing that cops won't even look for. From my grandmother's generation that were abducted from their families and forced into residential schools where unspeakable things were done to them. From the Native people who have garbage thrown at them, who have slurs spit at them, who end up beaten to death in a river. From the millions of Natives who have been killed in the largest and longest running genocide in the history of humanity. I won't disrespect them by telling the public how my individual experience has been free of abuse, or laugh and thank someone that tells me I'm too pretty to be Native.  Blair White should be ashamed of herself and the enormous negative effect she's having on the progress that has been so hard won by the trans community thus far. She has no right to do that. She's wrong to think that she has any authority to speak on anything but the privilege she has as a trans girl that looks like a pretty cis girl, and she should be angry on behalf of all the trans women who get abused and treated like perverts in wigs, because they don't look like her. What a disgraceful way to impact the world."
"Blaire is the perfect example of 'I'm not like other transfolk!!!' and that is why she's toxic. I was subbed until I realized how horrible she is. I saw her video about 'detransitioning' and she isn't even going to detransition. She's simply going to stop taking hormones and try to get her sperm count up to hopefully be able to reproduce. She is still going to identify as a woman. She just wanted to use the whole 'LOOK AT ME I'M DETRANSITIONING!!!' thing as clickbait and thus adding more negativity to the trans community because 'Oh look, another transperson who regrets transitioning!' and it really just gives those people who hate transfolk more reason to believe that people who are trans shouldn't be taken seriously and are mentally ill."
"Blaire is disgusting and problematic. She has no issues attacking her own community with no remorse for the sake of being the 'cool trans chick' to cuckservatives."
"'Look the part' I'm a woman and I have a difficult time 'looking the part' most days."
"Oh my God. You're a looner."
"Ugh. I would hate Blaire White if I didn't feel so sorry for her."
"I can still hear the gay man in Blair's voice. Hilarious."
"Blaire had two good ideas, and since then she’s made it extraordinarily obvious that she lacks intellect. Natalie’s debate with her was so sad, man. Blaire had nothing to say."
"LMFAO @ 25I-NBOME"
"Now I want to know if a balloon fetish is a thing"
"The LGBT community is all fucked up. Especially the trans community. I think because there are so many unemployed weirdos out there 'representing' trans people. Blair White is doing you a favor."
"In my short little adventure, less than 6 months, I already have reason to be concerned about my safety and am getting hit on by my boss, whom is gay.... Currently I'm just a slightly pretty guy that likes to wear somewhat neutral clothing living in the DC area(a relatively enlightened city on these things). I guess she never left the house when she was transitioning."
"Yehhhhh I dont think she can claim that women have any kind of universal privilege. She is experiencing hot girl privilege and most women don't get that. And the ones that do are due for some serious disappointment when they begin to age."
"Seriously well done 👍"
"Men who mask into females are nothing but weak men.. This is your reproductive strategy.. You cant ir dont want to feed your self.. So you are looking for a host.. That will help you reproduce........ Eventually.. Remeber.. We are all playing reproductive game.. All kinds of complicated algorithms"
"Actually made me giggle when you said you're not trans and don't get to speak for trans people, even though I did indeed watch your videos before you started transitioning, hahaha! :-D"
"You are beautiful!  The bear sequence at the beginning of the show reminded me of my friend.  My friend was institutionalised at 22. After three days the psychiatrist met her for the first time.... He sat with her for fifteen minutes and diagnosed her with schizophrenia... She left after 10 days because ( maybe she wasn’t?)  During her time there She didn’t really feel the need to talk to anyone. Her only comfort was a teddy bear she had since she was a kid. Every morning at 5-6 am the nurses would come into her locked room to take her blood pressure.... one day there was a new 6’5 nurse who entered her locked room with 3 other woman... he entered and said” oh that’s a nice bear( to her stuffed animal) and then told her that he had a big bear near his house that would “rip her bear in half” .....  who’s strange?  She left after 10 days and is still travelling the WORLD today..."

"Every time I hear a boy say insightful things about trans people followed by 'but i'm not trans so i wouldn't know' I can't help but think, they're probably not really a boy"
"Natalie, as much as looking back at yourself probably causes dysphoria, and I don't in any way want to contribute to that, knowing that you didn't consider yourself trans merely 2 years ago is actually really encouraging to me going through a similar thing. I'm non-binary/trans, and all I hear are stories from people about how they 'knew they were trans as far back as they can remember' and this was not the case for me. I was deeply, deeply closeted and only came to this solid conclusion a couple years ago in my late twenties, and the imposter syndrome has been unrelenting. But, finding out that we have so much overlap has been really cathartic."
"Natalie has now stolen the crown for coolest trans chick in the universe"
"Oh shit, you have video proof of when Blaire's nose wasn't mangled by a plastic surgeon, neat."
"I don’t being a trans chick is inherently cool or uncool - it is a solution to a discomfort.   Self care is really cool!"

"I swear, the YouTube Algorithm must be fascist.  I use to listen to these anti-SJW activists shoved in my feed all the time.  But I did not get ContraPoints until like 3 years later."
"Found your channel recently and I have to say, thank you for all your hard work, your videos are so well thought out and well constructed! You're incredible!"
"Rolling through some old Contra videos and it does not surprise me AT ALL that that Bearing guy is from Australia (at least by his accent). So many goddamn fuckwits in this country. Just so you know, by his accent, you can tell he's a fucking bogan. Fucking gross."
"Muh boy Contra is a sexy lil thang AND has played oblivion?  Gawt dayum. *fans self*"

"NEKSNDNDDKSNDBDIDIE “I’m not trans” yeah ok"
"'Be cool' is what you say when you want someone to acquiesce to the same conservative bullshit you had to internalize to become part of the bro-group. 'Be cool' means 'show deference, act like you like me, don't threaten my delicate good mood with ideological challenges, and this won't become awkward.' It's a really effective psychological tactic to make someone think that agreeing with you and setting aside their convictions & desires is somehow virtuous. It gives them an illusion of control by implying that the goodwill of the exchange is in their hands, if they only do exactly as you please - 'be cool' is what you say to a girl when she's hesitant about blowing you at a frat party."
"scalding hot take: blaire is a 'cool trans girl' bc she repeats a lot of shit transphobes say & caters to the edgy anti sjw scene"

"<3 u"
"There is a 'don't be a victim of the world/universe' new-age thing going on (aka be a happy loving easy-going person all the time, and you'll 'manifest your desires' aaaayyyy) and it's really weird how that idea merges with the anti-SJW, anti-feminism idea.. both ideas involve a lot of denial. With the whole positivity-only-movement, not-happy people are perceived as not cool/chill and it's all around irritating that I can't be unhappy or depressed or anxious without being told it's up to my thoughts. In a sense it is, I'll admit. How does one get another one out of denial? Talking about your real life experience doesn't seem to help, even though research in discrimination says that is what helps - telling the person oppressing you how you feel when you're being oppressed. But the sick victim-shaming still happens, and the oppressed is then endlessly mocked, blamed, and bullied. I wish there were a magic sparkly that could bring people out of denial of other peoples' and their own experiences and pain.   I sometimes wonder if these people filled with hate just hate themselves so much they can't see it. Maybe I'm wrong.   Thank you for the channel! I love it <3"
"OMG THAT INTRO!!!! HAHAHAHAAAAAAAHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHAAA!!!!"
"BUT YOU ARE TRANS BLANCH, YA ARE"
"I understand your point on the dangers of her mentality, but I still;l dig someone who doesn't play victim like so many people do gay, straight, trans, and whatever."
"Idk the convoe before the interview so I can't say if asking about her dick was out of line."
"N U B I L E"
"So how do you tackle Slavoj Zizek's talk of when he purportedly befriended some black guys and allegedly  said to him 'yes you can call me ni**er and so on', in that instance he was critiquing political correctness as a repressive device, do you feel he was justified in that example whether it happened or not?"
"Youre pretty awesome...this Blair person, ohh boy. I dont even know where to start. Also, huzzah for the Freddie N word plug. Well played, dear  PS: im no bloody victim god damnit. Heroin was just too attractive..."

"'Us cis folks'"
"Bearings a bear and bears are naturally fat so is he just projecting his insecurites on other people? Also bear is a type of gay lol"
"Dear World,  so sorry for bearing  Love Australia"
"it's true there is a lot of vitriol from the anti-sjw side which is horrid. But if your identity is your transsexualism maybe you should not be surprised if stupid people ask about your sex life.  I hate the idea that I would have the right to dictate how you should interact with me (authoritarian to me), that's not a cart blanch for people to be assholes either. The egocentric idea that everyone should care about you is annoying as hell, if I can live my life on the edge of depression so could you."
"I can't help but think of the 'Cool Girl' monologue from Gone Girl when I hear 'cool trans'."
"i love how we just get so meta that I can make jokes about bone structure on your old videos"
"A note on 'privilege': I'm in a similar boat to Blair in that I began passing early in my transition, and at first I appreciated the more polite treatment (and even some of the cat-calls) because they were validating to my gender, but it's not real privilege. It's 75% wage for the same work, 10000 years of entrenched patriarchy, and having your body objectified and subjected to violence in exchange for getting a door opened for you. Yipee."
"And funny that you are kinda a spokesperson for us now, but i am glad for that change."
"I bet you hate her now too :)"
"No trans person should ever be physically assaulted -- not even by another trans person -- or randomly for being trans Even if you are a scientist who can prove there only two physical genders, with rare biological exceptions, and that most people's identity corresponds to their physical gender according to statistics  There is still no reason to assault someone (that scientist never said there was) Nor is there justification for being rude and passive-aggressive to people for being trans or any other reason Yet we all know people who can be rude and passive-aggressive, and that includes various forms of people on the gay/trans spectrum But there are serious problems with attempting to pass any specific LAW to outlaw rudeness, because it can be so subjective and because being passive-aggressive is by definition not aggressive and cloaked, and therefore a person who identifies as a victim of passive-aggressive behavior has to make a subjective determination that said behavior or pattern is in fact aggression of a 'fake-passive' nature and not an innocent mistake or other motivation, such as Lindsay Shepherd playing part of a TV documentary that was post-facto determined to be potentially insensitive to trans persons even though no trans persons in that classroom complained of 'feeling marginalized' and EVERYONE (god knows I did) feels marginalized at times, I just lacked a specific protected status for when I was a terrified pseudo-Aspbergers dweeb largely isolated from all my peers during school, terrified of saying something that would make me look stupid or weak. Passing a Law to clearly outlaw rudeness would be as difficult as trying to pass a Law such that a Board defines who can and cannot be defined as gay or otherwise determine their specific gender orientation.  Passing a Law to outlaw rudeness would result in applications based on an excessively wide net or excessively narrow net. Like if it was punishable to wrap a name in 6 parentheses to marks something or someone Jewish, how could it not be punishable for a Jewish person to wrap their own name in 6 parentheses?"
"Dear Sister, is that Dark Brotherhood reference? May the Night wrap you in her cold, loving embrace. *Welcome Home*"
"Crazy how your voice has changed Contra. Also, interesting that you have gain so many patreon supporters in such a short time. Surpassing ole Sargon by 1/3 In 1/2 the time! You’d think that in such a patriarchical, racist, bigoted country/world, the facists would be better funded than the righteous."
"I just found this channel today and binge-watched quite a few videos, but what got be subscribed is the dark brotherhood references!"
"omg the Nbomb page on errowid ;-DDDD"
"Nbome is so gross lol"
"I think Blaire is eventually going to regret being all buddy-buddy with shitheads like Bearing, particularly when the Youtube money dries up."
"It's funny watching these older videos where Contra is like, 'What me? Trans? No no no no no!'  On a slight tangent, since starting to watch these videos I've been considering re-creating my Freddie Mercury costume and posting it on Instagram, just to annoy those people who get bothered by gender bending. (I love playing Queen bingo when watching these videos). I wore it for a party with supposedly totally politically right on friends around 2001. I was surprised by how many people were really quite disturbed by it. My ex-boyfriend stood across the hallway from me for about ten minutes grinning inanely at me, then finally said, 'That's really. Fucking. Disturbing. The best thing about that costume is that I coudn't work out who you were for ages.' Mind you that is nothing to my shock on finding that  some people of similar political background to myself, (Anorcho eco activists), turn out to be raging TERFs. I don't think I ever really appreciated how difficult people find it to deal with when you don' t fit into the binary, even though it is something I have lived with all my life, not being considered a proper woman and all just because I have opinions, fail to remember to be not as good as men, and like playing football etc."
"Nah explain that inflating shit right now. Lmaoo"

"I love looking into the beautiful sanguine night sky"
"She doesn’t have “female privilege” per se, she has “attractive person privilege”. If she didn’t look the way she does and wasn’t cis passing she wouldn’t experience all this “privilege”. What people call “ female privilege” is really just the supposed benefits of benevolent sexism. But treating people like delicate flowers because you think they can’t take care of themselves or do things for themselves isn’t really privileging them...if anything, it’s condescending to them."
"I'm kinda late on this, but I'm going to go ahead and say that Blaire White has moved me to the left on trans issues. I've seen a few of your videos where you criticize Blaire and/or other conservative* trans activists for not challenging the preconceptions of anti-SJWs. However, for myself and a lot of other scummy shitposting assholes, having someone we agree with from an 'outgroup,' in this case from the trangender demographic, makes it far more natural and easy to empathize with OTHER transgender individuals.  The three biggest cracks (on this website, at least) so far that have helped break me out of a more conservative mindset have been, in this exact order: Bearing & others introducing me to Blaire White, the reconciliation and understanding between Sh0eOnHead and Milo Stewart, and your INDESCRIBABLY HIGH PRODUCTION QUALITY, JESUS COCKSUCKING CHRIST!  I might be representative of a lot of people, I might not. But I know that I've become a much more sympathetic individual towards all trans men and women because of the very people you parodied with that 'Tiffany Tumbles' video. I also know that a couple of my friends and a couple other people on YouTube have gone through similar ideological shifts for similar reasons.  You probably won't notice this comment, since it's on such an old video, but there is an entirely valid place in the transgender movement for people like Blaire. Without the 'cool' people helping to acclimate people like me, very few of us would ever get out of our ideological comfort zones."

"'This transgender don't not want safe spaces or any other special treatment or coddling.' Or an education either apparently."
"People like this bear dude only like a person of a marginalized group if they conform to his beliefs and what he sees as acceptable. Aka not complaining about ur own disenfranchisement and being self loathing about ur individuality in the majority white cis community."
"Haha, girl, you are a discovery. You totally wiped the floor with Blair in that debate from last year, and I'm only half way through it. You are coming to the dark side Contra, it's only a matter of time, you're much too intelligent and sane for the SJW bollocks."

"I'm at this odd point in my life where,most double down on the ideals they have upheld and have been taught. Personally,with the horrific vastness of the human population plus generational ideals. That I'm at the point of,everything I've held as a truth in my life is constantly in flux (I guess naturalism). So if the majority of people in this country veer towards socislism,I'm like wtf,whatever,let's try it. 1 person can asert they are 12 different species,like fuck,im a nobody,i don't know the the ultimate of existing. No one knows, so why should I listen too one side vs the other?.cuz mommy and daddy did?. Cuz America says it is?. Fuck that,my mind heart and soul isn't something a Nameless entity can take away from me.except in guantanimo bay,j8m crow...so on and do on."
"Suck it up buttercups"
"Society is in no way 'kinder' and 'more polite' to women lol"
"Honestly I have watched Blaire and I don't say this out of hate but the reason I think she's accepted in anti sjw  community. Is because she's right wing . and passing . I know sounds like bitchy but its true . Also she mocks some other trans people. Which okay"
"'I don't get to speak for trans people.'  Well now you do"
"Watching this from the future is a mind fuck."
"I think that if a person would like to chop his or her body part because it feels wrong... first they shouldn't and second they shouldn't use actual doctors to do it to not stimulate the market by giving insentive to mutilate people like with killing babies... industries of evil are built that way"
"in my book the coolest trans person(or people) are Miles McKenna and Laverne Cox"
"ContraPoints. You seem to be able to laugh at yourself and have a thick skin if you don't mind being called all those words you said at the end. You have made Bearing's point."

"You're cool"
"OMG when I was full time Transsexual 1985-2004 I was really treated Like a Woman! Even a woman at DMV in Arkansas, when I traded my California Female Driver License in to change to Man Driver License, I told her I had a sex change to a Man! She believed me, and asked 'Are you treated Better as a Man?' True Story!"

"Can please smo explain why contrapoints reffears to Anita like that 😂😂"
"Blair White is cool tho"
"this is kind of hilarious in retrospect"
"Okay... what's the deal with that shrine?"
"I unsubscribed from Blair after the whole Onision shitshow where he, of all people, kicked her ass pretty relentlessly. I genuinely liked her early videos where she was just speaking her thoughts, but now it seems like all her videos and Tweets are about right wing / conservative virtue signalling."
"Contrapoints: 'Us cis people'"
"I've been telling my friends to watch your channel. I am unsure what pronoun to use to describe you and because of that I feel like a jerk. What is the best pro-noun to describe you? I have opted to refer to you as 'they' instead of he or she because you are one or the other depending on when the video was made. I am confused and need help."
"Interesting how she thinks society being more welcoming to women is privilege, but unless there's a legal inequality then no kind of discrimination/oppression against other groups exists, and white privilege isn't real either."
"I just think it is interesting that a trans woman can confidently comment on how privileged women are in our society. Yes, I am sure they would have been just as thrilled about someone messing around in their genitals when they thought someone thought something is wrong with the way they think."
"I just wish the right would stop turning everything some people do into a problem. I mean, it's one thing if people don't go out of their way to be accepting of trans people. It's another thing to rant and rave and call people a secret Jewish conspiracy against the White Race just for talking about the fact that they don't want to get harassed.   Why can't the Right just sit down and shut up about the things they don't happen to agree with? I don't criticize anyone for being a pale heterosexual man. In fact, I often defend people like that. Just like I defend anyone. But somehow that puts me on the 'side' of the Jewish conspiracy to destroy the White Race. Why can't they just stop looking for the Jew behind the curtain and relax and live their lives without hatred and spite? I guess it makes them feel morally superior, or they get addicted to it."

"7:27 hahahaha"
"Is it wrong that I honestly kept looking @ Blaire's nose contour more than the fact that she looks female? _Shakes head_  .... ANYWAY, Idc how she looks bc in the end, she kinda sounds like an idiot. That's a bit more important to me than looks though. You know... Because she is put in the same category as me and all. YEAH! Awesome... Just what us women needed, another lady that giggles and doesn't care!  Btw... I have been watching your videos for HOURS now. You are intelligent, interesting. and hot... Very hot. You make me miss my cross dressing ex(totally not WHY he's my ex). You feed my  brain which I find super important and appreciate. So happy I found you!😍💋"

"If your point is that people only like those transwomen that don't act offended all the time or look presentable(I don't see a problem with this) somehow makes perception of those transwomen who aren't the above said things worse, then that is a natural of the choices that each transwoman on her own made. You might not like those transwomen that are conventionally beautiful or agrees with the other and might prefer transwomen who speak up for transrights, but sjws makes their oppression the core of their existence."
"I felt utterly baffled by White's comments throughtout the video. I watched this right after watching your video on being genderqueer...man. Is it my impression, or did she shoot a whole category of people she BELONGS to in the foot? One of the most underprivileged demographics in America, I might add. I haven't seen any of her videos but...still. What the Hell."

"I don’t see the point in trying to unionize this division. Abe Lincoln did when it was over slaves and it took a lot of blood and we still never really sorted it out a century later. I am kind of done with dealing with these fucks, they still haven’t come around for like a century. I think maybe we could use a two state solution here. No civil war just part ways. I am so tired of having to talk to people which I just want to choke after ten words, and I am sure they are sick of me too. Even though I am straight and white and male I cannot reach these twats. People keep imagining we can unite the left and right, but these assholes have always existed. We need to let them go be assholes in their own space and forge another for ourselves. Let us create Cuckistan and let them have the rest, and never think about them again."

"Hey Contra, Big video. As a former jordan peterson idiot fanboy, i was wondering if you had paid attention to his controversial opposition of bill c-51?  If yes.... what do you think of him and his take on trans rights? do you agree with his stance that making misgendering of someone punishable by law might create too strong of a social backlash, causing more discrimination? Or do you disagree with him, think that the new law will improve the general quality of trans lives?  Ive tried asking some sjws, but they respond with 'transphobe' and wont hear my debate, shut me down. So i understand if you do too, or just too busy to answer, but would love to hear your thoughts on this.  Anyway great content dude, keep it coming!!❤❤😘"

"Interesting.  I didn't realize Blaire spent all of five minutes being a decent human being. I guess the rush of being the darling of bigots went to her head real quick huh?"
"Applause!"
"ConTRAPoints"
"What a Douche ,putting feminism back years with her 'I like getting doors held open for me...'"
"This bear dude sounds as thick as Danny Dyer."
"Digging the Oblivion reference!"
"'I'm not trans and I don't know what it's like to be trans' LOL"
"yeah beautiful people get all the privilege"
"yeah it is quite annoying when people make inappropriate comments that you don't feel comfortable talking about"
"This channel is like a train wreck, don't wanna stare but I can't look away :("
"NEWS FLASH SWEETIE YOU'RE HELLA GENDERQUEER AND GORGEOUS"
"Is it just me or does Blaire overexpose her videos a _shitton_? Sometimes trans people will do it to 'smooth' things a bit to look more feminine, but it often just looks like the video or photo was badly set up. I just avoid all that by not taking any footage of myself, ever. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
"I'm binge watching your library while playing eternal. I am now wondering if I took my medication. I am now taking my medication. I am now a bag of pork rinds."
"People don't open doors for men? People don't smile at men? What is she talking about?"
"You are so rad, lovely human person :) I have been bingewatching your videos. I've had a lot of questions about this sort of thing and I've tried to ask them to my genderqueer and trans friends, but they are so used to being mistreated that they expect my questions on gender to become crossexamining and doubting their identities. I stopped asking, but your videos are thoughtful and smart (as are you) and they've answered my questions really well. You're beautiful, inside and out, and I wish you well."
"If Blaire wasn't good-looking, cis-passing, didn't have access to treatment or couldn't afford to transition, etc. she wouldn't be saying this stuff. She appears to be incapable of putting herself in someone else's shoes. Who cares about those who don't magically turn into a copy of her overnight? Of course it's our responsibility to not anger people with our obvious transness. They don't have to treat us fairly. We should keep quiet and take what we get. If they're not assaulting or murdering us at this second we have nothing to complain about. No, fuck that!"
"I love how Blaire manipulates her viewers good for her tbh"
"It's hard to not like Blaire, she's a sassy and catty girl with a heart of gold. ;P But she does and says some stupid shit sometimes. And I found your channel through her!"
"I think you're my favorite youtuber right"
"as a trans person I hated it when all of my friends would call me 'it' when i came out to them."
"Bearing is unfunny trash"
"You have a cool brain"
"7:36- That was Dr. Frank n furter."
"After watching all of your videos, I've noticed recurring cuts that remind me of redlettermedia's plinkett reviews. It's great."
"Well some people are cool and some are not  Not everyone can be cool"
"The Anita shrine kills me every time"
"'I'm not trans and I don't know what it's like to be trans' ...this is hilariously ironic in retrospect"
"Love Bearing and Blaire!"
"i can't believe he appropriated the bear from total drama island"
"i mean im a cis woman but unless i go thru the motions of applying makeup/dressing nice people generally look right through me. the idea that 'people are just nicer to women' is true is literally only a thing a hot person thinks, what a moron."
"The Blaire White double bind against transgenders: Being both against youth transition and makes fun of people for not passing."
"You should try and get away from the victim mentality aswell. If you want to be accepted = act normal. There's nothing wrong with being yourself while also having a gender-crysis mental-illness - just don't expect people to accept it as 'normal'  It's not.  AND please understand - there is nothing wrong with being ill as long as you understand and admit it.  Just don't try to force the majority of the planet to change their way of thinking about this, just because a small minority might get offended... boohoo"
"ContraPoints, where do you get those wonderful leather wear?"
"These days, you can't be reasonably offended, your automatically an hypersensitiveliberaltumblecucksnowflake"
"I think it's worth noting that the type of cis female privilege that Blaire describes only applies to certain contexts.  When I go to work with a bunch of software engineers at a male-dominated company where every single person besides the executive assistant is a male except for me, I sure as hell do not get any smiles or doors opened or special treatment.  In fact, people tend to treat me like an idiot until they know I am capable of tackling complicated problems."
"'Fighting for fair treatment is not the same as having a victim mentality.'  -ContraPoints"
"lov this, thank u for broaching this topic like it needed to be broached"
"AYY EROWID"
"'I'm not trans'"
"you're a privileged woman if you're beautiful, straight, and live a submissive role. I don't think she knows what it's like to be a privileged male because she was 'gay' (appeared as though) so therefore wasn't in the exclusive club."
"7:38 .... barfs"
"'You guys are cool. But only if you play by my rules.'  Exactly how are you any different?"
"D A R K  M O T H E R"
"you are being way to nice to Blaire"
"Agreed."
"Blare White should have been born black."
"I actually picture Bearing as a bear."
"I love all your red letter media plinket references. Subtle and great"
"I can't find the reflexology vid from the beginning."
"I love Kevin MacLeod"
"As a largely pre-anything permanent transguy who really does not get seen as a man by the vast majority of people around him, I just find it odd that she seems to be one of the few people who feels like what she is experiencing (the coddling and infantilization of women) is privilege. You can easily find dozens of other transwomen discussing how that they simply lost privileges now that they are viewed by the general public as if they were cisgender women. They are taken less seriously in social context, coddled, more likely to be publicly sexually harassed, paid less, among other things. While, in contrast, transmen discuss being taken more seriously, treated as though they are more knowledgeable (despite the same level of knowledge), paid more, etc. I suppose, being white and being a person with a lot of luck when it comes to passing, she just is denying the oppression that others experience, which is really sad to see. You can also see that Bearing is simply using her as a tool, while she just giggles in response to being used as a 'token trans person' to justify whatever crap he wants to say/ask and that's kind of sad."
"Damn, he's cute"
"So you made a video saying Hey don't tell trans-kids to drink poison' and Persephone says they shouldn't get upset over comments and videos while being upset over a video..... Also teenagers are more likely to  take stupid shit  too seriously and isn't the likelihood of suicidal tendencies high in trans people   so wouldn't a trans teenage have a extreme levels of suicidal tendencies....... yeah but they should grow up not the assholes telling them to drink poison ."
"One thing I can say is...it's refreshing to see someone who knows the difference between trans and genderqueer"
"Female privilege still isn't real tho"
"ok but what kind of a person asks a trans woman if she tucks her penis between her thighs? like, maybe if they were friends and he was making an edgy joke, but this is literally somebody he's talking to for (most likely) the first time, in a video he's going to post online, and he goes that route? all I can say is, wow."
"4:18 didn't Blaire say she was sexually assaulted when she was 18?"
"Sounds a bit like a strawman to me. Bearing's video is called the 'coolest' trans chick on youtube not 'the only cool' trans chick. So you're point with 'if you don't look like that, you're not cool' isn't very honest.  I have to admit I hardly understand the fuss about this 'issue'. I don't care how you identify but I don't get the need for all this political correctness. Probably sounds mean but how many people are affected by this? Is it even 1% of the population? Of course no one should be discriminated against or be assaulted by others but that goes for everyone."
"WE KNOW."
"Great video :) I like Blaire. I don't always agree with her but I enjoy some of her content."
"I like you and I like Blaire!"
"you get to be called cool if you dont make them question their actions by acting like the struggle is already over. also by not being offended by any of their off color comments because not being offended is strength but how DARE you call me a racist"
"maybe you don't need to get all your information from the internet and make some actual trans friends then you would understand them better. not polls not surveys but actual real live fucking people!"
"0:51 Chairman mao, the great man of the history."
"Hahahhahhah, do you know what that line of Chinese on the photo frame actually means??????? It means 'Chairman Mao, the great man of the history'."
"Jesus you like misunderstanding things. Old video, but God."
"'She also told me to get fucked in the urethra with a blowtorch. I guess I don't have all the answers.'"
"I just notice the text on the frame you are using for Anita. :)"
"Even tho that I like blaire. I still liked the video."
"i-i-what???"
"The only reason I would walk into a male bathroom (when I am female) is if I am BUSTING for a pee and the line for the female bathroom is daunting. Then out of sheer desperation I will use the male loos. BUT under the new bathroom laws mean I could justify my entrance into a male bathroom as a female by saying that on that days, I identify as male. Men would not like a female to wander in when they are peeing or their kids are peeing at the stalls.  Similarly no woman is going to welcome a man with a dick entering into a female bathroom when a woman is in the bathroom with their girls."
"Ya lost the debate"
"Your boring"
"Ah Blaire White. Our very own Uncle Tom. Every group has one!"
"So basically to him, it's only ok to be a trans.. as long as your conservative"
"damnit i thought this was gonna tell me how to be cool"
"Blair is a piece of shit in my opinion. She is just an islamophobic self centered douche. She doesnt rely on research but think her opinions are the only fact."
"I think the 'cool-because-you-can-joke-about-what-makes-you-different' thing isn't necessarily a bad thing. I do agree on most points, but everyone has something that they are more likely to be sensitive about, something that is generally not joked about, but if you're someone who is comfortable with joking about it, why is it so wrong to be perceived as 'cool.' People see self depreciation or comfortability with possibly sensitive issues as strength. Obviously no one should be expected to roll with the punches, but why is it so wrong to see someone who can and does as 'cool.'"
"The only bits I wasnt there with you on were beautifully corrected in your latest one about genderqueer, you rock!!"
"omgggggg youre fucking hilarious hahahaha"
"wtf is that lady on that shrine?  Is that really his mother?  If anything Contrapoint really hit his point to be creepy.  Wtf! is my proper reaction."
"*attack peoples character*  lovely way to muddy the waters."
"You look like Dan Avidan."
"Why are they so 'cool'? Well, because cultural-marxist jew run media and academia constantly tell weak minded individuals how 'cool' they are and they just parrot the propaganda. Liberalism is mental illness."
"You are now my favorite fat manjina Contra.  Also I loved your work in Iran."
"Blaire is the coolest,most intelligent, hottest  etc. etc."
"Blaire laughs at offensive jokes because they're jokes. You must be fun at parties."
"Hmmm not being a dick to trans when they have what I'm guessing is a higher suicide rate like gays and lesbians? What about bullied teens they should just toughen up? Sounds a pretty dick comment from that's trans IMO."
"I agree with you, but you shouldn't call her a him."
"Have you seen this article (http://www.weeklystandard.com/anti-anti-anti-trump/article/2007037) describing the cowardly breed of establishment republicans known as 'anti-anti Trumpists' ? While not actively supporting Trump themselves, these guys reserve all ire and criticism for the awful libs who make opposing trump their pet cause.   Contra, what you are is an anti-anti SJW. I've never felt like a label summed up my own *identity* so well!"
"So she's cool because she's hot and disregards the problems that less hot people face in public?"
"Everybody's like that"
"you should stop spending money on those goofyass costumes"
"You make some *really* good points.  Trans people are only 'cool' when they're attractive enough to cis het white dudes to be fuckable and don't complain about the way they're treated by society.  It's a struggle but you gotta do what makes you happy and lets you be the authentic you."
"It's cause she's hot. I never even knew she was trans. We are a very shallow species."
"It's obvious. Blair hasn't grown up as woman and has had male privilage most of her life. Now she's a ''woman'' who speaks against feminism and all men worship her. Little do they know is that it's mainly men who aree with her and that most women would probably kindly ask for her to revoke her female card."
"I love you. So glad I found your channel."
"God forbid you want to be acknowledged equally under the eye of the law."
"Need this guy or Hbomberguy on Drunken peasants"
"The logic of 'Bigger issue exists, so throw away all the smaller issues' is so short-sighted. The trans person angry at you seems clouded by anger and wants big change- NOW! That's great and all but don't accept all the little favors and tributes along the way to 100% acceptance. People want to help and attitudes like that (while possibly justified) just hurt everyone in the end. It sucks that they have to sit in the spotlight in this time period but it's for a good cause. It's rough but there's no other way sadly. Anything else would be rejecting reality."
"You are a jealous raging shitbag."
"I don't think that you standing up for us transpeople implies that we can't take an insult. Imo we need all the help we can get because there are a lot of issues that need to be highlighted and fixed all over the world regarding trans rights. But it is probably pretty clear that the trans comunity is sometimes a bit split. Probably because of TERFs and the somewhat common feeling amongst transpeople that they are the overlookes LGBT letter. So a lot of transpeople probably feel a bit alone in their fight. I know I certainly do some times. It does feel like that I'm almost always the only one in a thread arguing for trans rights and against the normal ideas about gender. It can makr you a bit cynical about the rest of the left since it some times feels like your issues are ignored in favor of other things which may be hotter right now."
"I felt it appropriate to separate my praise for you and this video generally from a grievance I have with a specific facet therein.  Around the halfway mark, you separate yourself from transfemmes and refer to yourself, to paraphrase, as 'just another crossdressing pervert of the kind who probably shouldn't be in women's bathrooms.' Your cognizance of your seperate-ness from trans people and your position hence as an ally is appreciated and, sadly, quite rare.  However, during this segment you use a few clips, one of which is from the rocky horror picture show.  I would like to point out that this character is, in fact, considered a transmisogynist caricature by many, including myself, and Frank N. Furter's appearance in this segment tinges a lighthearted joke with some quite unfortunate implications as a consequence.  My position on this is further supported by the fact that the character's creator has, despite being nonbinary himself, overtly stated that trans women aren't real women. (source: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/03/08/rocky-horror-star-richard-obrien-trans-women-cant-be-women/amp/?client=ms-android-huawei)  To quote someone else who relays experiences I myself share almost to a T (pun intended):  'Dr. Frank-N-Furter is not an example of positive queer representation. He is a ton of shitty, old-fashioned queer exploitation stereotypes mashed into a single character. He’s a vampy, cruel, selfish, abusive, violent murderer and rapist. Y’all, he rapes people and keeps sex slaves. Not a role model.  I understand that RHPS was integral to the coming-out stories of a lot of my queer friends, even some trans ones. I realize that some people, decades ago, looked at Frank and saw a brave, unapologetic gender-nonconforming person with brazenly displayed sexuality, and they said, “Hey, I can do that?”  That’s not what young-me saw when I looked at Frank and characters like him. I saw a cruel, unapologetic gender-nonconforming person, grossly over-sexualized and inconsiderate to others, and I said, “I can’t try to be a woman – people will think I’m him.” [I'd like to add that this particular paragraph hit home exceptionally hard for me. I was rarely exposed to transness as a kid/adolescent, and the only three times I'd seen transness depicted were in two horrendous family guy jokes and RHPS. All of these experiences pushed me further back into the closet and exacerbated my self esteem and identity issues for the precise reason mentioned here.]  Characters like Frank set the tone for queer characters in media for decades, as well as the conflation of transgender/transsexual women and transvestite men. To this day, transgender women like me are thought of as inherently sexually aggressive, our gender identity based in fetishism.'  (source: https://www.google.co.uk/amp/www.themarysue.com/lets-not-do-the-time-warp/amp/?client=ms-android-huawei)  Edit: this comment is less relevant now your video regarding your own genderqueerness has come out, and your acknowledgement of the problems I mentioned. I appreciate you and everything you do so much 💝"
"People like Blaire- gatekeepers and respectability-politics-touting lateral violence perpetrators- are generally known as 'truscum'. They tend to be among the cosiest with reactionaries in this way.  I've heard overt violence against nonbinary people specifically termed 'exosexism'- although my knowledge of the term's origins is purely anecdotal.  What Blair says also has a profoundly destructive impact on transfemmes and nonbinary amab folk who do 'pass', however. All trans people are subject to transphobia, but amab trans people are subject to transmisogyny as well. Blair's statements victim blame and gaslight the horrors that many dmab people who do in fact 'pass' face, and essentially amount to 'if you're victimised in any way it's because you're not a good t***ny and you just need to git gud at this whole gender thing.'   Communities have a depressing habit of violently striving to throw their least 'respectable' members- trauma victims, loud controversial activist types, people with mental illnesses and physical+mental disabilities, people for whom the community's oppression intersects with other oppressions- under the bus.  It's important to call this kind of behavior out and advocate for those of us in the community who don't often get that kind of respect. I love your content, appreciate an actually respectful look at who we are, and love the balance and civility you bring to a discussion fraught with the precise opposite. Also you're a hottie, and that doesn't hurt matters. <3"
"The coolest trans/gay/black/etc. people are the ones that least challenge my preconceived notions of those marginalized groups."
"Bearing has NPD.  What do you expect from a damaged mind like that?"
"I stopped watching when you assumed that Bearing is automatically transphobic because he leans right. Seriously and progressives call US closed-minded?"
"I couldn't subscribe to this channel because I don't think I could bear to be a part of this weird giant argument the Internet is having with itself but I still want to say that only watching this video you strike me even-handed, self deprecating and insightful. I agree with most everything you think anyway so maybe that's just bias, but I find the genuine humour and lightness of your tone on tough subjects inspiring. I'm sure your schtick is super confronting to some people but i appreciate that you have your guns and you stick to them without be reductive or exclusive.    Good job I guess."
"Well as another fellow slightly crossdressing leaning person who is gay,  I can say that Blaire is a fresh breath of air because she doesn't use  trangederism as some sort of crutch. She can be reasonable and she  doesn't get easily offended. Even if she wasn't conventionally pretty, I  still would listen to what she had to say.   The problem with a lot of trans people is how they revel in Victim-hood and that is what turns of people when they see it on a daily basis or in the case of Youtube, see it on constant video after video which is eyebrow raising because you'd think they'd be one of the first people (along with us gays) to develop that thick skin in a world that may not be the most accepting.   But I can say that other than the  occasional rude commenters, a lot of people have become a little more open to trans people and will give them a listen if they can explain themselves in a well-thought out manner instead of raging angriness.   However, most people are going to be against transtrenders like Milo Stewart or Riley Dennis and there's no getting around that. Heck, it's no surprise trans people like Blaire despise them with their insistence of 100+ genders and don't forget Milo Stewart's infamous quote of 'all white people racist, all men are misogynistic, all 'cis' people are transphobic'. When you start off with something like that, you shouldn't be surprised when people don't want to listen to anything you have to say (not that it would help because a lot of what she says is just... Dumb but I digress).  And the other fact of the matter about the whole 'passing privilege'. I do understand that hormones and surgery do cost a crap ton of money but what with makeup tricks these days, it's a lot easier to go half way and paint your face to look more of the gender you identify with (both for women and men). Saying that, I know there is someone out there who's going to tell me that not all women are feminine appearing and not all men are masculine appearing, I get that. I really do (I'm a feminine appearing guy).  But my point is that if you're a transwoman who doesn't make any effort to look remotely feminine, you shouldn't complain if a few women are freaked out of you going into the women's restroom. I don't hear as much backlash from men like I do with women but I think it's because a lot of transmen do put in a little effort to look at the most, boyish. But my point is, if you're a transwoman with a beard and just look like like a feminine guy, it's better to use the mens restroom because it'll be less of a hassle instead of potentially making a scene in a women's restroom.  Anyway, it was certainly interesting to hear the other side, you brought up some good points and I agree with a few but I still feel the way I do about Transtrender people who are playing make believe with their 100+ genders and sexualities."
"feminist scenes i've seen (in scandinavia) are pissed and keep relevant the fact that male victims are mocked. so sad the thing blaire said"
"This video. This channel. Is gold. Keep it up."
"4:13 over and over"
"You have me dying with the alter to Anita😂 Fucking brilliant!😂"
"A trans person is a trans person. they don't change gender. It is as simple as that. Should trans people be treated as shit? No, but why get offended? The Joker from the Dark Knight resonated with a lot of people and part of that was because of that line... you know that line right? 'Why so serious!?' And that is basically what we have here. People take offense. Why take offense? If you can take heckling then you aren't falling to the mass ridicule but if you make a big deal about it then you are just being autistic.  Just look at yourself in the mirror. You look like a guy and you are a guy.  If people tell yo to your face that you look like a man, would you take offense? Does the truth offend you? In the case of the example I just posed you likely not... but then what if you did? Taking offense at being told the truth and then going on about how much of a victim you were because of this...  That should explain it.  Basically, if you aren't acting like a piece of crap... then that is cool."
"As a fan of Blaire, I think you made some good points (and some bad ones). Subbed."
"What about Turd Flinging Monkey's interview of Iron Liz who is a transwoman who is significantly more masculine-looking than blaire White?"
"You strike me as one of the most reasonable feminist content creators, but you'r interpretation of people's words and actions often seems intentionally dishonest, and I think it lowers the overall quality of your content."
"What is the deepest voice you can do? Very classy."
"First all I don't know that Blaire was a Trans I don't really watch her videos. But saying well I don't get discriminated bc trans to me she got lucky bc to most people she just looks a beautiful woman. Her voice is a little but there are women who have deep voices."
"Your content is awesome"
"GodDAMMIT Bearing, you are bringing shame to Australia. I expect shitty 'alt-right' MRA/anti-feminist stuff from Americans and to a lesser extent Brits, but when I hear the ol' 'oi mate' accent I go 'NOT AN AUSTRALIAN'. I bet a Bunnings sausage sizzle Bearing is from Queensland. I live in Queensland. I hate living in Queensland."
"Great video, that Persephone chick is trash."
"You know, Contra, you're not half bad.  I don't agree with a lot of your stuff, but you at least present yourself rationally and unconfrontationally enough that I don't mind hearing the other side of the argument.  Let's see how long until you fuck that up by talking trash about furries. X3"
"why do you cross dress?"
"it's almost like Blaire and Bearing are friends... and that he knew she'd be okay with being asked those questions.... hmmmm"
"Yep. It's pretty difficult to avoid pissing someone off these days.  To sidestep the pronoun minefield, I just address everyone as 'puny human'. Sadly, nobody invites me to their birthday parties anymore."
"The red letter media inspiration is strong."
"You're bits about Anita always crack me up.."
"Blaire White exemplifies one of the vilest, most fucked up and most harmful mentalities known to humankind: 'fuck you, got mine'. That's all."
"'don't call human beings 'it'' As a non-English native, the fact that English use the term 'It' for animals sounds rather strange. In most languages I'm aware of you it would be or grammatically incorrect or just rude. I don't like to say 'See that dog? I thing it's hungry.' I'll just say he or she. Anyway it's a pretty out of topic comment but fuck it."
"I pass pretty well, but non-passing trans people are super cool and valid."
"Contra, you are much better at doing makeup than I am."
"Blaire White has some serious Stockholm syndrome to hang out with a dude like Bearing. She makes me depressed."
"Really glad I found your channel, your videos are really well-done, thanks for making them! And yeah no one can speak for all trans women; not that Blaire person, not myself, not anyone. Our opinions are as diverse as any group's, yet people keep thinking we're some kind of hive-mind. Ok fine they might have a point with the hive-mind thing, but we all still have our own individual opinions and personality within the Trans Hive Mind."
"Can one person really be a spokesperson for an entire group of people? We all have different lives, experiences and viewpoints. And while there is a difference between the perspective of an in-group person versus an out-group person, and there's something to be said for that, nobody can represent everybody. Just let people represent themselves."
"Back in the day, women weren't offended by the fact they didn't have the right to vote. While there are definitely times, being offended isn't necessary, I'd never praise anyone for never being offended at all."
"Blaire White is the definition of an 'Uncle Tom', but in the trans community. I've taken to calling trans women like her 'Aunt Blaire's'."
"25-i lol watch out that shit is sketch"
"You are so disingenuous! You decided to leave out where Bearing specifically ASKED Blaire if it was OK for him to asking those questions; and if she felt ANY question was out of bounds to feel free to tell him to fuck off!  Do you feel the least bit ashamed for blatantly lying about that? What an odd concept! Showing respect and asking permission."
"That's life, get the fuck over it."
"Dude, wtf, when did you become this cool? Loving these vids.=8)-DX"
"there is ContraNOPOINT to this discussion. bearing stated that Blaire is one of the more popular trans woman in this community, can't you let him have his fucking opinion without taking shit to heart?  People like Bearing, Blaire White, Undoomed, Amazing Atheist aka TJ, ect. are people who criticize others on ideas while also making it comedic for the audience hence why they're more popular. do they mean some of the shit they say? probably not. I don't think bearing thinks every feminist is a slut or cunt and I don't believe undoomed thinks everyone he makes of video on is a moron but they due it for comedy.  TLDR Learn comedy before you critic it."
"Great and informative video. And... dear gods are you hot :)"
"BE PASSING OR BE LAME  what the actual fuck blaire white."
"lol bearing is 100% cringe. makes no actual arguments for his position. the only YouTuber worse than him is undoomed."
"I like using the word 'tranny' I think it's cute and a funny little word. Do as see all transgender people as tranny? No. Why? Because like I said, tranny to me makes me think cute and funny and if I don't personally perceive a transgender person as at least cute, I'd rather just ignore them and move on with my life. Maybe people should listen more to what other people are saying instead of listening to just buzz words and acting like victims. I have a tranny fetish and I personally think Blaire is a hot little tranny."
"Wow, what an incredibly ignorant statement about how non trans people cared more about the bathroom problem. It was a huge fucking issue in that community. And the trans community were the first people to protest the problem. TYT's jordan chariton covered it."
"I like how you use self-aware campy humor to talk about serious topics. That's an approach I strive for with my work."
"of course the individuals in question have a rapport; in that context the questions really aren't rude. but what happens when people expect total strangers to field such questions, and when they respond with some form of 'mind your own business,' are then raised by hordes of trump hair pepes and anime avatar nazis as yet another triggered SJW?  moral panic about how safe spaces are a bigger threat to free speech than the bluepigs that kick the shit out of (actual) dissidents."
"so not telling someone to kill themselves is apparently 'being coddled' according to persephone sixty-six? like being respected and treaded as a human being with feelings is the same as coddling, wow"
"Yes, not getting offended by silly things is cool."
"Jesus christ, Bearing is such a bogan..."
"Firstly I'll admit I'm one of the anti-feminists. I think you've put a good video together here. I also think you have the potential to put out alot of good content if you stay legit with your points.   I do want to add one thing. The questions he asked I get can be really uncomfortable but a lot of ppl are genuinely interested in the answers and from a genuine curiosity. I guess the best way to try and explain it is when ppl ask male paraplegics if they can have sex... if that makes sense?"
"The message that bearing and Blair White are giving is pretty clear: Being different is fine and 'cool' if you leave your identity at the door."
"Keep up the good work."
"This was a good video - I like that you pointed out the positive things that Blaire has said - giving balance and counterpoint  to your criticism. The humor was very heavy handed (Worshiping at the Shrine of Anita!) - but I still smiled. 8-)"
"Weak"
"You misinterpret this. Most people in feminist or in these circles disgust me. I don't like the movement and for myself personally I wish it changed a large degree. The right disgust me too. But I don't want to be treated as some nimble eggshell. I want free and clear and no question too unaskable. And no conversation too untalkable. Everything is on the table. Thats...why Blarie is cool. Because really does that come from this particular sect of people."
"Bathroom rights are not meaningless to me and there not meaningless to other trans people. I have been harassed in bathrooms before by security staff on two Separate occasions both of which happened after the bill passed. (I fought hard for the fairness for all Marylanders act.) Nowadays most people think I'm pretty cute but there are still people who can clock the most beautiful trans people ever and try to get them thrown out of places so these bills do help. I could be mistaken on this so please correct me if I am wrong. I would guess that bearing sees Blaire as a variety of man an not a variety of woman based on other videos of his. I would also imagine if that was the case he would vote against a bathroom protection bill in Australia, and that he would do that even if he knew that Blaire was sharing an apartment with him. You can call me a SJW baby for saying this but this is unsurprising hypocrisy. And when somebody says to me something like ' I got no problem with you as a dude just don't ever use the women's restroom.' I don't consider them worthy of my friendship.  Respectfully  Angie"
"I'm fairly sure that critiquing a stream between two anti-sjw YouTubers, for whom you admit not to caring, falls into the same category of slightly obsessive and petty shaming about which anti-sjw YouTubers tend to make videos (and for which you criticise them). It's kind of ironic. Of all your videos, this is the one I dislike. It's still very funny though; I'll give you that. You usually discuss interesting points of view which are counter to the YouTube community's beliefs (channel name and all that) and which challenge my own beliefs. This video is just a bit snooty and trivial."
"I forgot. Every Trans-person should be worried about feminism, the what I found out is called 'white feminism' (or how I used to recognize them as WOMYN), dont want you. Gloria Steinam was repulsed by a tennis player named Rene Richards was transitioning in the 70's. It wasnt until the early 2000s she came out publically saying she changed her veiw. I did not come up with White Feminism, it was explained in a video made by feminists. Doing more research, I found that Trans women were excluded from a womyn for womyn music festival. Stating only real women can preform."
"Wow, I like that you do the same type of videos, but you are strange. And the cross dressing SM is a pretty normal thing to see in my world.' Nothings Shocking.' Blaire tends to know how to take a joke, especially from assholes. I have been the 'passing' (which is a term I hate. I appear straight, so everyone just assumes) gay guy my whole life, Im 43. I have done more for my community by living outside my bubble and changing minds the whole time. When people ask you dumb questions, tell them the clinical truth in as funny as you can. It shuts them up. And when Bearing asks Blaire that stuff, its like Howard Stern and that guy has done a ton of good for every minority in an uncoventional way. You have to fight their jokes, with your own jokes. Not some trippy wanna be shocking stuff."
"You look a lot like Razorfist. I love it.  Good channel."
"psychadelics, eh. That explains quite a lot."
"It's funny how these big YouTubers can no longer take real criticism. They're like, 'everyone loves me now and you're totally ruining it!'"
"50 points for Dark Brotherhood reference."
"The hate you get from the anti-sjw audience is weird imo, as you always seem to criticize both sides of the arguments in all your vids. Well, I subscribed, looking forward to more content"
"I think the purpose of blaire's videos is more about the people who say women are oppressed and men benefit from that oppression.  She was a man and now she's a convincing looking women who usually gets treated like a cis woman.  And she doesn't perceive any oppression because of because of being a woman that she didn't receive as a man.  It's honestly a different story for trans people who are transitioning or have incompatible bone structures etc.  but at least to me what stands out about her is her perspective on the modern feminist idea that men benefit from the oppression of men.  She experiences privileges she didn't receive as a man and that just goes to show that women aren't oppressed; men and women simple have different but not unequal experience."
"Nice oblivion reference ;)"
"@2:10  Does it really come as any surprise that she would 'jump on the feminism is cancer bandwagon' after making a video about how she witnessed first hand just how cancerous it is?  That it is such displays of cancerous behavior that lead to the conclusion that it is cancerous?"
"+ContraPoints did you seriously show a clip from Rocky Horror Picture Show and say Rocky Balboa? First of all, not even close. And second of all,  the character you pictured wasnt the one in that film named Rocky. Goodness Gracious"
"SO GOOD"
"I think this guy failed to understand how people communicate in real life. Sure, in everyday life you shouldn't go up to transgender people and ask 'how ling did it take to grow your titties?' But when your conversing with familiar people and friends your going to speak differently around them than you would a total stranger."
"00:54 subscribed"
"around 2:00  It's almost as if intersectionality is a real thing, and it isn't just a strict man/woman paradigm of oppression. Who'd a thunk it, aside from all those pesky third wave feminists everyone hates?"
"Well obviously she does not care about her junk. That's why she comes off  as a libertarian. Please just stop"
"I've been watching you for years and for the first time ever I'm offended that more people didn't love this video more. That was excellent. How safe would that trans woman feel in a mens bathroom?"
"Ya know, i find you disagreeable in some respects, but ill be damned you have a fantastic sense of humor. Good on ya"
"The human mind is a democracy, many differen't voices and viewpoints are within people, probably every type of person. The person decides which thoughts to validate and which to reject. If you go guilt fishing you will find bad things because of that. Tormenting people over thoughts makes you evil scum."
"10/10 Oblivion ref."
"I seriously don't know if you are for real or not, has the internet made me so jaded so that I just can't tell anymore?"
"Strawmans, Everywhere."
"grasping at straws?"
"Are you really an SJW or just a supreme shitlord these days? Gonna delete all your vids again at some point?"
"You forgot to include the fact that bearing said that if she felt that his questions were inappropriate to tell him off and not answer. He is an irreverent fuck to everyone so stop trying to make it look like he singles out trans people. That interaction was not in anyway like the scenario you painted especially since they both knew about each other and what they were like.  Also, being nice and polite to everyone is overrated.. If I don't like you then I am not going to pretend like I am."
"Voice of reason. Definitely a much needed voice in a conversation that's too noisy at the edges. It's as if people are not interested in even trying to understand the others position. I mean what do anti SJWs have to lose. Just their seat in the thrown I guess.  Good to have you back Nick."
"Keep making videos, Nyk. I'm an old subscriber from the 'Golden Age'. Your perspective is needed in what seems to have become an echo chamber."
"You do point to something interesting there, she is seen as a cool trans chick. Why? Is it because she is really cute? Or is it because of her videos?  She does seems to have an open mind and cool attitude. But, is that and her looks related?"
"SJW and trans are two distinctly different issues you moron. I will guarantee that if you asked any of these shitlords you mentioned in your previous video  if being trans is wrong they would say that being trans isn't wrong."
"Nick,  I know that you have great criticisms to give to youtubers like bearing, but I think you should honestly have a conversation WITH them.  I'm not saying they're right about everything, but I think you're one of the few people who can disagree with them without creating terrible drama.  I think you acknowledge the problems with SWJs, and I think that you're reasonable enough to even see why there are reactionary social media movements to the SJWs. I know that people like Sargon don't *want* to be reactionary, but they are.  Sargon has even said these things. That he's been doing what he does for so long that he's unable to find any merits to the SJW mentality. People like Bearing and Sargon are certainly abrasive, but I think there is a logic to what they are trying to do ABOVE just merely trying to bully and offend.  Do they bully? Possibly (maybe even probably), but I don't think they're bullying out of spite. I genuinely don't think they mean people harm, and I think they are trying to address ideas. (Lets not forget how intense someone like Isaac Newton could get in an argument. Many arguments with Socrates became quite personal, I'm recollecting Socrates' encounter with Callicles...) I think you can see that.   Since most people who hold your views cant see that they're not intentionally malicious, you are in a particularly unique situation where they might actually be willing to actually listen to your criticisms.  I don't expect that you are planning on doing this, but please don't stop the dialogue with these guys. I think you can add a much needed perspective to what they are saying."
"Pointless video that is saying 'i dont know' ... well then fuck off"
"ah the silly arguments again Blaire is great as being relaxed that's why her videos are popular she talks not rants like Milo she talks and is charming and funny unlike many shouting YouTube twats, and the unwanted attention I'm fat I'm on weight watches so I can be slim and not so am I betraying other fatties this argument is ridiculous especially from people who don't recognise God the tribalism in SJW philosophy is really Ironic it's basically based on the sin concept from catholicism that is also used by racist black people with the odious line about the Sins of the Father to go to the children so if my grandad was racist there for the burden is on my shoulders well my answer to that is the same as I gave a religious person a week ago, FUCK You with your guilt trip I'm not responsible for other people."
"I made a video response to this."
"I really don't have a problem with transgender people as long as they recognize that they are in fact, people of a specific sex that want to dress up like a specific gender category of a specific historical era.  It reminds me of the joking tidbit about gay marriage; that homosexual people should also be allowed to have a mortgage, marital infidelity, and a 50% + divorce rate just like heterosexual people :^)"
"[4:46 - 5:46] That is because bearing and blaire know each other well enough to make these jokes.What is wrong with the point that you are making is that you assume that if two people who get along rib each other it must be okay to say the same thing to complete strangers [5:34-5:47].   'Since it would be rude to ask a cis person a question about their genitals' [5:17 - 5:28]- not if they know each other well enough. Here are some friends ribbing another friend about his genitals  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yCrBE1SxMg]."
"You inaccurately represent Bearing and all the other 'shitlord' content producers, yet again.  I watch all of the 'shitlord' content producers you target for the underlying message: No one should be concerned with anyone's feelings about an issue, only the facts.   Example: Bearing is not fat-shaming. He is simply pointing out the obvious; being obese is not healthy. He criticizes, rightfully, those that attempt to undermine via acceptance the unhealthiness of being obese. If those people did not attempt to make obesity normal, there would be no Bearing video."
"nbomes suck man, get some 1p"
"why do I have the feeling you're yet another white male feminist who thinks he can bully people edit btw armoured sent me"
"Wow I'm pretty sure i was subbed to you like 8 years ago.  You have changed."
"2:45   You either pass or you don't. We have a lot more problems, if the law is the other way around.  3:50    The main part is that she is not a SJW. I generally dislike the type of trans people, which call me transphobic...  4:40   There are still trans issues, but SJWs are not the answer. SJWs tend to destroy relations between 'normal' and 'minority'. This thing can be compared to BLM tbh.  4:55   Friendly chat =/ rude  6:15  Trans people are 'Cool', unless they are SJW. You can obviously still point out trans issues, unless you do it in the SJW way.  8:10   No, one should treat trans people like everybody else."
"Hello, I have left my supposed 'safe-space' to come here and say a majority of points you brought up are flat out strawmen and rather shittily put together.  Ok, have fun in your safe space my man."
"Holy shit this channel is great. I've been in this weird in-between area where I don't agree with all hyper left wing social justice stuff, and I also think the 'anti-sjw community' are unapologetic assholes who are so absorbed in their circle jerk they have lost all objectivity (but who occasionally have a point). I feel like I've been looking for this channel forever."
"I did some digging around after Armoured Skeptic's latest video because I recognised you (forgot the channel name though, oops). But I'm glad I found this new channel. Youtube's been full of self-righteous social justice know-it-alls on one side and this tiring 'anti-SJW' rhetoric on the other with very few people who occupy the middle-ground where my own views tend to lie. It's kinda refreshing to take a step back from all the hyperbole actually, even if I may not agree with everything you say. Subbed."
"Interesting how you have an Amazon wishlist already...."
"1. So you are saying that you 'lost interest' when Blaire White's opinions started to differ from your own? Seems a bit vain only wanting your own opinions reflected back at you 2. 'What makes a trans chick cool?' - the same thing that makes any YouTuber trying to make a point cool. Intelligent, well thought out arguments. No gross generalizations. A bit of humour thrown in. Being trans or not is irrelevant"
">Anti-SJWs comment sections are circle jerks Dude, your comment sections are even more of a circle jerk."
"About the junk stuff you should take into consideration that they are friends. It is a different set of rules for friends than strangers."
"LMFAO !  really liked this video , cool to see you back on the YouTubes, hell...  At the end of the day, keep making the videos you want to make and keep being you  , of course I'm sure you already knew that, wait no... You already know that, anywho, peace man, awesome stuff and keep up the good work! Don't leave again ! ! ! :P"
"zomg, the anita shrine, i died"
"Same edgelording without a real point. You tell us that it is an admirable quality to be strong and resilient. That it is. The credo of most Anti-SJWs is that being offended less often would go a long way towards a more livable social atmosphere. I think there is a lot of truth to this. Acceptance comes from interacting as equals. Not from dictating the way of conversing to everyone and crying foul when you are not immediately respected. I think that is the true issue at heart. Not that a Transperson isnt feminine or masculin enough or whatever else."
"Why do SJWs and feminists always insist upon their detractors being MRAs? This has deluded itself into bring the go-to term for the opposers, regardless if they are MRAs or not.  It's reminiscent of Scientology calling their detractors SPs.  I suppose every cult and brainwashing ideology needs it's buzzwords. These are a shortcut of sorts, to thinking, or really, not having to.  I'm myself an egalitarian. I know others that claim to be such, yet get the MRA label regardless, even though I've been as vocal against feminism as I have its male counterpart on the scale of bat-shittery, MGTOW.  Some of us actually believe in things like equality and fairness. And you'll never get these things with a gendered bias."
"This video left me with an after buzz. I loved the shrine scene, dare I say this is art intertwined with something special."
"You know I like blare. She explains trans iseus to a sis person like me without shame language like: All man are sexist All white people are racist All sis people are transfobic."
"here's the thing.  People like 'Milo' are the type of people that will hate and attack biological gender people for being who they are instead of him letting people be bygone. This is their character and how they act upon when on the internet, if anything, if a cisgender person says that, we would also respond back a bit 'harsh' as what 'milo' got. This mentality of trying to fight back the majority and calling them horrible people is not acceptable in my view. We should just cut all of our losses and just move on with our lives and ignore these stupid, bigoted people that are mean to you. Not complain and tell all cis gender people to go kill themselves and telling them they're sexist, racist, transphobic."
"It is amazing how you like to cut down videos for out of context hits. It shows blatant dishonesty and your lack of understanding humor"
"Fuck me, Nykytyne2, and more sexy than ever! Glad to have you back, and apparently, you're making great videos"
"Yeah pretty much, this was you championing people, that on the whole don't want to be championed. And no, I will not treat Trans people they way they tell me to treat them, I will treat every individual I meet with the respect they afford me. And by the way I didn't  miss the fact that the only statistic you showed was about school children. I am actually amazed the rate of harassment was as low as 78% in school kid. 100% of obese are harassed at school. 100% of kids in the lowest percentile 5% of height are harassed at school, 100% of kids who listen to ABBA are harassed at school."
"Great video!  Loved this"
"Wait - Anita Sarkeesian is the Night Mother?"
"Awww...you let the cat out of the bag!!! I thought we were to keep our Anita Sarkeesian alters private!!"
"Oh, awesome! I love your videos! I am so glad you are here giving an alternate viewpoint to people (even though they really seem to hate you for it), and funny as well. :)"
"I'm crushed that its not my pic in the frame that you supplicate to."
"Your videos are in that interesting realm of being funny and informative but still not something I know I'd share due to the off-beat humor. I still enjoy them though. ;)"
"A fairly balanced video.  I think some people forget to realize, that verbal abuse and physical abuse are different. It's true, that context can sometimes be a tricky thing.  Some things said between friends can be funny or let slide, but are serious in other situations.  A 'Yo Mama' joke can be fun between friends.  Saying one, and it honestly offending, can be terrible. However, violence is often terrible, and a normal reality for the 'Other'(no matter who they are).  Big difference.  But I'm a softy.  I had honest guilt over killing Vicente Valtieri and the others.  I'd make a terrible assassin."
"Your throne to Anita continues to make me split my sides. You used such a lovely frame too. The candles and those weird etchings on it that makes it look like it belongs in a cathedral or mosque.  Very well done!"
"Funny and making good points without being offensive? Kudos."
"I love 25i. Be careful, read up on the deaths and slowly increase the dosage (preferably with a trip sitter)."
"This channel is awesome. I love your open attitude towards these ideas. the comment thread is full of great discussion. It might be cool to cite more facts and statistics if they're from reputable sources/studies.   thanks!"
"No worries your tickling balls, just the wrong ones hon... if that's the right pronoun, if that's the case ."
"Keep up the vids. Its nice to see the old youtubers i followed from the start make a come back."
"Look at this boys, this is what happens when you drink the SJW kool aid. Fucking degenerate."
"Nick, your cool.  I like you're videos, and I'm glad that your back.  PS:  grow some balls, bearing."
"this is good stuff. i dont know what all the acronyms are but i guess they could mean almost anything about people and the vid still hits."
"When people dub specific members of disenfranchised groups as being 'cool' they're basically holding them up as an example of what all other members of said group need to be like if they want to be accepted. They think it somehow disproves the accusation that they are bigoted when in actual fact it does the opposite.  When people say, 'I'm not racist, I have black friends!' they're basically saying, 'If you acted like these black people over here instead of like those black people over there, you could have the prestigious honour of me treating you like a human being. So if you don't want to experience racism, just act more like the kind of black people who have white friends and less like yourself.'"
"the feminist dark sisterhood calls to you my sister."
"identity politics is a distraction.  lets all just wear kilts and get on with the important business of killing the rich.  >^..^<  as far as the bathrooms go, in lieu of everywhere investing in a third WC, if you've got a winkie, you have to drain it in the winkie draining room * .. and not because your particular winkie is a threat to the non-winkies, but if they let your winkie in, they'll also let other, naughty winkies in who will take advantage of the non-winkies in the non-winkie room.  *unless you are in the process of one day not having a winkie, in which case, fair do's, you're committed.   you have returned with dangerous levels of badassery."
"Nothing makes a tran cool. Nothing is the answer. But if one is cool, it's because of what kind of person he or she is.Fem-bitches don't understand the dynamics of the human experience because they have personality disorders and don't deserve to be heard."
"Right on point, as always. Glad to have you back."
"I don't see anything wrong with joking with friends that are trabs by asking them about their genitals and boobs."
"I think I found my new favorite channel..."
"78% of Trans people have been harassed for their gender identity. I'd bet that so have 78% of cis people. The question is: How do you deal with it? Do you WANT to be a victim, or do you brush it off? And yeah, I get that brushing it off is easier when you didn't choose your gender, we know from psychology that whenever choice is involved in something, we tend to be more vulnerable.  Eventually, playing the victim card over and over again and rubbing it in people's faces gets old eventually and there is a push back. And hence, people who just act normally and don't abuse a victim status that everybody goes through from time to time despite having a gender or ethnicity that would allow them to become cool."
"I think you made a lot of valid points. There are extremes on both sides and they're equally as wrong as each other. Of course trans people have valid issues to complain about and we should be respectful of that, likewise of course there are some people who take their victim mentality too far and complain about almost everything.  To offer a different perspective here, I think Bearing would see his channel are more of a comedy channel. He's picking out the extremes on purpose so he can make silly response videos back to them for entertainment. He's videos wouldn't be as humorous if he was stopping to clarify exceptions where their might be real issues every 30 seconds.  The truth is right now the extremist SJWs are ones holding the political power. I think there is reason to suggest they need to be ridiculed to some extent to protect everyone else's freedoms such as freedom of speech, which arguably a large number of SJWs are fighting against. I guess I agree there are issues on both sides, but if you're going to pick a side to criticise I'd argue the SJWs are the ones who need more criticism right now. I'd be interested to hear if you'd agree or not?"
"You seem to strongly misinterpret *why* bearing started of the conversation with her making such crude jokes, or why her reaction makes her 'cool'.  Bearing wasn't trying to be a dick, he was trying to take the tension out. The trans-topic makes people uncomfortable, the best way to alleviate that is by making very crude jokes. Once that is out of the way, you know you can talk freely.    And yes, it is a test: Can we actually be honest with each other? Or are you going to try and dictate the outcome of this conversation by becoming offended?  And limiting the conversation that way is fucking annoying, especially if you're actually trying to be constructive."
"I recently heard an interview about what it's like to be a person of color in the punk scene, and how eventually they had come to the conclusion that it's a one way street, to be part of that community you have to be their for white males but white males don't have to be there for you.  A very similar conclusion some 'cool girls' eventually reach when trying to be part of anti-feminist crowds."
"Yes, trans-activists have legitimate grievances. There are some in the anti-sjw crowd, but really not that many who dismiss trans-activism.   You're not paying attention to the arguments of your opposition as well as you should. And where the fuck have you been all this god damn time? You're at square 1 of this debate..."
"Well until she can play YYZ on a bitchin' double guitar she can't be cool anyway."
"While I don't agree with your impression here completely, I do think Bearing videos (from what I've seen of them) are generally near the bottom of the anti-SJW barrel.  Thank you for making an interesting and generally funny video response from a different perspective.  I'm glad that I'm subscribed."
"People in general need to just calm the fuck down across the board. From proud shitlord to SJWs and all across the spectrum. I tend to fall in the Dave Rubin camp, where we want to avoid truly offending anyone, but realize there are bad ideas. Not every trans individual is going to pass perfectly, but if someone accidentally screws up pronouns. My dad is short with man boobs and luxurious wavy hair when it gets long, if someone calls him ma'am, it's not a big deal. If I came up to Milo Stewart in the street my initial reaction would probably be to call him her. If corrected I would change. Same with Genderterroist. Sorry but when I see broad shouldered hairy dude I'm going to use masculine pronouns. If they say call me Sarah duchess of York, I'm gonna be like, cool Fergie how you doin. I understand why the shitlord backlash exists. I used to be a social justice advocate until I realized being a decent person isn't good enough for that crowd. I Used to be a feminist, but then I got to know the crowd and realized I refuse to fight for someone's frothing idealogy. I am a human rights advocate. Period. If someone is legitimately being oppressed I will have their back, but I can no longer stand by and support the victim narrative, nor the cultural relativism arguments. Good ideas should be supported and bad discouraged.  I know I kinda went screedy but you seem fairly rational in your video, and we need more reasonable voices in the true egalitarian world."

"If a person identifies as a rabbit, do you refer to them as a rabbit out of respect?  There is sometimes a problem with treating people how they want to be treated."
"almost looks like identity politics are bullshit and we have to treat people like individuals"
"I guess everything is problematic to some people..  It was a stream between friends who were shooting the shit. Why didn't you pay attention to the comments on my videos saying I made them more understanding of trans people? Or the people commenting on our stream saying how refreshing it was to see a trans person able to joke about things?  Of course you would only screenshot trolls.  Lame."
"found it to be low on substance though i did enjoy it.  i would rather you examine the individual vs collective identity conflicts that is in my opinion the root of the all the tension in these debates."
"Everyone who gets easily offended IS lame, whatever happened to teaching our kids about sticks and stones?"
"While I don't really agree with all of your interpretations, here, you do pose some interesting questions, and so I'd like to share a few of my thoughts. I suppose you can consider me one of the Bearing/Blaire White/Shitlord crowd. Hello!  Blaire obviously recognises the privileges she has, and yes, of course people are going to be more accepting of someone who 'passes'. That doesn't make them bad people. Not that I'm insinuating you think it does, but this just seems like human nature, to me.  I don't think Bearing was giving off the wrong message with his stream with Blaire. Bearing is a **very** outspoken Bear, and obviously knew he could be direct with Blaire and that she'd be okay with it. You're right, though. We shouldn't just be walking up to trans people and asking them about their genitals. I don't think this was a fair example, though. I can't imagine Bearing would ever say that to someone he didn't have a rapport with.   As for the question itself; What Makes a Trans Chick 'Cool'? It has a lot less to do with looks, and a lot more to do with general attitude. I think you've somewhat conflated being easily offended with what is legitimate victimisation of trans people. Having legitimate grievances about the struggles trans people face is perfectly okay. The kind of people shitlords such as myself hold a mirror up to are the safe-space loving, trigger-warning using perpetual-victims.  Anyway, despite disagreeing with you on several points, consider me subbed. You seem thoughtful and have an interesting manner about you.  Signed,  Some shitlord."
"You might as well make a video about defending Evalion, you're already defending one hate group so why not another one?"
"Being cool is a state of mind, not a physical aspect, it's being OK with different people having different opinions, and don't regard your own opinion as holy. Bearing is cool while he's a 'barrel of fun', Blair is cool while being too beautiful to look at or else your retina's will be permanently damaged, and you are cool because of this video, though you're a cross-dressing fag. I can only hope to be as cool as you all, though I get fisted up the ass as the sock-puppet I am. And all that is just a monkey's opinion."
"The bathroom law only requires you adhere to the gender of your birth certificate.  If you can afford hormonal treatment you can afford to get your birth certificate changed to female or male.         Retarded and fat is a pretty good summary of the lot of people's interactions with  'transgender' people.      My evidence for this is anecdotal but I challenge you to look at any one who says they are gender queer, or gender bending etc on dating sites.  That survey claims 47% of those people said they were denied promotion/being hired because of being trans. WHAT PROOF DO THEY HAVE OF THAT BEING THE REASON? There is none, its based on their opinion. I'm not saying businesses wouldn't do that, but if someone's dressed like frankenfurter trying to get a job vs someone who's dressed relatively 'normal' its no surprise who has the upper hand. Similar to why people with tattoos don't get hired."
"You have quite an impressive wardrobe of leather and fishnets.  Color me jealous."
"I'm honoured, you mentioned me in a video about Blaire White.   You should celebrate by drinking a tall glass of bleach with a slice of lime."
"if i not had prepared myself with watching sni snop is miloop videos i had to bleach washh my eyes now i think you should watch the whole livestream not only the best of but thats just my opionion. But i guess my thoughts don´t count as long i´m  not agree that everything is sexist racist homophobic and and and so burn your bra and praise Anita. i dont dislike the video but i also disagree with a lot of things. Keep being weird and offended that so diverse."
"I've had a few experiences recently involving accidentally triggering SJWs and it does get tiresome but they often realise their mistake and repent.   There are post-op trans women (not trans men since they seem to just blend in and vanish) who feel a (possibly) subconscious need to distance themselves from 'trans', that is, to psyhologically transition away from being trans.  That can manifest as this 'im not a victim' mentality (if one associates being trans with being a victim).     My own experience is that I'm suffering discrimination for acting out in a way that a woman 'should not' act, whether that be from a patriarchal perspective or a transphobic perspective.   I never had to suffer such judgements when i was disguised as a male.    There are certain advantages to being female, yes, people are friendlier, more caring, more talkative, etc towards women than they are towards men.  Blair makes a good point, but there's also the other side of things like men being unable to talk to one as an equal because they are thinking about sex.    It's all swings and roundabouts as we say in the UK.   swings not swingers ya hairy pants wearing CD :P"
"Jesus Christ Nykytyne has become a creepy SJW postmodernist."
"Hooray! A new video!"
"I love your videos! Keep up the great work!"
"There really is nothing wrong with being disgusted by people straddling the gender fence...it's biologically hard wired. I'm disgusted by most gay men too. Neither say anything about my character as a human being. I'm also disgusted by fecal matter and rotten meat...which is morally equivalent to being disgusted by poorly transitioned people who spit in the face of the gender binary. Yes, people exist on a spectrum ranging from the (non-existent) platonic male to the platonic female but the gender binary is as real as the x and y chromosomes. Intentionally fighting against this reality will make people disgusted by your appearance and behavior, it's just the way it goes. They have just as much right to be a complete asshole to a fat and ugly person as they do to a gender straddler. It's just not morally right to make people uncomfortable when you can choose to keep your mouth shut."
"I really like your new videos, they are so refreshing."
"You're my favorite demon worshiping hell satanist illuminati 666 pawn of the gay agenda! But seriously keep this up, I love your videos. You should check out Apostle Laura Lee on youtube I feel like you'd get a laugh out of it."
"Cool vid"
