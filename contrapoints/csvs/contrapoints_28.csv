"Response to claims I've misrepresented Hitchens:  1. At 12:10 'Anyone who wants to say anything abusive about or to me' is followed in the original clip by 'at their own risk.'  I don't see how including 'at your own risk' really changes anything. If 'at your own risk' means that he will shut you up and have you removed by security, how is this any different from accepting the 'speaker's kind offer of protection,' except by adding a phony posture of being a free-speech extremist who permits even abusive interruptions (though he, in fact, does not allow them, as the truther incident shows). Conversely, if 'at your own risk' means 'I will engage you and refute your arguments/return the abuse' then this is again at odds with how he handles the truther hecklers.   2. At 10:10 the 'poor fags and wretched women' clip removes the context of the argument Hitchens is making.  In my first draft of this video, I responded to Hitchens' argument here, which I'll summarize as follows: religious groups are always the first to demand the special protection of hate speech laws, and religion is the ultimate source of racism/sexism/homophobia, therefore marginalized groups shoot themselves in the foot by supporting hate speech laws, which ultimately serve to protect their true enemy, religion.  I think this is a terrible argument, because the second premise (that religion is the ultimate source of all or most bigotry) is false. But to respond to this adequately would require going off on a whole tangent about religion that I didn't think belonged in this video.  Though I removed the context of the original argument here, I don't think I've misrepresented Hitchens' views about protections for 'the poor fags and wretched women.' I've read probably half a dozen books and a hundred articles by Hitchens, and watched hours of his speeches, and never seen him support such protections. I think the clip I played, context or not, gives quite an accurate impression of his views and attitude about the topic.  I've linked the full Hitchens speech in my description if you all care to watch it (and much of my audience already has, as it's a pretty well-known video)."

"hitchen's is just an intellectual right winger that tries to hide his bigotry and hatred behind false logic. Hey the rank and file haters need leaders like trump, hitchens, fox news and the daily stormer to name a few of the Anti-Democracy forces.."
"Extremist are all bad, but in the U.S. the right is doing it best to end a free press.  Some one defined trump and the American right concept of Freedom of Speech as anything that praises trump the right as being free speech and anyone that disagrees with them as not free speech."
"If you deny that the leftist establishment and progressive society in America censors certain kinds of speech and opinions, you're either delusional or blind"
"I saw something recently that basically said that just because you are free to say something doesn't include the freedom to force people to listen.  Like if a person knocks on my door and says, 'I'd like to talk to you about God.'  I say no thank you.  Does that mean they aren't free to stand at the curb and say whatever they want?  No, but they can't do it in my living room, on my porch, or in my driveway, and I'm not going to go listen to them if I don't like what they have to say.  I think this came about from some preacher being angry that he was asked to leave a private gay pride event at some place that was outdoors, but allowed people to rent a certain space out.  He was trying to walk right in and yell at the vile 'homosexuals that need to be saved an enternity of damnation' and maybe he truly does believe that's what he's doing, but the organizers of the event called the cops, showed paperwork that they had rented the space for a private event and had asked the gentleman to either 'refrain from harassing attendees and enjoy the festivities or leave' the cops told him that he could stand on the sidewalk a ways over (where there were other protestors abiding the laws) but he refused and was arrested and then wants to claim that his free speech rights were violated.  Like no dude, you were arrested for trespassing or something.  Can I go to your house and walk in and start shouting at you with a bullhorn and then when you call the cops scream about my rights to free speech?  No!  I don't remember what this was in regards to specifically I think it was a FB post I commented on, but you get the point.    The problem is as ContraPoints said in another video (I'm paraphrasing) You're arguing facts and reason with a 7th grader who's rebuttal is to laugh and call you a faggot.  You are wasting your time."
"Can someone explain to me what's going on with those black and white scenes with the chinese?"
"7:26 The difference between those groups feeling uncomfortable vs putting TJ in a gender studies class would be numerous. The criticism exclusive to them because of their affiliation to that group (everyone gets criticism) would actually be based in reality. Someone being called a racist for simply being a straight white male or having dreadlocks for example is a malicious, false, and defamatory statement. Calling a man interested in other men whith an overly feminine manerism a 'flaming' homosexual for example, is not.  The issue would be that there is a very low/no bar for what constitutes racism, sexism, xxxfobia, etc. Like Anita said - EVERYTHING is SEXIST, EVERYTHING is HOMOPHOBIC and you need to point it all out. That translates to made up accusations, over sensitivity and finding these things where there is none to be found.  Being falsly accused IS worse than being accused for something that is at it's core true."
"The Chinese actually sounded like Chinese with some sort of dialect"
"But when will you go into the tangent about religion please i have mean atheists to fight out here and my agnosticism is not much of a weapon"
"Wow. Hitchens' definition is immediately questionable, even without the criticism Natalie raises against it. My opinion of him has really wavered over the past few years."
"The guy who is speaking is insane and doesn‚Äôt live in today‚Äôs reality. I love Mill‚Äôs ideas too for free speech but for gods sake ask yourself if his conclusion or attempted outcome is even capable of being practiced today. New times call for updated arguments."
"I've written down parts of your dialogue so I can remember it. Fuck Hitchens."
"So ... 'not all freedoms are freedoms for all'?"
"Restricting hate speech and nazi symbols is fine by me"
"Really wanted to have my views changed because it would be just so easy to be against the speech that I don‚Äôt like but to no avail. Your thesis is basically ‚Äúsomeone‚Äôs speech is getting silenced so you must choose sides‚Äù when in reference to hate speech, yet only citing one example of where this could potentially be true: ‚Äú____ got called something _____aphobic and therefore didn‚Äôt make a youtube channel and therefore deplatformed‚Äù. However that doesn‚Äôt seem like a very tight argument considering the censorship is self-inflicted and is in no way coming from a position of power over your life (boss/legal gaurdian/etc). If valid wouldn‚Äôt this value then be held to everyone voicing themselves? Artists, aspiring actors, and aspiring personalities, should we be forced to decide whether or not criticism that may cause someone to self-deplatform be limited because it may have the aforementioned effect? Or does this only apply to someone based on their skin color or cultural background? Is the end result of one de-platforming themselves the issue or is the content that drove that result the issue? There are major problematic states with both of these options.   Also last point, to throw away the notion of ‚Äúyou need thick skin to be a public figure‚Äù in a poorly constructed strawman that only is valid if the other side has the specific view about college campuses that you laid out makes it seem like you didn‚Äôt think this part through. It is very valid to make the case that if you are intending on becoming a public figure in whatever capacity that you will receive feedback you don‚Äôt like or straight up abuse. I‚Äôve never seen evidence to the contrary; that someone who has become a public figure has never received negative attention. This is how it has been even before the internet was a thing. Writing this all very quickly on a work break so it‚Äôs probably grammatically f*ed and poorly laid. I hope to see you expand further on these ideas in the future in case I‚Äôm missing something thanks!"
"I really enjoy all the content on this channel, but I gotta say for the record...this is a really dishonest out-of-context quoting of Hitchens.  The message and intent of his full speech was not AT ALL similar to what you are attempting to represent here."
"The difference is between direct calls to actively silence and self imposed silence. The two are just not equivalent in the least."
"Oh my god what? I thought Hitchens was quoting a hypothetical bigot when he said those things, not that he meant it himself!"
"This guy is a complete moron, Dave Rubin pisses harder than this she Male thinks!"
"Amplify minority viewpoints? I thought Hitchens was saying we should just hear all viewpoints and ask why they believe what they believe"

"Where I stand on it is-  BAD: Person A says - a boy dressed as a girl is still a boy  Person B says - transphobe  Crowd says - if you're a transphobe your opinion doesn't matter. As a white male you can't understand. PA get off stage!  GOOD: Person A - see above Person B -         ' Crowd says - we should hear him out then B can verbally KA all over the stage   BAD: PA Says - i'm a gender queer non-binary asexual masculine feminist that is pan sexual gay & straight  PB Says - that's ridiculous. You're an idiot  C Says - Go home. You just want attention  GOOD  PA Says - see above PB Says -.      ' C Says - we may not agree with his definition of his gender. But he can say what he wants  I think true free speech advocates would say there should be no government interference in the words you say and that bad ideas can only be won with good ideas. However, we do need to hear what the person thinks to counteract them. Also a true free speech advocate would say my words don't mean you cn just punch me in the head bc you don't like what I have to say. If you don't like it and don't want to counteract it then just don't listen but don't deny others the right to listen to me rather it be bc they agree, disagree, are neutral, or just want more info.  At the workplace should I be able to say whatever to whomever without losing my job? NOPE  Should I lose my job bc i goto pro-life or pro-choice rally during my personal time? NOPE  Should I lose my job if I goto a rally that the company doesn't agree with on my own personal time but while I'm there i'm repeatedly using my company name to gain access, attention, whatever? YEP   Freedom of speech doesn't mean freedom of all consequences. It means freedom from some consequences. And yes, with freedom of speech you might be offended by what another says. You either don't listen, just call em a fucktard, or explain why that pov is wrong. So the nazi can say their crazy shit and way left libs can say their crazy shit and everyone else can say their crazy shit and we all move on.  I'm not gonna change the mind of Richard Spencer nor do I agree but I listen so if some kid starts saying Richard is right, I know what I'm up against and I can provide counter argument. In addition, I don't really wanna live on the same block as homophobic, racist, anti-Semitic or the way out there leftist that believes you hit when you disagree with someone or just yell so loud they can't be heard so if they can't say what they think I don't know whom I'm living near."
"The freedom to punch enigma 2 in its C# bone flute. autotune the silence."
"There is a difference between someone actually calling you a racist homophobic misogynistic pos, and you not wanting to post a video because you don't want to get roasted by people who disagree with you, and you can disagree with me here if you want that's the beauty of free speech, but that's a ridiculous point. Conservatives are under attack. Ive witnessed it first hand, I wear a MAGA hat and I have been screamed at and threatened because of it. If you think just because someone wears a hat or a shirt that you do not agree with then you can assualt that person, you are surely mistaken. At that point yes free speech is under attack."
"According with the internacional law of free speech this must be restricted when it's a hate speech or the security of the state is commited so the homophobes for example would be doing hate speech trust the law."
"Rightists: Minorities are not protected by the constitution in private businesses! A bakery should be allowed to deny service to a gay couple! They can be gay, but no one should have to help them express their homosexuality! Also rightists: You should be allowed to say whatever you want wherever you want! And you should always have the platform to do so!"
"Ah Jesus. Why can't we all just discuss these issues without insulting each other? You know?"
"You are incredible when I saw that famous line of Mao lol ahahahah thanks for this now I know how to debate with my right wing friends now"
"Great video! Seems like a lot of fuckos will just scream Freedom of Speech at any kind of voiced disapproval of the hateful shit they say. Like yeah Freedom of Speech, but that don't mean Freedom of Reproach my guy."
"imagine keeping this up in 2019 hahahaha"
"I didn't see any of these mayo-ass free speech warriors stand up for the University of Arizona students who got arrested for yelling at the violent government goons of the Border Patrol."
"In response to  8:10, I think the root of the issue is that people aren't just feeling like they have to deal with being called bigots in response to their speech, but that they are being banned from speaking entirely."
"People are being assaulted for wearing a maga hat. That is worse  than the mockery someone will get from saying that diets equal rape"
"I think you‚Äôve made a lot of good points and it is easy for me to say as a white straight (ish) male , ‚Äúeveryone should be less sensitive‚Äù when I‚Äôm part of this western patriarchal structure and don‚Äôt have to deal with a lot of the sexism and abuse that a lot of lgbt. I understand people on the left are very protective over minorities and in many ways that‚Äôs admirable. I also didn‚Äôt know Hitchens came across as such an arrogant chap and I certainly will keep his homophonic remarks in line when he‚Äôs mentioned in future. I agree that more should be done to combat sexism and discrimination including banning persistent offenders. I think your argument seems to have two areas which are problematic. You phrase it in such away that seems to imply a kind of false simplicity where the world is divided into holocaust deniers and victims. Of course fascists do exist (unfortunately) but not everyone who protects free speech is some kind of evil holocaust denier. Secondly, I think part of the problem is that labels like racist, sexist and homophobe seem to have ever expanding definitions while the outrage and hatred directed against ‚Äúracists‚Äù etc is still as strong as ever, again if by racist you mean someone brimming with hatred against everyone who isn‚Äôt white for example, it may well be justified (although even in this case I think it‚Äôs worth considering if we could try and understand someone‚Äôs position without condoning it, there‚Äôs s great ted talk about this by black gentleman who managed to convince several kkk members to give up their robes by sitting down and taking to them , I think about this a lot as an example of tolerance and compassion) to feel hatred against such a person. I think part of the issue with criticising anyone who seems intolerant is that some stereotypes may contain unpleasant truths that we might want to reflect on rather than denying (for example I‚Äôm Scottish and the stereotype that Scottish people drink too much might contain some truth to it, it might be better for Scottish people to reflect on this generally rather than decry it as racist, it‚Äôs possible that there are some gender differences between men and women, if we label anyone as sexist who points out these differences we risk perpetuating lies, or a contention is that Islam in many cases encourages misogyny, if we label anyone who points this out as islamophobic we risk enabling sexism, or in Scotland some convicted sex offenders have petitioned to be recognised as women , been transferred to all female prisons and continued sexually harassing and even raping some of the women there, if every person who points out that a climate where anyone who ever questioned a trans persons right to anything was considered a persona non grata this might enable those offences."
"@13:11-13:33 I agree that you can learn a lot about a person's politics based on which speech they choose to defend and which speech they shut down. And it is certainly true that people are not unbiased about defending freedom of speech. I'm biased in that I wouldn't defend the FOS of someone like Richard Spencer. I'll admit to that."
"On the note of microaggressions, many conservatives think they're 'not real' until it happens to them. Like, 'No WAY did that person give you a weird look or act short with you because you're black! No way! That never happens!' Until someone glares at them in their MAGA hat üòí"

"Painful. If I, as a hard leftist, am fed up with such one-sided, unobjective video, I'm not surprised by the shift to the right among people of initially more neutral or right views. Kind of like ith Vox.. there's great content, but there are moments your just vomit with unobjectivity. No wonder the political scene is changing in the direction it is."
"6:13 -- this is kinda sorta what got Pewdiepie in trouble once, not including the other terrible thing he did later on. dressing up in something 'Nazi' related while making a joke about it. More often than not this is the level at which these 'the left hates free speech' arguments take place."
"Everyone loves free speech until they are criticized."
"Really good video. I find Dave Rubin unbelievably annoying. Especially anyone that engages with PragerU. However, while I think you're right that free speech can be silencing to marginalised groups theres a stark difference between shitting down talks on college campuses than members of marginalised groups choosing not to post on YouTube. Nobody is stopping talk on campuses for feminist or LGBTQA+ panels. Theres my opinion nobody asked for. Great vid though."
"Regarding Peterson and one's supposed right to misgender someone on the job...   Does Peterson actually argue that we have free speech AT WORK? WTF! I am a wage-earning employee and I sure as FUCK do not have free speech at work! What, I'm going to cuss out a customer?  Holy shit! I have to suck it up and be a goddamn professional, no matter what I think, and maybe Peterson should fucking try that, instead of being such a fucking snowflake and refusing to call people by the goddamn correct gender!  He needs to stick his privileged nose out of academia and experience some goddamn reality!  The vast majority of us surrender our free speech rights when we walk in the workplace door, and we pick them up on the way out.  You can argue with that, maybe it's problematic, but it's how it is back in reality. You have to be decent to people when you're on the clock.  You're getting paid for it. Suck it up, princess."
"What amuses the fucking bejesus out of me is that in none of the countries that wank on and on about this horseshit about the ‚Äúleftists are taking my freeze peach‚Äù is one main thing: the left is absolutely not in charge in any of them and has next to no temporal power.  ‚ÄúAmuses‚Äù in this context means ‚Äúfucking depresses‚Äù."
"i wish there was free speech in my country for leftist to destroy :("
"People just fail to grasp that there is nothing bad or paradoxal with intolerance to intolerance."
"I'm not sure the part 'if you don't like to be called racist on campus, that's an answer to your question' is really fair. People getting fired IRL isn't the same as getting heat on the internet."
"Just watched this so I know i'm very late to the party but:   I've very much sided with the likes of rubin for a while in so much as, it looks to me as if the silencing of undesirable views through social pressure intimidation, and de-platforming is an at least somewhat popular tactic among the left wing these days. And I object to this because I believe that everyone, regardless of what they believe has the right to express their belief or opinion. And when you mentioned that the speech of transphobes, homophobes, sexists, racists etc. can and often does have a similar effect on trans, gay and non-white and women it didn't change my mind on the proposition that even the speech of transphobes, homophobes, sexists, racists etc. must be protected. I believe there is a way (although I don't quite know what it is) to protect everyone's speech, to ensure that no one is afraid to speak up. This is where I disagree with you. Because I don't think that you necessarily have to pick a side. For example, I think social support might be an effective tool for boosting the speech of someone who might feel surpressed by that of someone else.   I think that one of the biggest issues that we must wrestle with today is the question of how we protect everyone's speech, and ensure that no one feels too intimidated to speak. I think that social support is going to play a big role in that, as well as social pressure and norms that while not preventing anyone from speaking, direct people to conduct themselves politely and productively and this in fact plays back into another big issue of the poor level of public discourse."
"Mindfuck + Clusterfuck = 'Marketplace of Ideas'"
"Why so many guys miss the times when being jerk was acceptable? I can't understand also that this reaction to empowered women has to be violent. We don't want to destroy men, just have equal rights, is that soooo horrible? Men, let's live together without this battle about who is in charge. Come on, it's not that hard."
"I find it really sad that you didn't seem to notice a major hole in your argument. The difference between ideas and groups of people.  When it comes to free speech, it is fringe ideas that deserve extra protection, not fringe groups!  Holocaust denying, attacks on islam, etc are ideas while women and minorities are groups of people. The mocking of anti vaxxers may very well make them less likely to speak, that is irrelevant to the free speech question. To bad you missed that.  Now, regarding your omission of 'at your own risk'. Hitchens didn't mean that he would shut the challenger down or that he would engage him and refute the arguments, he simply meant that he would take the responsibility of dealing with the person himself (probably the way he saw fit at whatever time) rather than abdicating that responsibility on a third party.  As I'm sure you know, responsibility is a pillar of freedom especially in the Anglo-Saxon tradition.  Too bad you missed that one as well.."
"Well, damn. I have a lot of re-thinking to do."
"4:50 You can't pick and choose who has the right to speak. That's not how rights work."
"Had no idea about Hitchens.... Damn, that was painful to watch."
"Free speech only guarantees that the government will never silence someone‚Äôs pov. It does not guarantee protection from social consequence nor does it guarantee that everyone must have a platform. It is just as much my right to fee speech to say that I don‚Äôt want to listen to something than it is for another person to say said thing"
"hitchens is overrated"
"well, the left really is against free speech. I am not a great fan of milo, but the fact that a person like him is banned from twitter is appalling. he is clearly not a fascist and is just conservative and that's OK. people should be able to say everything (the exceptions would be an explicit call to violence and lying about somebody) and we should all be adult enough not to break when we hear somebody criticize our ideas. I'm offended by many things people say and think, but people still have the right to say what they want. people shouldn't be fired or silenced just for being conservative. conservative ideas are as valid as progressive ones and both have their place in the discourse."
"I've been surrounded by ultra-conservatives most of my life, even in college, and I've only recently found this station, and I always knew the alt-right was BS, but probably agreed with them on a lot. Platforms such as these aren't too widespread. How could the left be against free speech if they don't have a platform?"
"Couldn't agree with it more. Philip Larkin was a fucking beast tho."
"Contra, I would loooove if you made a video about your favourite books, or books/documentaries/films or those that you recommend."
"They are not for order but for anarchy, essentially. Strongest (richest) wins and gets to decide the rules. They don't like the rules so they behave like a bunch of teenagers, at best. That's cool and all. But in civilized society you can't just swear in meetings or on job interviews. Or to your Mom. But of course, unless you're the President Agent Orange The right just doesn't have any principles which they pedal. They sincerely believe only in guns and bullying."

"Stop saying the word ‚Äúnazi‚Äù unless you have proof of what any of modern people are related to nazis otherwise you just seem like someone screaming bullshit."
"first off im liberal. now having said that yes liberals do hate free speech. they dont try to limit it in such ways as preventing books to be written or published, they do it much more subtly, like getting you banned if you tell a joke in an mmo they dont like. ill stay on that example because i can hear the gears turning and i havent even posted this yet, and i want to give a lesson to those that would respond in the way i already know youre about to so just wait a minute before you do. a natural response is 'well they only reported you its a gm that decides whether to act on anything if you broke a rule' thats partially true in the age of algorithms and automatic actions taken by them (right youtubers?) but if the gm is as sensitive and doesnt like certain combinations of words strewn together in a humorous way they toll will behave in irrational ways just as the person that reported you in the first place.  oh and the joke in question is this one that i told on the eonar server in world of warcraft: *man goes to see a doctor: doctor says -- dont worry youll soon be at peace man asks -- im dying?! doctor says -- no your wife is*  yes that joke got me banned in world of warcraft. nothing more nothing less. believe it or dont but its true."
"I completely agree. As a Brit who knows the ideas of his toxic brother, Peter Hitchins, I find Christopher completely overrated, verbose and outdated. He supported the Iraq war. That should tell you everything's."
"You're trying to compare the silencing effect of harassment and hate, versus the deplatforming of anyone who's not left enough? I find that position completely untenable. Let's say in your perfect utopia where all the Questionable Youtubers lose their channels, never get to speak again and have to go back to stocking the shelves at Walmart, you've done absolutely nothing to affect the problem you describe. Racists and trolls and harassing assholes will still be all over the place online, and everyone will still get slammed by them simply for putting themselves out there. There is no changing that. You can't escape hate no matter what political positions you hold.   You're presenting a problem with no real solution and making the assumption that shutting down dissenting voices is both necessary and positive. I reject that completely. Your whole premise here is false. You want to put a band-aid on a gaping wound, and despite the fact that you've stated multiple times that you're not optimistic about the reason and rationality of the average person, I find the idea that removing voices like Rubin and his guests from public discourse could somehow 'fix' society and quell online harassment bafflingly optimistic.    I wouldn't cry over the silencing of Richard Spencer and a lot of Rubin's guests, but their ideas don't disappear just because they were silenced. If anything, you force random internet commenters to spread those ideas and spam them everywhere. Every instance of deplatforming is, to them, more 'evidence' that they're right and the Powers That Be are trying to sweep the 'truth' under the rug, and thus more reason to come together and make sure that ideology can never be fully contained. Honestly I'd consider it fairly likely that shutting down those voices would have exactly the opposite of the effect you want. After all, these big public figures generally aren't rallying their followers to attack people or instigating attacks themselves.   Yeah, fully free speech does mean some people's voices will be silenced. If you just let anyone talk, someone's going to start chanting KEEP YOUR HATE SPEECH OFF THIS CAMPUS and nothing can be done to shut them up or talk over them. Speech is shut down by other speech. If there's anyone we need to silence, it's the chanting idiots, the trolls and harassers with nothing real to contribute... generally just those whose speech is intended to silence others. If there's any real headway to be made here, it's on that front."
"Philip Larkin is an incredible poet - the best poet, actually, imo. I strongly recommend reading him. He knew about The Darkness. Probably never said anything pithy and quotable about free speech tho."
"the only time speech should be restricted is when someone attempts to leave a conversation and is followed by the person talking to them. any conversation between willing individuals/groups should not be subject to any censorship. I don't care how horrid the thing being said is. private companies should be allowed to create whatever speech policies they want in their workplace. speech should absolutely not be inhibited on the internet since if you don't like what you are hearing you can literally leave the conversation at will."
"We need more like you- thats about the best I can say after watching about 6 of your vids in a row. I consider myself a centrist, just bc I don't know what else to call myself. I tend to put a middle finger up to both sides of the establishment bc I see shit I hate from both of them. I would LOVE to see you sitting across from Rubin tho."
"Woah I took the wrong side. Thanks I‚Äôm on my way to yours."
"You have given me a voice when I feel silenced"
"The people that say that don't know anything about human rights and Freedom."
"7:38 so it's about yourself not about what you say. you would rather be silent than have your feelings hurt or your words picked apart by the right (even though we all know they are just biased and there is nothing that will ever change that)   that's the problem. your speech is valid regardless of criticism. you should be able to use criticism to reshape the way in which you make points and work toward a point where your words are really hard to criticize. the haters make your speech improved."

"The jump from Hitchens/Mill marginalized speech (at 4:00)- content - to marginalized 'speakers' - source - was really elegeant. It almost seemed like you didn't even see how huge the difference was yourself.    In Hitchen's/Mill's point, what matters isn't the speaker. I don't care whether I am been sold homeopathic crystals by a black native american jew or a white african muslim. The medium is not the interesting part for speech as a mechanism, it's the content.    Buried deep within that switch and bait lies a worldview that somewhere between reading ways of seeing and today, you have replaced the view of the search for truth as primary, with a meta-physical view of the world that basically conforms to identity politics. Where there is no individuals or truth, only a big random sauce of constructions that are narrative advancing some identity group's relative position in society."
"This sounds like Schoenberg. My piano teacher used his stuff to torture me."
"Rewatched this one again nearly 2 years later, and still surprised by what an awful take it is.  Your worst video by far.  Really hoping you're thinking has progressed since then."
"I think Hitch was sarcastically saying ‚Äúthe poor fags, wretched women, etc‚Äù as though that was someone else‚Äôs less than generous opinion of gays and women in this context. From what I remember of his autobiography, he was a bisexual man? I don‚Äôt know how he identified later in life, but I don‚Äôt think he seriously thought of gay people in slurs.   In the past I‚Äôve felt like maybe I was less than ideal in embracing free speech because I wouldn‚Äôt want to tolerate a holocaust denier barging into a holocaust memorial, and because I wasn‚Äôt entirely and inconsolably heartbroken that the neo Nazi fella got sucker punched. I am inconsistent and listening to this made me feel a little better about it. Because I can sit around and calmly listen to these jokers from a place of privilege and relative safety doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else is not going to be negatively affected. I think debating with these fringe or hateful ideas is fine and all, but I think it can‚Äôt be forgotten or overlooked that the core of some of these people aren‚Äôt just doing thought experiments. They‚Äôre voting, and raising children, and harassing people, or complicit in systemic violence to some degree. An idea doesn‚Äôt have value just because someone blurts it out, and frankly I don‚Äôt know. I feel a knee jerk fondness and defensiveness for Hitch, but some of my other Hitch lovin‚Äô friends have skewed towards the whole ‚Äúhow dare you not listen to this nazi calmly‚Äù territory, which is a constant point of contention for us."

"No, there isn‚Äôt a choice to be made on what side of free speech you are on, the truth is majority and money will win out, I for one want to hear what the majority and the rich and the powerful have to say."
"What would be the problem in calling someone a racist if they say racist things, and believe racist things, when they say, if you can‚Äôt stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen. I agree, listening to racist or homophobic ideas on the daily, at every point would be exhausting, but it‚Äôs honest, it‚Äôs out there, it‚Äôs open, and people can respond to it, I honestly don‚Äôt see a negative here, perhaps it incites violence, but then that would only be a symptom of a cultural malaise that ought to be tackled rather than silenced. And yes, the draining and exhausting environment of having to experience droves of ideas that clash with your own is taxing, I‚Äôd much prefer to be taxed emotionally and insulted daily than experience a load of falseness by silenced people, while living in a bubble of contentment."

"Hitchens is overrated."
"I am for all forms of free speech.¬†  I think a person should be able to share their political ideas without fear of losing their livelihood no matter how repulsive their ideas will be to me. I think this is especially important in the internet age where something you have said ten years ago that you may not necessarily believe now can come back to haunt you.¬†  As far as hate speech suppressing the speech of oppressed people I think it is up to the oppressed people whom want to speak to speak up regardless of the negative comments and backlash they will receive. It may feel sucky but if you are brave enough to speak then you should be brave enough to deal with the consequences. However those consequences shouldn't be economic destitution."
"You speak Chinese???"
"It wasn't till I got to the 11:00 minute mark that I realized how much you misunderstand Hitchens.  You missed his point about free speech entirely. The thing that suppresses free speech within the individual is fear of not being accepted, fear of being silenced...in other words, insecurity. But, you want to silence anyone who might make them 'feel' unpleasant. Hitchens is suggesting we need not waste our time protecting peoples feelings as they get in the way of free-discourse. But that is in a public forum he's talking about. In a private setting, a workplace, school, etc...well your own rules apply. If we stop the conversation for everyone who gets emotionally twisted up...it goes nowhere. Imagine if we all succumbed to the evangelical whine of 'the war on christmas'. Who decides where to draw the line. I love your videos. You are terrific, smart and sexy, not that you need my validation...it's just me speeching. Thanks"
"Hitchens would have adored you and propped you up. Maher annoyed me for comparing that weasle Yianop... with Hitch. Hitch was not without his internal conflict, or occasional hypocrisy; he's human afterall. Nontheless, he was an exceptionally smart, charismatic, and sympathetic person. He loved conflict and sought it out if only to learn something from it, but also because it thrilled him. He was simply pointing out (in allowing the platform for everyone) that knee-jerk revulsion is hiding and not taking on the argument fairly...by refusing to hear it. But, the truther...how do you know he didn't already have an interaction with him previously, outside the venue? Watch again and you sense that Hitch is very quick to silence him because he already knows what's coming. As a speaker, he has a right to try and steer the ship to it's destination with running into every jagged rock along the way."
"Can you please go on The Rubin Report? That would be beautiful."
"YOU ARE AN AMAZING CREATURE, YOU CAN BE BOTH A WOMAN AND A MAN THAT IS A GIFT."
"I agree with your points on both societal pressure against hate speech and limitations in the workplace and appreciate that you acknowledge that legal restrictions on free speech should be carefully considered as they can be extremely dangerous, keep making sassy, awesome intellectual content."
"You made a couple of bad faith arguments in this video. 1. A trans person being afraid to upload their videos on youtube because him/her/they are afraid of the comments they'll receive isn't ''being silenced'' because no one ACTIVELY prevented them from doing so, it was solely up to them to chose not to. I mean, c'mon!! And 2. Citing Shapiro as an example of someone who will engage with students on uni campuses frequently while getting heckled, don't you think that there's a difference between posting a video online and reading through the comments posted by viewers after the fact, and having your event shut down before it even starts or disrupting the event while it was ongoing by, say, setting off fire alarms or shouting a speaker down?? I mean, the former allows you to speak first while the latter prevents you from doing so altogether, so why compare/conflate the two? 3. Some forms of speech dampen other forms of speech???!! Huh? What now? How does that even happen? 4. Expecting Dave Rubin to have something to say on the subject of how ''bigoted attitudes and speech could silence (insert identity here)...'' would be like expecting an NFL commentator to talk about the NBA during a football game, not really his lane, is it now? Plus how are you allowed to pick a side and he's not?  5. The mischaracterization of what Hitchens was saying, my word!! Lol, I could go on and on but I think you're too far gone down the SJW rabbit hole to see any sense whatsoever. That said, great video though."
"Youth is only a physical virtue and it is strange how old and stale and rehashed young ideas can be these days. Arrogance is not a virtue."
"What marginalized people?  Where? Not in the United states anymore. People marginalize themselves. What I mean is there are far less marginalized people now because attitudes have changed.  Speaking as a minority who has been on government aid, but really speaking as a human being, the government aid is what helpped me keep me marginalized. There are factors you are just blatantly ignoring like Trump would.    Youth is only a physical virtue and it is strange how old and stale and rehashed young ideas can be these days. Arrogance is not a virtue."
"Ok, fine then how are people who never argue their positions not totally mindless and wrong in their position?"
"Convince individuals of the ideas you think are right. Maybe don't chant your yearnings at a whole group of people. Seriously,  will anyone be persuaded by mob mantality? They will tend to be pushed in the opposite direction. Duh! What's that? Huh? You got nothing? You will ignore this comment because why?  You hate debating individuals and prefer propaganda and coercion as a means to an end. Why? That's right you don't have to think about anything because you are soooooo teriffic and perfect. What's that üëÇüëÇüëÇ,  I can't hear you.  Ok, fine then how are people who never argue their positions not totally mindless and wrong in their position?"
"Yes, allow a holocaust denier to speak and have faith in human beings to come to there senses.  The far right is just a very small minority and if you assume the intentions of people what does that make you?"
"People don't understand the difference between the consequences for what you say from the state versus from citizens. Deplatforming is not violating your free speech its just saying that we don't want to listen. No one is forcing nazi speakers to invite transgender people to their rallies..."
"I understand where you're coming from. I agree that deplatforming mano a mano, be it through social pressure or private intervention should be allowed. I also do agree that queer people, people of colour and women can be disheartened and silenced by hate speech. I haven't been a target of hate speech, but I think I kind of get how marginalized groups can be silenced by said speech. I've had plenty of times I didn't want to go into an environment I felt was hostile to me (not to the extent of some of what has been thrown at marginalized groups, but still). But presenting this whole thing as if we need to chose which side we're defending kind of necessitates I choose to defend the FREE SPEECH DEFENDERS TAKING A FINAL STAND AGAINST THE MARCH OF LIBERALS. Jk but I think the problem at play (if we take the issue as you represent it) can be solved by analyzing it objectively. What option allows the most people to say their opinions? Well ensuring free speech protections for everyone, however hateful, means that the only group who will be less willing to speak isn't objectively forced to not speak. I'm not trying to use the 'if you can't stand the heat argument', I get that it would be hard to speak your mind in a hostile environment, but choosing the other option objectively prevents a group of people from speaking, as in they can't speak or they'll go to jail (or whatever other punishment may be incurred). No option is truly right or wrong, but I think we're in a position where we need to cut our losses if the debate is as you say it is. If we want everyone to speak equally, I think the best way to do so is to nurture a less hostile political environment. These people who spout hate speech have been created through a lack of contact with that which they oppose (in our case, marginalized groups) through the following process:  - Timmy looks on the internet - Timmy discovers Ben Shapiro - For whatever reason, Ben Shapiro resonates with Timmy - Timmy goes on his social media platform of choice - Watches more Ben Shapiro - Is suggested videos that support Ben Shapiro - Argues with someone on another social media platform supporting Ben Shapiro - Social media pushes posts that agree with him to increase engagement - Timmy sees more and more videos and posts that agree with him (and conversely misrepresent those that don't), and is recommended almost nothing that doesn't agree with him - The misrepresentation of the other side makes him resent them deeply - Timmy is recommended a video by someone from the other side who has experienced that same lack of contact - Any joke about his side or argument in support of restriction of speech is deeply offensive to him Rinse and repeat. The best way to break this cycle is to break the wheel; change the social media algorithms that only recommend posts you agree with. It would take a long time, but soon politics would be far lest hostile and we wouldn't be having the free speech debate."

"If you go to jew watch.com most of the articles are from actual jews , wealthy jews, openly saying theyre behind all the things 'nazis' are claiming they are lol. Thats the crazy irony is that they admit their roles in all the things theyve done to try and hurt white countries to which 'nazis' accuse them of. Whatever a 'nazi' says about jews their sourcebis from the jews themselves and than mentally ill people like this creep say its a conspiracy."
"I have just wasted a few hours watching left wing youtubers. The only argument you ever make is 'Nazis, Hitler, Racism' while never acknowledging the purported facts, you just ignore the arguments while the altright will counter every bit of info you put forth. . Your simply saying a holocaust denier is wrong without ever explaining why, despite the fact its been proven in court rooms by forensic scientists that there were no actual gas chambers, something easy to look up.    The difference between your speech and the speech of 'racists' is that youre wrong. You want to block truth. Left wingers can spew whatever nonsense they want without repercussion, they com.it violence ecen and the judiciary lets them off. but any white person who points at the IQ map and all the implications of pointing out why it matters is subject to losing their livelihood. Yes the left is against all speech that is right of karl marx and this is one more video that proves it."
"It's a shame that the POINT was missed in fundamentals of these topics in favour of the author. Shocking how SJW's have no respect for any ideology other than their own (Not really #NihilismInDisguise) #notrellysocialjusticebutpersonaljustice"
"I've never seen such a subversive and clever rhetorical video like this before on free speech.  Contra says,  1. The non-conformist = the minority; not necessarily, conformity only requires more than one person to act in parallels, the minority as you see it is not the driving force behind the idea of an individual's right to speak/listen to different information/views. It's about the idea of having that right, not whom it applies to, because it should apply to all. 2. The internet = College; I'm sorry what? This part really isn't an argument, it's just a turnabout 'No, you' fallacy 3. Hitchens won't defend your right to speak if you're a woman, a Jew or a Muslim; Not true, just because he is being inflammatory in this section here (https://youtu.be/4Z2uzEM0ugY?t=1184 - 19:44 if the link doesn't work for current time) doesn't mean he doesns't believe in your legal right to free speech, which makes it seem like you tried to misrepresent him to your viewers. You can't guarantee your audience has even watched his speech. Some of them have, but I'm sure most of them are unaccounted for or haven't.  4. Part of you has a boner for C. Hitchens... Does that mean it's a half boner? *lol* 5. Video on Hitchens at what appears to be a small community event/gathering? From 2007; Where you add that 'some forms of speech tend to suppress other forms of speech' I still don't understand what you mean by that? Are you saying that because an individual is inconsistent with defending the right to speak of others that... the government should do it? The point is too vague to be made meaningful towards your rhetoric. It would definitely be against freedom of speech to submit the right to any arbitrator. To assume the system is perfect is a flaw on your part. Just because we believe and defend in free speech, does not mean every single person will be granted free speech every single time. It is a natural chaos that we have to accept and err on, rather than defer to Big Brother, for on a system as large as Earth, only the individual should know or have the ability and right to discern information and decide what he should or should not consider. It is possible that you are simply criticizing the idea of the right to free speech and offering no solution? I'm not sure. 6. 'It's not the right side' according to who? That's the core problem here.   I am starting to understand why your videos have so much traction. They have a lot of great editing, high quality, there's even some cool skits thrown in there for good measure, and your rhetoric is as persuasive as (in my opinion more persuasive) as Sarkeesian's. It's well presented, you look awesome BTW, and your arguments are very tricky to see past, but anyone with an eye for detail and critical thinking can see this is just plain smoke and mirrors. The truth is: No system of governance will ever be perfect, and the first amendment is an exact counter to that, for what it's worth. The right to freedom of speech should always be defended by both conservatives and liberals because it is what allows people to hear different view points. It doesn't matter that it's not perfect because it never will be as we are living breathing creatures who make mistakes. But the biggest mistake we can make is in normalizing behavior that may lead down the path of recent times in history. Who is to decide that? I'm not sure, that's why I'm here in the first place, because your right to speak/listen is just as equal as my right to speak/listen."

"I like some of what Hitchens said, but I don't always agree with anyone nor do I always disagree with anyone. Much of what he said about religion was spot-on, but I took exception to his rationalization of invading Iraq, is excuses for mass torture, etc.  I may agree with some of what Sam Harris says, but he also argued for the disaster in Iraq, also argued for mass torture as a public policy, and unlike Hitchens has begun openly using white supremacist debating tactics in which he carefully implies something racist, then endlessly denies implying something racist, but won't explain what he was trying to imply. He's even embraced scientific racism of late.  The 'four horsemen' did everyone a favor by pointing out that religion had an unearned position of privilege in society in which it was taboo to ever criticize religion even as they were calling for the genocide of homosexuals or attacking rape victims or making excuses for racism or whatever.  But thanks for stating all of this stuff so clearly. You've organized your thoughts on this so much better than I have."
"FOX News won't give me my own show, therefore FOX News is brutally suppressing my free speech rights. Free speech means every outlet has to provide a platform for everyone's point of view, FOX News will not give me my own show, therefore FOX News is attacking my free speech rights."

"'Classical Liberal' = Fetishistic Reactionary"
"My view of free speech is that anyone has the right to express any opinion they have. It doesn't mean you can express it in any way you want, nor that people have to listen to it, and it especially doesn't mean that people can't criticize it (that would be contradictory). So, while you are allowed to state your opinion, you can't harass others in doing so (like the Westboro Baptist Church protesting at funerals), nor can you do say in a way that incites violence.  People also shouldn't be forced to give anyone else a platform. This is especially true if there is a limit to how much the platform can be used. For example, only a certain number of people can come to speak at a college, simply because there's not enough time and space for an unlimited number of people. No one has the right to be one of those few people who get to speak. The college has the right to choose who gets to be one of those people.  I also specifically defined free speech in a way that excludes lies. You have the right to say what you believe, but lying is saying what you don't believe. No one has the right to willfully spread disinformation. Free speech doesn't protect slander or fraud."

"Because I'm not a racist. Because I'm not a transphobe. I balk at these terms because they're inaccurate, and applying them to people who just don't agree with you cheapens the term so that when actual misogyny and homophobia happens, it's met with rolled eyes and declarations of 'not this shit again...' It's a gross, inflammatory statement designed to undercut an argument that actually has validity.  TJ Kirk is a loudmouth misanthrope, but as someone who regularly consumes his content, I can say he is most assuredly not a transphobe or a homophobe."
"You are wrong. YouTube comments have no political or any real social power. University hate speech codes can ruin your chances of getting an education, i.e. ruin your life.

I'd rather be called a faggot on YouTube 10000 times than be the target of impenetrable institutionalized bureaucracies."
"I really wish that verbal discrimination or dissent against minorities ended at people just disagreeing. If that was the extent of bigotry that people endured, then we wouldn't be having a conversation about free speech and protections for minorities."
"The depiction of Hitchens is necessarily one dimensional, over the course of his career he went from being a Trotskyist to an advocate of American militarism.  The issue is you made him look like a bigot.  He supported reparations for African Americans, stated the key to economic freedom of the third world was the liberation and reproductive autonomy of women, and debated a catholic archbishop with Stephen Fry where he defended homosexuality as a form of love."

"I think both the extremist right and extremist left have more in common than they want to admit to themselves, and that often both extremes are often babies when it comes to ppl disagreeing w/ them, and many only believe in free speech when it's on their side, which is highly hypocritical. Often they want to whine about lack of freedom of speech just b/c someone disagrees w/ them, and both the left and the right will encounter trolls they need to put up w/. In a perfect society no voice should be silenced, not just b/c I believe in freedom of expression for all (which I do) but, b/c if one can silence the evil b/c they're unpopular one can just as easily silence the good and open-minded as soon as it becomes unpopular. Also w/o the freedom to express oneself, u will have no idea if one truly sincerely accepts u and is a good person, or if they're just obeying the law, and secretly hates u. However, if a person is in a place of business, they have a right to limit speech on the job that would scare away potential customers, or make other employees uncomfortable or feel in danger (like w/ harassment or bullying) ect, b/c what they say can cost a business money by alienating or upsetting ppl. I do agree in some cases, sometimes u have to take a side, however by law, outside of business, ppl should be allowed to say w/e they want, good or bad. The danger mainly is in allowing ppl to make laws regulating speech, regardless of what is being said, for even if they are silencing evil brainless scum bags, what's to protect good open-minded ppl from the same being done to us when society's social and political climate changes and they assume good ppl r now the bad guys? It's naive to think they can't and won't silence the open-minded as quickly as the bigots once they're allowed to make laws regulating free speech b/c all govts want to control the ppl, even our own. As a lesbian I hate bigotry against gays and lesbians (I hate bigotry against women, and races as well) but, if a person wants to call me a dyke and say w/e offensive bs they want, they should be allowed to do so. I, in turn should be allowed in return to say 'fk off u bigoted @$$hole!'. I don't like hearing what homophobes, and other bigots have to say but, at the same time I rather know who the enemy is rather than think an enemy is my friend b/c they can get thrown in jail for expressing who they truly are. I would use a trans persons pronouns, but if one wants to not do so, I don't think they should be thrown in jail for it (which they can now in Canada, and NY). I think even if one's an @$$hole, it's good to know where they stand, and not just think they're great ppl b/c their freedoms are limited. Sorry if this is unnecessarily long but, anyways...our freedoms should only be limited to when it enfringes on another's rights."

"I accuse you of straw-manning by choosing Hitchens. You took the words out of my mouth. Sincerely. Jon Haidt is the person you need to take on."
"Forget about Rubin. He's certainly not the best person to debate on this issue. You need to debate Jonathan Haidt."
"I love most of your works but for some reason this one didn't really hit home for me. I am a Peterson fan so maybe I'm just too far down the rabbit hole to see the whole picture clearly OR maybe somethings missing or not delivered well. I don't really know. Thanks for talking and trying to get the message across. I commend you for your effort and hope society get's over this hurtle of figuring out how to represent everyone fairly and safely soon."
"I am a libertarian and I 100% agree with you Contrapoints. I've noticed my fellow libertarians and classical liberals always rush to the defense of nazi's and people with rather, controversial views. However I never see them go the opposite way! Everyone I know who defended Roseanne Barr's tweets went after Sarah Jeong for her tweets about white people. Now while I find BOTH in poor taste, I believe they should say whatever they want, and of course they should be subjected to whatever social consequences face their action. By believing in free speech, that applies to both sides of the aisle. You are free to vocalize your opinion but you aren't free from whatever backlash you might receive from it. Now of couse there are people who will have typical kneejerk reactions and accuse you of being a bigot depending on how they interpret whatever belief you hold, but that's part and parcel with political discussion and its inevitable."
"One thing is that this is almost (and saddly, slightly shifted) very  american focused.  You can be a racist or hate or just uneducated on racial issues or whatever gross thing there is..  but in many countries.  Thats punishable to a degree.   Youre fully able to say 'fucking kill the jews'. But a lot of countries will take that as damaging and with enough hate.. you can be detained for everyones safety in case of you acting on it.  America doesnt enforce it, and thats a tradeoff.  Yes, you do get to say whatwver you want (if your white and not being challanged by authorities) but you also create racial tension that causes.. well.  American racism.  Is it worth it, to say someone is lesser for their race, unhindered?"
"You need to tune your piano and then upload musical performances"
"I've always considered Hitchens to be an overrated pompous gas bag myself, so I am glad you chose to focus on him.  I used to read his articles in the Nation, and I still kept reading him after he went off the deep end supporting the neocons invading Iraq.   Then he was reborn and deified in the Freethinker community by people who didn't know about his past."
"I love the super weird surrealism clips in the middle of things"
"Preventing some speech because of its potential to silence other speech is a very very dangerous precedent. Does not, for example a particularly strong line of reasoning in certain settings apply a social pressure that might prevent a crackpot from spouting nonsense? I know it‚Äôs a slippery slope argument, but with regards to speech regulation, I want to hear it addressed anyway. It‚Äôs not very hard to imagine such a policy being rampantly abused by the state to silence dissent."
"The opposite of 'racist' isn't 'people of colour' (at least not without a bunch of debatable intermediate steps).  Otherwise, great vid with a lot to think about."
"Free speech should only be given to people who are willing to keep their mouths shut about their opponents for the rest of their lives. It's like the charm Dumbledore put on the philosopher's stone,  it only appears to people who want it but won't use it."
"I've seen a few of your videos and would say I stumbled across them, but we all know how the algorithms work.  You have unique talent. Many times in many of your videos you found ways to sneak in Easter eggs for those in the know. Keep it up. So few of us nerds get to hear so many ideas expressed just so."
"Woe I was so taken back when you started speaking Chinese. You did a good job! :o"
"Video is on point."
"A lot of people really do get irrationally angry anytime they‚Äôre even mildly called out for racism, sexism or any of the phobes. Then they claim that ‚Äúnobody can say ANYTHING these days without being labeled a racist/sexist/any of the phobes! Aren‚Äôt you TIRED of it?!‚Äù But I have a hard time relating to this as myself & my husband aren‚Äôt accused of these things & I assume it‚Äôs because we don‚Äôt say racist/sexist/any of the phobes type of things. We don‚Äôt feel like ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt say ANYTHING!‚Äù because these aren‚Äôt things we say anyway. I have a hard time sympathizing with these people because it‚Äôs truly much easier to just be a respectful person than it is to be AnTi-pC sUpEr aLpHa nOn-CuCkS. Are they free to say whatever stupid shit they want? Yes, but they‚Äôre not entitled to smiles & nods of approval. People are free to counter their opinions & if they want to spend their lives tirelessly defending how ‚Äúnot racist/sexist/any of the phobes‚Äù they are, then have fun. I‚Äôd rather spend my life making new friends & not waking up with a chip on my shoulder every morning."

"I agree with almost nothing you say but love watching your videos"
"Are you actually equating a guy personally not wanting to discuss 9\11 conspiracies at his own event to that of protecting free speech at a governmental level.... this is so juvenile honestly. Do I believe in 9/11 conspiracy, no, do I think they should be penalized at a government or institutional level, no. Would I discuss every fuckers 9/11 conspiracy, no... idk why you are making the argument that ‚Äúbecause he had a 9/11 conspiracy theorist thrown out, that means he‚Äôs in fact not for free speech at all.‚Äù Didn‚Äôt you get a masters?   Idk your specific advocation against spencer, but if it‚Äôs simply not allowing him to speak at your event or whatever... that‚Äôs cool. But if you‚Äôre advocating actual laws that penalize someone for saying shit, that‚Äôs not inciting immediate violence, than that‚Äôs an issue of limiting free speech."
"I‚Äôm okay with social pressures, not okay with the other two levels. Society should be behind the changes in institutions and their governments, those changes shouldn‚Äôt be forced on society by its institutions or government.   I can just stop talking to fuckers, and they me... but I shouldn‚Äôt have to fear being expelled or fined or jailed or something for saying ‚Äúblacks are criminals‚Äù"
"The ‚Äòcampus free speech crisis‚Äô is a myth. Here are the facts. Myth #1: Young people in general (and college students in particular) don‚Äôt support free speech  In fact, the opposite is true. For nearly 50 years, the General Social Survey (GSS) has asked Americans about their tolerance for offensive speech. Some questions include: Should an anti-American Muslim cleric be permitted to teach in a public school? Should the local library stock books hostile to religion?  On almost every question, young people aged 18 to 34 are the most likely to support free speech. Check out the data for yourself. Not only are young people the most likely to express tolerance for offensive speech, but with almost every question posed by the GSS, each generation of young people has been more tolerant than the last... https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/03/16/the-campus-free-speech-crisis-is-a-myth-here-are-the-facts/?utm_term=.8254a851775b  Trump however, and his followers paint the media as enemies of the people."

"Yes, the left are very much against freedom of speech, and you citing legal limitations in speech that isn't protected by the 1st Amendment doesn't give you the excuse to further restrict said speech especially if those speech don't even fall into ''inciting violence'' or such.  Hate speech =/= illegal speech  LEARN THE DIFFERENCE!"
"omg I thought I was the only one who vomited at Maher's comparison of Milo to Hitchens"
"Just reminding you're commies ;)  i love your videos but i think it would be wiser to not dig your on grave."
"I don't care about microaggressions on either side. You'd have to be a weak person to let micro agressions determine if you live your life. I don't feel sorry for youtubers who get criticized...this is a tough business. And calling people racists all the time will not help you or anyone with reducing micro aggression. Such a shallow argument."
"A question: I'm a bit confused about the title being in serbian, is there any special reason for it?"
"Yes, because someone called me racist once, and that means I'm being silenced by the government and we live in a dystopian hellscape. ... Whaddya mean 'that's not how free speech works?' Go back to Tumblr, you NPCSJWOMGWTFBBQLOL."
"Can someone explain those little sketches to me? I'm a dumb dumb and i like shiny things."
"What if the woman is a misogynist or transphobic? What if a person is transgender but anti-trans rights? Are you not reducing people to their outward presentation? Is a black conservative not black? Is his voice more or less marginal than a Black Lives Matter activist? If you belong to a marginalized identity group, but then espouse ideas that marginalize you from the marginalized group you belong to, are you more or less marginalized? Does it not appear a bit arbitrary to pick what counts as truly marginalized?   The issue as I see it is that you can‚Äôt answer these questions without choosing a side (which you admitted to). Setting up the conversation as us vs them is bound to make inclusivity impossible. There‚Äôs some empirical evidence to support this. Heterodox Academy (who I think you mentioned in the credits) is working very hard on this very issue. It may be necessary to stop talking so much about the ways in which we‚Äôre different, and talk more about the ways in which we are the same. Setting up the conversation as a zero sum game is counterproductive."
"This is actually one of the only videos I‚Äôve watched that is just plain wrong, and kinda dumb. The reason a classroom is different from the internet should be obvious. The fact that you don‚Äôt see them as different is pretty telling.   I agree that being called racist and such shouldn‚Äôt bother you if you are confident you aren‚Äôt being racist. I get called all of those over used words all the time. There‚Äôs two problems with this. One, it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúmicro aggression‚Äù if it‚Äôs constant and backed by a credible threat of force. When you lose your job or get removed from class or expelled from university because something you've said is ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù that‚Äôs not a micro aggression. That‚Äôs more akin to overt racism than micro aggressions.   If you continue to allow the left to over use important words whenever they feel they‚Äôre losing the argument, we will all lose the ability to distinguish actual racists from people who leave argumentative comments in a YouTube comment section. Those words lose credibility. And the people most deserving of that label can shake it off to slip into the mainstream.   Also you must see how trying to determine who is marginalized and who isn‚Äôt is a fools game. I understand the exercise when the conversation is explicitly about political power, but when the conversation is about what rights we do and don‚Äôt have it gets really dangerous. You can easily imagine passing some kind of well meaning but  draconian hate speech law, to only have that law used against those it was meant to protect."
"You‚Äôre awesome!!"
"before hitchen died, he was really laying it thick on 'women aren't funny.' Which lead to 30 rock creating the 'TGS hates women' episode, and of course, Hitchen said nothing about 'Oh no, my period, lets nuke England!' Anyway, Pegged by a large Lizard woman, that is tempting entertainment."
"jesus that hitchens clip is something. So thankful I broke free from the new atheist cult."
"The left IS against free speech. If some guy tries to speak about men's rights feminist don't let him speak and acuse him of defending rape."
"I like listening to you but I think that you are dead wrong here. Being called a snowflake won't get you fired, it won't get you doxxed, it won't get you attacked by Antifa. I think that the left has ruined the terms racism and Nazi...and not in a good way. I'm apolitical and I don't consign to the two party paradigm because it's ultimately the same thing. One side fights for imperialism while the other wants a corporatacracy. You both fight for someone to rule over you at the end of the day. You both play into the hands of the true elites, fighting each other and going back and forth. Meanwhile the ones who rule this world are sitting up high and laughing."

"Concept: Hate Speech is mass-slander. So not just disliked speech but speech that harms the reputation of more than one person with a shared trait using a false claim. It follows from the established principle that slander is not free speech, that truth is not slander. It merely recognises that more than one person can be the victim of slander and removes the absurd limitation that a person must be specifically personally identified in slander to be slandered when the slander of all people with a trait clearly attacks all individual people with that trait."

I don't think they're objecting to being corrected for calling someone a slur...I think they're objecting to the fact that other people disagree with them. They want to impose their views on other people. They aren't sad about call-outs they're sad that people aren't being racist (phobic, oppressive, etc.) with them"
"Hahahaaa I can't stop laughing at 6:10"
"yes, next"
"I LOVE THIS VIDEO!!! Thank you so much!"
"I think you misunderstand Hitchen's point in the quote you have of him. He said nothing of extra protection for marginalized people. He said nothing of the person at all. For one, he was only giving a reason for listening to someone with unpopular opinions, he said nothing of mandating it, or about extra protection for people with unpopular opinions, nor do I think he thinks there should be at all. Second, he was talking about their opinions and not their place in society.   I have followed Hitchen's teachings a lot as well, and I've not seen him supporting special protections for certain people above others. You're right about the inconsistency of his stance in a few instances, but as you said in another video, '.. every definition is perfect if you ignore everything that doesn't fit the definition.' No political stance is perfect either, but if you don't apply the extra meaning of special protections for marginalized people, a lot of people think his stance is the best for the most people. Yeah, it is potentially the most beneficial for marginalized people over everyone else, but it is not necessarily the most beneficial to them, or to unpopular opinions."
"this guy is a dipshit fogot lol"
"13:11 I think you can mainly learn what speech, he think is opressed most. Hitchens talks about protecting opressed speech, Then when he protect holocaust denier and ridicule people who think that women, jews etc. speech should be protected, He merely judge which speech is more opressed, not which is right, at least in his opinion. Therefore at least in this clip he wasn't a hipocryte"
"'Why can't you just deal with being called a racist on college campuses?'  This is both a good and a bad point. Firstly, people should respond to 'racist' with 'what's your proof that I'm racist.' You're right that, in the course of your life, some shitlord calling you a racist shouldn't be a big deal.  That being said, you're conflating being insulted behind your own online alias by people on the internet, as opposed to being insulted by angry people who are close enough to physically assault you (and college students have been documented as doing exactly that multiple times in the last few years).  Not only that, you're conflating Youtube (an entertainment platform) with colleges, which are viewed as gateways to employment. I have a much more important reason for attending class in college than I do for watching ContraPoints videos.  So in summation, while I do think everyone needs to suck it up when they're being insulted (because honestly what does it matter), comparing insults online versus being insulted in-person at your gateway to economic success is a terrible comparison. Point deducted."

"After I quit drinking I regained my senses and also quit watching Sargon, Thunderf00t and all the others. Quite an additional relief, actually :-) Btw, I see you drinking a lot in your videos -  I don't quite get what you're trying to get across by displaying yourself saying smart things and then cutting to yourself pouring some strong alcohol down your throat. Just an obervation from someone who's really seen the darker side of that stuff and who believes that drinking shouldn't be glorified or displayed as something totally normal and harmless. Is this meant as some kind of satire or are you trying to show how emotionally disturbing these topics are for you?"

"I think the biggest issue about free speech is not about people saying 'you can't even say racist things without being labeled a racist anymore', but the fact that people will actively look at institutions to punish people for their right to free speech."
"I take issue with the whole civil discourse for a fews reasons: 1. When you do something shitty then someone has to call you out on it, it's how you learn and grow as a person. Liberals, Centrists, and Democrats fall into this every time they don't want to grow as people so they gaslight those who are oppressed and guilt them into accepting abusive and toxic behaviors from their oppressors.  2. Civil discussion and making a compromise only works when there's something to be gained and a deal could be reached. We benefit. For example, I could maaaybe have a civil discussion with a Liberal but a member of the alt right? Forget about it. What's to be gained? What could Richard Spencer possibly give me? What kind of compromise could we reach? Should I hang myself from a nice oak tree to save the white supremacists the trouble? Don't call him racist because it'll hurt his feelings?  3. There's this weird ass false comparison between the Leftists like Anti-fa and the Alt Right when it comes to violence. Violence is also a political tool; The Slave Rebellions happened because the Africans that were taken to the United States to provide slave labor didn't want to be slaves, Harriet Tubman didn't just use some tunnel to lure people to freedom she was also a fucking war general, The Revolutionary War is why we're not a British Colony, and you have Stonewall which was started by queer black and brown people, it was a riot for LGBT rights. Nothing in history was accomplished by peace alone. That's a fantasy fed to us to keep us complacent. The Leftists use violence as a means of self defense while the Alt Right uses violence as a means to uphold the status quo or rather make things worse. If I came to your house then raped you, beat your ass every night, and then steal from you, what would you do? What you really waste your time talking it out with me? 4. As far as censorship goes you have a greater chance of being doxxed, threatened, or murdered if you speak in favor of civil rights as opposed to promoting genocide. This didn't start with the alt right mind you, this has been a thing throughout history. Martin Luther King was assassinated not because of his wanting to overcome segregation but because he started discussing reparations for slavery, several Black Lives Matter figureheads were found murdered, Gamer Gate harassed and doxed several women speaking about sexism in the gaming industry, and etc etc. The Black Panthers((The REAL Black Panthers)) were dismantled by the CIA while the KKK were able to have parades, I remember the ones from when I was a kid. Anti-Fa is now deemed a terrorist organization but we still have the Proud Boys, Oathkeepers, & the KKK who are recruiting within the military and the police force.  5. There's nothing the other side hasn't said we haven't heard before. Yada yada yada blacks are lazy, gays are immoral, the Jews run the world, women shouldn't have power, and other greatest hits. Going back to 2, there's nothing they could offer me. Free Speech covers everything except hate speech and when we uphold the notion that we should tolerate intolerance then we get a sexier and new Jim Crow or Nazi Germany. When good people be silent and do nothing, these people get platforms to recruit people. Why should I feel bad that a white supremacist was unable to influence young minds on a campus? What 'good ideas' is worth my expense?   This bullshit is really just a form of gaslighting. Great video btw, I'm glad I found your channel despite the shitty comments."
"I don't agree with either of the examples of people you've given, but I'm also not agreeing with you. I disagree with Hitchens failing to let the 'truther' speak, as much as I agree that the 'truther' is wrong he has the right to voice his wrong opinion. I think there's a separation between freedom of speech and harassment. To go up to someone and declare sexist or racist things is harassment (unless explicitly requested, such as 'do you believe X?' and then they must still be as polite as someone with such wrong views as they have can be), but to talk about them isn't (even if they have a platform, as people are free to not listen). The problem comes in when crowds of people walk up to right-wing (or even left-wing who have differing opinions) and scream racist/sexist/homophobic/Islamophobic/etc. because that would fall under harassment, but to politely say 'Your statement is homophobic' isn't harassment, it's when you scream in people's faces. I don't support harassment, but I support free speech. I equally don't support those who go into comments and insult people based on their gender or transitioning or whatever else because that isn't polite and would fall under harassment. Otherwise we would have the problem where things like feminist movements would have been silenced by the ruling beliefs, thus free speech must be protected even in cases where you don't agree with it."
"The problem is that being liberal went from being dangerous and radical, to being rebellious, to being hip and cool, then got diluted into the mainstream as the Boomers started to age and now liberals are just viewed as 'the establishment'.  There are always folks out there who are looking  out for'the establishment''s insidious plots to control us, no matter what the actual principle is.  Voices from the mainstream are taken about as seriously as teens take their parents, the old killjoys who 'don't get it'.  The current rebels aren't necessarily conservative in the traditional sense but they are decidedly anti-left."

"@contrapoints '10 points to gryffindor, 10 points indeed' I still come back to watch this video just for that line. That and you ruined hitch for me. My boner for him has become flaccid.

You are right we do recognize which types of speech people like Rubin are so quick to defend."
"Been watching you vids. The problem is that the vitriol of the left IS just as bad as the hate speech.  Oddly enough, I've become a centrist in current politics, and voicing a CENTRIST opinion has been met with accusations of hate from the people I sympathize...  Meanwhile the conservatives hover around like Jehovah's Witnesses, wondering when I'll convert. (I'm a huge cocktease to them and their ideals apparently)."

"I agree with you almost completely. One thing I want to add: that 'first level' of free speech, the legal level, in my view includes public universities. When the entity restricting the free speech the government or doing so on the government's dime, prudence dictates that we must condemn such restrictions. In my view, anyway. Also, I don't think that marginalized speech should necessarily get 'extra' protection at the *legal* level. As you say, that forces you to take a side, and I don't feel comfortable having a government with that kind of power.   As for institutional and societal free speech restrictions, those are clearly just in many cases and ought to be legal in most cases. When comservatives complain that calling out racists suppresses their free speech. I get a migraine. Similarly, it makes sense for the institutional and societal free speech protections to devote special effort to protecting the speech of marginalized and unpopular views.  Great video as always!"
"The reason that we draw the line at actual, physical abuse threats is because that actually has the power to silence speech. Mean comments and bullying aren‚Äôt actual force. The problem with trying to make ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù a thing is that it is an attempt to utilize the state to actually enforce silence."

"The difference is that abuse online is not the same as abuse in person. The latter can and often seems to lead to violence. Also if you disrupt a lecture theatre you are actually preventing someone from speaking. For it to be analogous to commenters, college students would have to be just standing quietly outside with signs or something, not triggering fire alarms and heckling in videos.     The closest thing to what the college students were doing would be alt-righters flagging your videos for nazi imagery. That's the only way extreme viewers can prevent speech on youtube."
"I like how you use the actual accents in your Chinese, it‚Äôs alright!"
"It seems to me you might be conflating the protection of the right to free speech of one group (the 'oppressive' group, in this case) with the protection against abuse, of the members themselves (as opposed to their right to free speech), in the other group (the 'oppressed'). At this point in time, anyone speaking out for/against anything on the Internet will be subject to verbal or written abuse. IMHO it is important to distinguish between protection of the right to free speech and protection of the people themselves.   On another topic, one might also weigh the right to free speech of a speaker against the appropriateness of his/her speaking on a particular platform if doing so involves payment of fees drawn from funds contributed to by, say, students, if their majority are against such speech."
"I love your videos, but...  1. You are really stretching the definition of 'microaggression'. It's not just a small aggression.  People mostly seem to use this word to describe either a kind of social clumsiness born of a failure to take another person's sensitivities into account, or, alternatively, sly digs actively aimed at those sensitivities, but in such a way as to avoid open confrontation. 'Call-outs' are neither of those things. The confrontation is open and deliberate. It is a white feather of sorts. The basic argument is: 'I know what you are. I find you disgusting. I don't need or want to hear any more.' It implies that the addressee has said or done something truly heinous that no human being in their right mind should tolerate. It's a rhetorical nuke. The target must either abandon the conversation or scramble to clear their good name.   Of course, this nuke has a massive recoil. Not only does the amount of reputational damage you inflict go down with every successive use, it also causes people to take your other, totally unrelated, statements less seriously. You get written off as a shrieker.  2. I don't think, it's about picking sides. I think, it's about the degree of egregiousness. To justify shutting somebody up, the damage inflicted by their words has to be not only tangible but severe and unacceptable to society as a whole. That is the argument for shutting up quacks and conspiracy theorists. What they say undermines all sorts of demonstrably useful knowledge.  3. In the West at least, the conversation about the voices of marginalised minorities is mostly about *how much* of a voice they should have (and just how everyone else ought to respond). You really have to go pretty far into far right before you get to the people who literally believe that women, black people, etc. should literally be quiet in public. (We are not counting the trolls who say stuff like this to look edgy or to get a rise out of people; we are talking about the people who honestly do believe that a Handmaid's Tale sort of society would be a good thing.) Whereas, with the Holocaust deniers, there is a fairly mainstream conversation about using legal tools to actually prevent people from saying certain things."
"Your hilarious and educational,  I love it"
"Yes you sjw leftists really hate free speech even your own videos prove it. Just think about how many videos there are about how horrible white heterosexual males are and how they should just shut up while racial and sexual minorities are insulting them without any proper arguments. No wonder you're considered insane when all you can say to your critics is something like 'You're a fucking white male!'."
"The central argument made in this video is that speech is a zero-sum game, and if speech 'x' is being allowed, then by definition speech 'y' is being suppressed. Therefore, if you truly care about free speech, you need to pick a side and actively suppress the speech you don't like. lol, the fuck sort of shit-brained argument is that?"
"It's fine if you call Rubin/Shapiro/JBP or any other non-leftist speaker a racist. The difference is that while the crazy left calls them racist they ALSO endeavor to de-platform them without the need to engage them. Drowning out their speech with your own is also a form of censorship."
"True story: I was at my alma mater to hear a speech by a cabinet secretary. When the secretary began to speak, a group of protesters in the back of the room interrupted him ... with chants of 'Free speech! Free speech! Free speech!' trying to drown him out.  So far, I haven't seen a better incidence of the selective deployment of the concept."

"The way I see it is that free speech should aim to be neutral as possible. If someone wants to call me a racist, a bigot or a sexist, that's their right and I'd never try to silence them on that. At the same time, I do believe any opinion should be free to be shared. Whether or not that opinion is entertained is down to the person receiving it."

"10:01 after that short clip of Hitchens, he continued:   '...look anywhere you like for the warrant for slavery, for the subjection for women as chattel, for the burning and flogging of homosexuals, for ethnic cleansing, for antisemitism: for all of this, you can look no further than a famous book that‚Äôs on every pulpit in this city, and in every synagogue, and in every mosque. And then just see if you can square the fact that the force that is the main source of hatred is also the main caller for censorship.'  How you came to the conclusion at 10:18 is beyond me.  The point you were trying to make at 12:21 is absurd. They are fascist crackpots. What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence."
"I did not listen to your advice I‚Äôm sorry my queen"
"My wish is to see a one on one of ContraPoints and JP. Her mind seems just as sharp and focused as his that she could easily shut him down like so many people can't. I mean, it'll probably have to be uploaded on RedTube or something but it would be so delicious nonetheless."
"I know you're smart and I've come to like you for your weirdness after binging on your videos, but what's more weird to me is how you can't see it the way I see it (it's a human thing). Obviously everything you said seemed reasonable, but it didn't paint the picture fairly, otherwise I would have no problem.    Who determines what constitutes a racist, homophobic, islamophobic, xenophobic, misogynistic behavior? If you pay attention, you'll notice how these terms have been weaponized mostly by leftists, who often conflate things to make it seem like everything is about people's identity. Just recently in my country a lawyer was involved in a controversy because she was making a huge scene in a hearing and refused to obey the judge's order to leave the room, so they had to call the police. And now the mainstream media is saying it was an abhorrent act of institutional racism, because this lawyer is a black woman. Do you see what I mean? This is just one example that happened yesterday, but it's recurrent in many countries in the West.   When you state that dichotomy like 'oh do you wanna be on the side of racists or people of color? misogynists or women? voldemort or harry potter?' The conclusion most people have is to choose the Left, which promotes itself as the 'good side' and the protector of minorities. First of all, no one chooses to be on the 'bad side'. But the answer to what that means is not that simple. Like I said, what is the measure and who is in charge of determining what constitutes those things? Were the judge and the police in that incident racist? Is hating third-wave-feminist radical politics misogynistic? Is insisting immigrants should legally enter your country xenophobic?    That is the danger in silencing people in the name of 'protecting minorities'. It will eventually boil down to tyranny. I don't agree with people who spew undeniably hateful things about other groups of people, obviously. But those people should just be ridiculed and avoided. Setting things on fire to protest Ben Shapiro speaking at your college campus is idiotic and actually fascist.   I understand that actual hate speech can be silencing to the people at the receiving end of it, but where do we draw the line about what hate speech is? Because in many instances hate speech seems to be what people disagree with. Freedom is ultimately at stake when you have dangerous ideologues lurking a scenario like that."
"well.... i mean legally isn't free speech just your right to speak against the governing bodies of our nation without consequence of legal action against your person?   the government owes you free speech and a platform to boot, and regular people do not - you can't walk up to someone, insult them, and then claim free speech to protect yourself from retaliation. they have the right to and often will retaliate."

I guess I would be classified under this whole centralist person or normie who's kinda just heard things from random people and developed opinions that haven't been researched well enough to support. However, a lot that you say in your videos really brings light into my life on what to think about all that's happening, and you answer practically all the questions I would ask otherwise. Thank you for existing. You deserve more followers and views, and definitely more attention by the masses. You have a gift of drawing in a lot of people who may view liberalists as sorta wacko and letting them leave feeling a lot more educated I guess you can say lol."
"Most people have a problem because leftist is against hate speech and want that censored in public discourse , which isn‚Äôt really supportive of free speech. If you truly believe your beliefs are superior to others , you should be able to convince the opposers that your beliefs have validity , if racist , homophobic people and bigots are given that validity it‚Äôs open to ridicule and debate that will prove those ideals bad . No ideology is inherently bad every ideology is ‚Äúgood‚Äù to someone"
"And there is only one type of free speech that dampens others right to speak, and that is the demand that someone has no right to speak."
"And it's not about being called racist in academia campuses by idiots (a white SJW was calling Peterson nazi and racist, for example, while students of color were defending him), it's about literally and physically not being allowed to speak (same video with Peterson, and many other videos with SJWs when they are making noise in order to literally shut up the opponent). Throwing ad hominem at someone(like saying that Peterson is a nazi)  is quite OK IMHO, stupid people have the right to free speech too. But in order to not harm other persons right to speak freely, you just have to wait for your turn to say something. So, beat the opponent with the arguments, not with loud noise and interruptions."
"Basically, if you're bigoted, sure, I guess you have the right to say what you believe, but you'd be expecting special treatment if you thought that others didn't have the right to call you out on your bullshit because you're not the only one with freedom of speech here."

"That clip is taken out of context and you should have played what comes after, for as much shit I may get for saying that phrase that is a meme at this point.   I think you're being intentionally obtuse. I agree with all of your points on not giving platforms to these people, but when people talk about the left being anti free speech they are pointing to speakers like Milo, sargon, and so on being invited to a speak, and then through violence, threats, and making so much noise no one can hear anything else. That atmosphere on college campuses that is causing comedians to not do shows there. Calling in bomb threats to a black metal show because you think they are racist (marduk). These are actually issues and they make everyone on the left look bad."

"Listening to this as an outsider (i am cannadian). All this drama between the anerican 'left vs right' really sounds like a tv soap. I need pop corn everytime I hear it."
"Maybe we just need to scrap the debate about Free Speech entirely and look deeper about what the argument represents: a mutual desire to protect the ability to have/be/do... {standby while the world's leading social scientists get together and delineate the following instinctive drives/needs that lie under the exchange of speech in human civilization. I'm just some dude leaving a Youtube comment, not a think tank - shit!}"
"The 'left'doesn't hate free speech, but SJW warriors do. SJws are not 'left'. Or 'left'changed it's meaning completely from the time my grand-grandfather became communist, and when he and his brothers along with my young grandfather fought nazis. The 'left' I grew up with were not easily triggered . I mean, yes, of course, bombing cities and burning villages along with killing a bunch of people triggered them to fight nazis, but it triggered them to fight, and not to whine, and what triggered them was pretty much solid reason to be triggered. I was triggered by the fact that one of my previous employers exploited workers by not payed over hours, and, frankly speaking, often with not payed at all hours, so I quit, sued them, and exposed them in public. And I was totally pissed when I found out that SJWs gave themselves the right to change Michael Ende's books because 'they may trigger some sensitive groups'. WHAT THE FUCK? That man's father was prosecuted by nazis in WW2. That man refused to join Hitler Jugend, which was pretty brave in that time in Germany, that man wrote a book with beautiful, kind and brave black boy as a main character of a beloved children book, and those fuckers dared to change his writings? And they changed Pipi The Fucking Longsocks for fucks safe! Of course they hate free speech."
"So i got 2 arguments that work for youtube but not universities.  1. Youtube is a corporation and has no responsibility to protect free speech. Most universities are government funded and have that responsibility.  2. Youtube did not ask people to come, the people came on there own, which means anyone can show up. For universities, both the student and the university have to accept each other through the application process.    Also on a side note Your chinese accent is definitely better than most white people's but it could still use some work, mostly smoothing it out."

"Didn't JS Mill talk about 'freedom of thought and discussion'? A marked difference from simple blanket free speech."
"The complaints from classical liberals about the left silencing  free speech are not about marginal 'micro aggressions' against opposing views on Islam and feminism... the complaints have been formed because: 1) there is a growing number of cases where American campuses have to cancel presentations of 'alternative' speakers due to unsafe circumstances, usually meaning antifa attacks and rallies in the city of a particular campus.  2) There have also been countless times when students attempted to boycott many of the kept events by literally silencing the speaker with constant chanting and shouts of curse words and slurs. Despite university protocols the police and university guard services don't act accordingly to shut down these interruptions, probably out of fear of fabricated accusations.  3) new campus rules can ban certain 'language' the left deems to be harmful towards certain communities- for instance questioning gender theories or critiquing third way feminist ideologies despite none of the suggested alternative speakers propagated hate speech against gender/race/minorities in a legal sense; and yeah, there is a legal definition of hate speech; it is not entirely a subjective issue. In countries where law against hate speech is applied, the law sanctions speeches and written literature based on its intentions and not on its content. Authorities have the right to ban any content that has well articulated intentions to incite physical (!) violence, torture against certain groups. By definition, Julie Bindel should be in prison for her publication where she explicitly suggests 'all men should be put in concentration camps'."

"I totally agree that the criticism of right wing media that 'the left hates free speech' is false. Very good breakdown. I always say it like this: If you are pro-inclusion, you aren't going to include someone who's anti-incluision, separatist, or isolationist. That would be stupid and contradictory to the goals of pro-inclusion. It's not hypocritical nor is it shutting down 'free speech' to say that anti-insclusionists are crushing the rights of people who should be included and they shouldn't be given a platform. Giving them a platform to spread anti-inclusion rhetoric is harmful to the rights of people who should be included. If you are pro-inclusion, do not defeat yourself by including anti-inclusion voices. Great break down of that logic by Contrapoints. It really is picking a side."

"defending the right of a thief to due process doesn't mean defending thievery. Thievery is just an example to defend a prinziple. Hitchens selected one of the worst examples he could think of, Holocaust deniers. That doesn't mean he is defending them, it shows how low they rank in his opinion,. Using thieves for this example could cause some people not to understand the point, if they think stealing is not so bad... but you can expect almost everone to understand the holocaust deniers are bad, so this is a good example."
"I really don‚Äôt think you have to choose a side at all. You say bigoted speech ‚Äúsilences‚Äù marginalised groups but by the same coin people talking shit on bigots silences them the same way.

"I‚Äôm on the left but when I hang out in left wing areas I feel terrified to have even a slight disagreement because I will be shut down completely, being called a Nazi and ignored. Even though I actually agree with them just I a different way and have a different point of view. Other friends of my who are also on the left have the same problem. Just because I‚Äôm not far left doesn‚Äôt mean a Nazi. I think there are definitely people out there that abuse the use of actually important words to shut down others that aren‚Äôt as far on one spectrum as they are. It waters down the term and make it less powerful when it actually deserves to be used. People shouldn‚Äôt label EVERY left leaning person as ‚ÄúSWJ Scum‚Äù and people should not label EVERY right leaning person as ‚ÄúNazi‚Äù because it doesn‚Äôt help with actually good discussion. This channel makes me feel like I can actually speak my mind for once and not be witch hunted for being slightly closer to the center than people want or expect of me. Love ya videos btw.

"Personally, I feel like a lot of this issue can be dealt with by designating different spaces for different conversations, similar to how we already designate certain spaces as SFW or NSFW and have different norms regarding the permissibility of explicitly sexual discussions in those spaces. I'm coming at this from a leftist viewpoint, but nevertheless, I can see the value in having spaces where people are free to express bigoted views. For example, someone who is both racist and struggling with depression may need a space for recovering from depression where their racist comments won't be criticized because they're not in a fit mental state to respond in a healthy and reasonable manner to those criticisms. Or someone who holds bigoted views out of sheer ignorance may need a place where they can ask dumb and bigoted questions and receive honest, respectful explanations. Or someone who is struggling with internalized bigotry may need a place where they can air the negative self-talk they're experiencing and have it challenged by people who understand what they're going through and can give them good counterarguments. Or some people may need spaces where they can examine whether certain bigoted stereotypes have a grain of truth in a scientific manner, because proper science requires not dismissing a hypothesis simply because it's upsetting to people and has been used to harm them. Meanwhile, other people need spaces where they can take a break from the bigotry and just be themselves, or explore higher-level discussions without being bogged down in 101 explanations all the time. And these people cannot all be served in the same space."
"Disagree 1000%. Just because you can bully people until they stop saying what you don't want to hear, doesn't mean they aren't still thinking thoughts that would offend you.

"Free Speech's main and most powerful argument is not it's virtues, it has little, but what it defends against.  When seeking to dismantle free speech or at least change it's definitions and use I urge people to consider the downsides of what they are doing.   Take the youtube example used here. People are intimidated to get their ideas out because they fear the hate they will get. Free Speech protects the hate, not the person from getting hate. Thats bad, yes but its not that way because people support the hate. It's the alternative, which is worse, that is the reason Free speech is the way it is.  Hate is easily interpreted into anything you want it to be really, maybe you have very good strong ideas of what is and isn't hate... well sorry but there are even more sensitive people out there who think hate is something even more all encompassing. The worse thing about it all, once you've made the mistake of damaging free speech in this way. You can't go back, because even suggesting it would be 'hateful'."

"The main issue I take with this is that the only free speech prohibition level discussed in this video is the only one that objectively doesn't exist and that is 'level 3' as it is denominated. And all further arguments are based on this.  In my humble opinion, the idea that speech can indirectly silence other speech is preposterous and and useless in nature. 'Shut up' is understandably a form of speech that directly suppresses another, however 'feeling that your voice is not empathized with by the fact others may not share it' whether it be on youtube or a gender studies class is not a suppression of speech. In any case, you're suppressing your own, and you alone are responsible for that. If you have the platform, take it. Or be a pussy about it and complain, whatever floats yer boat. The problem becomes when the platform is restricted or taken away from an specified form of speech (e.g. hate speech prohibitions).  Therefore, it isn't contradictory or inherently biased to protect all forms of speech since any form of speech that directly silences another is neutral to ideology. No matter on where in the political spectrum you're on, 'shut up' can be used by anyone.   Speech comes with responsibility; the same way you are allowed to say whatever you want, others are allowed to say whatever they want in response. Except silence you.  Remember folks, equality of opportunity over equality of outcome. As long as there is a platform there is free speech."

"Cross-dissolving Hitchens to pouring a glass of Johnny Walker black  with a splash, brilliant. Hitchens always used JW as the most deft backhanded compliment."
"You make a major error in your discourse: you assume that the use of words like 'homophobia' are always used correctly; that is, that the people using such terms have correctly identified someone who fits the description. This is not the case‚Äîfor example, the labeling of all Christians who hold the historic and biblically accurate view that sex outside the realm of monogamous, heterosexual marriage is wrong as 'homophobic'. (The beliefs do not necessitate hate or fear of homosexuals.)   Since this is not the case, your assumption works to protect the speech of those committing harm against others‚Äîfalsely accusing‚Äîwhile restricting the speech of those who have done nothing wrong.   Ultimately, if you want to get close to solving the dilemma of the inevitability of silencing speech in some manner‚Äîthe answer not being found solely in whose side you choose to be on, based upon how you feel about the group morally‚Äîyou need to not push for a culture that gets bogged down on who it is that is speaking‚Äîthis only works to create true oppression and bigoted marginalization over time‚Äîbut rather push for a culture that values truthfulness, (classical) logic (as in real logic, not the form of asshole trying to sound smart type of 'logic' that exists all over the internet), patience, and gentle correction. Rather than trying to give a concrete group identity to those whom we ought protect in such situations, we ought simply protect the speech of those individuals who are speaking truthfully and logically; those who are willing to patiently disagree with another, letting them speak freely and fully without jumping to conclusions; those who correct gently and respectfully and do not resort methods like screaming so loud a speaker cannot be heard.   Thus, a case by case approach must be adopted. For, since these will not be achieved in the ideal collectively by any speaker, we must learn to approach each situation with a level of toleration that allows for as close to unbiased examination as can be made as well as a willingness to endure the inevitable tension that is created by such an examination.   There's a bit more to it, but who's really going to read this?"

"As a naive centrist, I think that the 1st amendment is enough. I do not have a problem with, for instance, YouTube banning Alex Jones videos - to me, that is not an issue of free speech since YouTube is not a government, it doesn't have a monopoly on violence. If the alt-right wants a streaming service, they can start their own, like they did with conservapedia when they thought wikipedia had a liberal bias.  Private universities have a right to speech codes, deplatforming, and all that jazz for the same reason. They are not government institutions. State universities... is another matter. They are representatives of the government and has a duty not to infringe on free speech, even if it distasteful."
"Any logical person would know the difference free speech and hate speech"
"I think the cause of the blind hypocrisy is the perception that their views are constantly shut down, not knowing that the 'oppressors' who attack free speech do so to defend the rights of minorities. Historically educated and socially aware people attack misogynists and racists because those views have been protected throughout history, causing minorities to lose their vocal power, and lower/middle-class, uneducated white (mostly) men see this as a first action against the First Amendment, not seeing that it is instead a reaction."
"It's bordering on sophistry to say that de-platforming a speaker at their own event is the same thing as de-platforming an obnoxious member of the audience who dereails the conversation."

"They actively choose not to speak up because they are not confident enough like you. If they prepare for their videos like you do, they would be perfectly fine speaking their mind and making videos, but their personal limitations they set on themselves comes from a fear of being harassed. And your response to the get out of the kitchen thing makes no sense! Why can't the classical liberal be upset that you called them something they might disagree with? that's what they mean by free speech and feeling content with sharing their emotion with you, and for you then to respond with data and evidence to back up your claim, and then they listen to you and rebut their evidence/data , and then at some point y'all die or come to some sort of conclusion... i dont understand this video. im drank btw i hate Dave Rubin and his fish lips.."
"Your videos are great"
"Hitchens is not here to 'defend' himself, so I will just state how I interpret his words when he says something to the effect of (at around 10:30): That he would defend the holocaust denier, but not (various victimized groups) right to free speech based on their group identity.    I take it as you state your speech, I can answer your opinion or try to understand your point of view, but your genitalia/sexual orientation, etc. doesn't make your speech valid or invalid, nor does it give weight to your arguments. Either way, how can I respond to you being trans? or female? your ethnicity, etc. I mean, it's kind of interesting as a discussion subject, however you can hardly argue about these aspects of life. However, the last thing I want is to have to characterize you as a person from that angle, it's just not that interesting in the long run and it certainly won't make me want to be friend or not with someone.  Now, the outward appearance (ethnicity, gender, fat, thin, height, smell, even clothing I guess, etc.) obviously has a place in helping us make initial judgement on someone and we work our way from the stereotypical initial impression we all get in some way...   Your videos are great and very entertaining!"

"It's quite obvious that the postmodern left doesn't believe in free speech, because it by nature rejects many of the liberal principles that serve as the premise of free speech. As is typical with this branch of the left, the ends are what matters (the means can be incoherent, contradictory, inconsistent, even hypocritical), and in this case it's about how can we as a society control, limit or manage speech so that it frees the oppressed from the behavior."

"Free speech is only valuable when it serves Marxist interests. Remember that Marxism is a product line, and an especially unpopular poor quality ideological product line at that. Moving low-grade ideological product is much easier if you can silence the alternatives.  'As Marxists used to say, fascism 'appeals to the basest instincts,' implying that leftists were at a disadvantage because they could appeal only to noble instincts like envy of the rich. Since it is irrational, fascism is sadistic, nationalist, and racist by nature. Leftist regimes are also invariably sadistic, nationalist, and racist, but that's because of regrettable mistakes or pressure of difficult circumstances. Leftists want what's best but keep meeting unexpected setbacks, whereas fascists have chosen to commit evil.' http://www.la-articles.org.uk/fascism.htm  Marxism promotes a violent revolutionary war based on class identity. Why shouldn't it be banned as hate speech?"

"I thumbs-upped your video because you've taken a thoughtful approach and explicitly recognized that, for example, Dave Rubin isn't a Nazi.  My problem with the way the left uses terms like misogynist and islamaphobe (and most especially nazi) are used, is that they frequently ARE applied to people like Dave Rubin who aren't really any of those things, no matter what you might think of the selection of people they choose to interview. Additionally, I don't think random people in the audience have the right to disrupt an event for the people who attend. The noisy can shakers, the equipment destroyers, the chanters... none of them are doing something I consider reasonable. Especially when they do it to someone like Dave Rubin.  I used to identify with that side of the fence, but after seeing people lied about and 'deplatformed' over largely innocuous things that just happened to conflict with a certain narrow orthodoxy, I can't anymore. If you want those words to be granted power, stop using them at the drop of a hat."

"7:20 : The two cannot be equated. The consequence of unjustifiably accusing someone of racism or islamophobia is that they have to spend a considerable amount of time and energy to refute the claim and repair their reputation. The fact that any given ‚Äúmarginalized‚Äù person is discouraged from saying something because they are afraid of hearing counter arguments is not the same. It just means that they don‚Äôt have a spine. Their speech is not being suppressed."
"Having your public character (falsely) smeared as a racist is not the same as putting up with dumb troll misogynistic  shitlords who take the piss. This should be obvious really.  Similarly, Hitchens is against denying holocaust deniers free speech because of the legal or societal impact. If your life is ruined for speaking what you believe to be the truth that is different to not having the backbone to say what you believe. You're way off here."
"These videos are such an experience"
"i certainly haven't read/watched all of hitchens publications/videos/appearences/etc but i don't see why people have both diety-type adoration nor condemnation for him. when someone has the sort of celebrity as Hitchens, it is inevitable that he will fail to uphold everything he allegedly stood for or is perceived to have stood for. could you describe him as egotistical, prickish with a touch of elitism... yes; but you can't deny his ability of wordsmithing about issues of minority groups/religion whether he personally believes it is another matter. hitchens is like the arrogant, opinionated, uncouth, older brother of JPeterson who uses a lot of fluffed up, jargoned points & debating techniques to influence/push conservative political veiws. he doesn't apologise for being flawed, hide it or find the need to argue this point because that is a given for human kind. only those who deny that the intrinsic flaw exists in everything including us and therefore our concepts should be compelled to do so (EG: as religious people are prone to do). in no way is hitchens the best that we can be but he is far from the worst. to me he is just, real.. flawed, talented, everything inbetween and very aware & confident with it all. he's a talented wordsmith. (i edited this because i later realised that it read very differently to what was in my head). i do feel that ContraPoints is better & has evolved more, in positive ways, than hitchens."

"i disagree with so much of this so hard, but i'm a pretty crazy, humorless defender of the 1st.  but, the only point i've been trying to get out there in the current, batshit crazy, times we live in is that you can't both be anonymous and be associated with free-speech.  the point of that freedom is that there are realities and consequences to the things people say, and if you're putting a message into a bottle and throwing it into the internet that isn't speech because speech has 2 sides"
"Not too sure about 'right to a platform'. That seems like more of a positive right than the other interpretations of 'freedom of speech'. And yes, those are not clearly defined categories, but right to a platform is also poorly defined - it almost implies an obligation to listen to opinions, even if they seem stupid. If I have a right to interact with information I disagree with, why does that imply an obligation to listen to it?"

"This is why I don't pick a side. This is the reason I see the two sides as merely two sides of the same coin.

"You're creating a false dichotomy here when you try to construct any speech as exclusive of other speech.  That's not how it works.  No speech unavoidably enjoins the speech of anybody else unless you're literally shouting it through a bullhorn to drown the other person out.  You're basically equating action with effect here.  An effect of allowing dipshits to yodel hate speech into the collective butthole of humanity can be the dissuasion of more marginalized groups from speaking, but that's not the action.  That's the side effect, and it's one that can easily be dismissed if the marginalized people......well.....just ignore it.  You're living proof of that.  I will agree that marginalized people have to be braver than folks in the majority when it comes to voicing their position, but that's precisely why you apply an amplifying effect.  The question here is one of principle - do you better safeguard free speech by supporting the contribution of marginalized people or by forcibly restricting the contribution of those who would marginalize them.  Those really are mutually exclusive approaches, and only one of them comports with the principle of universally free speech.  Morons who complain about the fact that they can't get a venue on a college campus to talk bullshit are obviously being dramatic idiots, but they're not wrong that the act of declining them an otherwise available opportunity does not comply with the principle of freedom of speech.  tl;dr - There's a perfectly valid discussion to be had about whether the solution to increasing the visibility of marginalized groups' speech is a gag or a bullhorn that you're fallaciously dismissing by way of a false dichotomy."
"is that the Koran behind you on the piano?"
"I respect your views, however, I think you made one big mistake here.  You are confusing private business, organisations, and privately organized events  with public areas, and public platforms."
"You're pretty good at this (and I'm talking to you by the way. 2, 237 people have already commented here, and no one is going to read my contribution) but this video you've posted here about this specific subject falls a bit short of your usual standard of quality (lighting and costume aside).  Of course, and you know why this is first, Hitchens-  It's a good idea to understand your beliefs from more than just the single perspective of always having them validated. Let's get contrary points of view on stage to see how the actually operate. We might just learn something about our own views in the process. Given that you're usually really, really good at this, I'm going to have to assume that there's something else at work here for you to represent that red-cheeked, chubby little guest speaker so poorly. Hitchens was the invited speaker. If he didn't want a person interrupting him during that one speech, then that's strikingly different than a crowd descending on a building to silence someone else's invited guest.   And now, the kitchen. Yep, maybe you should just get the hell out, but that's not the actual problem with your argument. You made a really basic false equivalency between a room full of ideological women grumbling at your perspective, and the physical blocking of people from speaking. First off, a person who made such a good video on how the left is doing such a disservice to itself by behaving so unreasonably must understand how this type of behavior serves to fuel all the nonsense that's rising up again out of the graves of World War II. 'Academia's just like that'? Not a reasonable comparison. So I could condescend to you and tell you how most of your videos I've watched have been well-reasoned, whether or not I agree with them, or I could just point out that you fucked this one up pretty structurally in the first half. So if you adopt a sophisticated (what a word) view of free speech, you have to acknowledge that blocking entrances, banging on windows, and pulling fire alarms is a bit different than calling someone a degenerate on a comment section."
"I realize I'm late to the party, I only recently got turned onto Contrapoints. You make some solid points about the inherent limitations of free speech and just how free it can be, but I have to say that this video comes off as a little disingenuous- choosing edge cases like milo is a real straw man argument to be making. Firstly, conflating everything Milo says into one massive category of hate speech is an over exaggeration, as he occasionally has a halfway decent point, even if it is embedded in rhetorically flamboyant and inflammatory language. There are plenty of conservative speakers have faced the exact same degree of harassment and attempts to de-platform them as Milo- Peterson and Shapiro are two that immediately come to mind, and everyone should be able to agree that they aren't spouters of hate speech. The fact that these people have been subject to attempts from students on the left to intimidate, drown out with noise, and force the administration to withdraw their invitations has gone completely unanswered in this video. I disagree with some of their points, often in the same vein as you do in other videos, and I don't see you defending their right to speak, their right to not be shouted down by the very very vocal left.  Second, you acknowledge that one of the points of speech is that it allows the audience to reevaluate their own views- to understand and reflect on how they 'know' things. In this particular context, Milo's speech can be a great starting off point for talking some of the crazies down from their ideological ledges. But that simply cannot happen if you try to remove his platform- you simply amplify his voice and reach, which you acknowledge happens, but still advocate for it?! Dissecting your argument, it seems filled with this kind of hypocrisy. Is your goal to be right, or to persuade people to your point of view? I ask because telling people that Milo is someone who spews hate speech and that you are trying to protect people from him by not allowing him to speak is taking the same kind of moralizing high road that caused people to reject Hilary and vote for Trump. Is it not better to simply allow him his time in the sun, then host an event right before or after, in which you have your platform demolish his arguments/P.O.V? This way, you protect free speech, without giving conservatives ammunition... Hilary and her 'Deplorables' comment is doing the exact same thing as you implicitly do here- turning a debate about people's freedom to have a different opinion from those on the left into a 'We're righteous, and you're morally bankrupt' argument... And if you believe protecting his ability to say hate speech is unacceptable because of the potential damage to vulnerable minorities that would come from some hypothetical implied 'endorsement' that protecting his speech would provide, well, there's a whole raft of arguments and examples I or anyone can provide for why that's a bad idea. I appreciate Peterson's view which he states in the Cathy Newman interview talking about peoples 'right to not be offended'- if you focus on this, it becomes a race to the bottom to see who can be the most offended in order to count the most coup in this era of hyper-identity politics.    Your implied claim that protecting his right to give a talk after being invited to a campus to speak necessarily indicates a value judgement as to what is more worthy to protect feels wrong considering that the majority of speakers on college campuses are almost always on the left of the political spectrum. College environments at this point are clearly hostile to almost all conservative viewpoints- doesn't this mean that speakers like Milo SHOULD receive 'special protections'? (I do like the admission that it's 'No one is perfectly consistent when it comes to protecting the speech of people we disagree with, and it's impossible to be perfectly consistent because...' I find it ironic that you admit you want to deplatform richard spenser- considering your title and rejection of that premise...) Basically, you create a false dilemma where the today's unpopular speech MUST be shut down because allowing it must mean that it silences others. Saying that you notice what kinds of speech that the conservatives like Peterson(I know you don't specifically call him out in that part of your speech, but you don't acknowledge the nuance of his argument ever either...) aren't vocal in defending, ergo racism/transphobia, is one hell of a slippery slope. He has explicitly said that what he's against is COMPELLED speech. Because this is something that has NEVER been done before- the law actually compelling specific speech. He's said hes perfectly happy calling people by their preferred pronouns depending on the circumstances(zhe and zher is unwieldy, so why use them? It's not a natural evolution of language because of how unwieldy/artificial they are...). However, you skip over arguments like this in your haste to... be right?  All that said, I don't completely disagree with you, but I've seen a number of your other videos, and this one just really feels like a gut reaction in search of supporting evidence. It certainly isn't as nuanced as I had come to expect from your usually more thoughtful and rounded videos. Basically, I get vibes of Sherlock, 'Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.'  TLDR: The solution to speech you don't like is more speech, NOT shutting down the other side because you disagree or even find their argument morally repugnant. Pretending like the left isn't doing that, or that its OK because they are protecting the rights of minorities is a red herring."
"I want to see if my take away from this video is valid. So much awesome throughout. But there was one claim or conclusion that I took issue with--that if somebody is consistently against deplatforming on a social level, they should also advocate for rules & legislation (like the kind Jordan Peterson fights against) since it will encourage more people to speak their minds. I don't want to misrepresent the video, so correct me if I heard it wrong, but there's a BIG disconnect there."

"Heh, the whole thing about women not wanting to make videos... Yeah. I've had a few guy friends suggest I start streaming (because I'm a gamer and most of them find me both funny and a good player). My response is a resounding 'no' because I don't want to deal with the misogyny that inevitably seems to show up whenever a chick decides to play games. (I've been heavily gaming online for ten years. I'm not imagining a problem, I've encountered it on a regular basis. It typically is very different than your standard gamer trolling, which is usually something I'm not even bothered by.)  So, it's not even about women making videos about feminism or sexism, or whatever. It's a problem, in general. The fact that Lindsay Ellis gets bullshit on occasion when almost all of her content is just about film theory and critical analysis (as opposed to say, 'Does this movie pass the Bechdel test?' or 'How problematic is this movie when it comes to women?' etc) is just.. stupid."
"I very like christopher hitchens. Thank you for criticizing him in the correct way."
"Regarding hate speech, the concerns I always hear raised are not 'muh but muh feelz r hurt when they call me racist', and more concerns regarding Laws being created which limit hate speech, as well as the privately owned means of communication employed nowadays (internet forums, social media sites, etc) limiting what they consider 'hateful' and thus enabling a de facto limitation on what can be said, a silencing of certain viewpoints.  At that point it's not a matter of 'can't take the heat', it's a matter of 'can't be heard, because the means of communication are being actively disabled'.  This is potentially problematic due to the lack of viable alternatives, especially 'public' ones wherein free speech is actually recognized as a priority.  Imagine if the US postal office read all mail being transmitted, and shut down mail sending privileges for anyone who sent something they deemed to be 'problematic'; or if phone companies (landline, cell, whatever) read all content transmitted across their networks, and shut down phone calling / texting privileges for those they considered to be a problem.  It would be difficult to argue that such actions would be free speech violations, or at minimum impose a de facto limitation upon free speech.  When twitter and facebook have no public counterparts free of their ability to as a private entity determine what kind of speech they consider acceptable, does the fact that it's happening on the behalf of a private company, and thus not actually illegal, mitigate in any way the fact that it is, in fact, limiting free speech?  If instead all of those companies were owned by religious right folks, who were banning anyone with viewpoints they found distasteful, would you consider it problematic then?  Your contention that some forms of speech dampen others is based upon your premise (with which I do not agree) that the contention on the right is that it is 'social pressures' which prevent them from speaking, and not 'deplatforming', or the denial of any venue in which communication can occur.  Certainly it can be said that concerns about being fired for saying something which your employer disagrees with while off the clock is also valid, but again, that's not 'social pressure'.  Imagine too that were reversed- that you went to a club, posted it to instagram, and your employer took offense to it and fired you because you did not match their 'values'.  Still, the root issue here is Not one of 'social pressure' and thus I reject your supposition that you must 'choose a side'.  That, in fact, seems to be against the very idea of free speech.  By contending that allowing someone to say something that will hurt the feelings of another is in fact somehow limiting the free speech of someone else, it's a raw, unabashed, justification for the prevention of free speech in the first place.  In fact, it's outright promoting the idea that 'some views are more worth protecting than others' (ie, those that I agree with), and thus promoting mob silencing of unpopular opinions.  As to how 'hateful speech' silences others, I'll be clear- I just disagree.  I 100% disagree with the Premise that Speech, in and of itself, no matter how hateful it is, actually Prevents others from speaking.  Regardless of how much more Difficult it may make it for them, or how much more often they may make the Choice to not speak out, it is still a CHOICE.  Nothing, inherently, about the speech of others prevents you from speaking yourself.  That's what freedom of speech Means.  When someone says something bigoted, ignorant, or racist, I would consider it the Duty of others to speak out in turn and present better ideas, but I reject the very premise that the mere existence of hateful attitudes presents an impassable barrier to them doing so.  To be clear as well:  I will defend, passionately, the right of Anyone to free speech, not just including but Especially those I disagree with.  Please provide me with an example of someone on the left having their free speech Actually Impinged, and not just by others saying things with which they disagree or which causes them offense.  I mean an actual Limitation on what they are able to say, whether de jure or de facto, and I will be happy to look further into it, and I will 100% support their right.  It is not just the right whose free speech I passionately defend- we simply disagree on what an impingement upon free speech actually looks like.  Yes, I would tell folks to 'take the abuse and get over it', and I would tell that to the left and right alike.  If you say that someone merely saying something that causes someone else offense is adequate reason to prevent that thing from being said, which is your entire premise, then you don't truly have free speech at all, as at that point anything that someone disagrees with they can simply claim offends them and is somehow hateful, and use that as justification to prevent them from being able to speak at all, and that's not free speech.    Honestly I can't speak for the left, but the conclusion I draw from this is that You do not believe in free speech."
"How does disregarding a trans person's gender cause a silencing effect? I think people SHOULD acknowledge it, to be clear, I just don't understand how that has a silencing effect. If someone misgenders you, do you suddenly feel the urge to not speak? How is that related to this issue?  I agree that it would pressure trans people to stay out of the workforce but I don't understand how misgendering or disparaging gender would have a SILENCING effect on trans people."
"Contra, you are taking the Hitch quote at 10:13 completely out of context, listen to what he says before and after that clip."
"Being insulted because you're making a Youtube video as a trans or gay person is really not nice, but it cannot silence you. But there is a difference between that and say being accused of racism at a university. This can lead to you losing your job and possibly destroy your entire career if you cannot prove the claims are false. There have also been cases of protesters shutting down lectures being given by teachers who've been accused of racism (like in the case of Eric Weinstein, a fellow Leftist).  I fucking love your videos, Contra, but believe it or not it isn't just people on the Right who are sick of identity politics. I'm a Chomsky reading, Bernie loving, tree snuggling snowflake (take those left wing credentials) but I too partake of the opinion that identity politics are a simply unconstructive way of dealing with inequality and social injustice.  It isn't that I want people to be able to hurl abuse at transgender people or homosexuals or women; it's that shouting down anyone who says the wrong word or espouses the wrong opinion as being racist or transphobic is about the worst possible way you could go about bringing people over to your way of thinking.  Contrapoints doesn't do this, which is great, but many people do and I think it's our duty to be critical of the aspects of the Left that would seek to shut down debate with those on the Right in stead of challenging their ideas head on."

"I really doubt anyone is saying their speech is suppressed by someone saying the word racist, it's suppressed because a bunch of people actually think they're racist, and they deplatform them with the threat of violence, actual violence, or obnoxious loud protests that make any monologue or discussion impossible. The people you mention whose speech on Youtube is supposedly suppressed, are not deplatformed. They could speak and they could be heard, but they choose not to.  8:17 I don't believe such a 'contradictory situation' exists. Give me an example of when you can't protect booth a woman's speech and that of a misogynist? Or or when you can't protect that of an ethnic minority or those with a negative view of said minority? Why does hateful speech suppress other speech? The answer can't be someone saying 'Women/Homosexuals/Ethnic Minorities shouldn't be allowed to voice their opinions!', because you can simply point to the law and say 'Sorry Mr. Spencer, this says they are allowed to, go fuck yourself.'.  You seem to be deliberately conflating things to create 'sides'."

"This is the second video of yours I watched. Your views are interesting but your misrepresentation of peoples' arguments is a huge turn off.  A bit of rhetorical advice I've unashamedly stole from a more eloquent speaker: You should do your best to frame the opposing argument in as strong of a manner as possible, so when you ultimately deconstruct it and present your (presumably) better way of looking at things, it's a more impressive and compelling feat.  When you misrepresent the people whom you're presenting yourself against, you only serve to weaken your own stance. At least, that's how it's worked out in my own experience."

"I think free speech should be protected for everyone, there shouldn‚Äôt be any double standards. However, a silencing effect can‚Äôt be treated the same as actual silence. Even if a hostile atmosphere is formed, whether on college campuses or on Twitter, for lefties or righties, people will still have the freedom to speak within that hostile atmosphere. In fact, open opinions allow for more accurate representation of beliefs to be countered. If people openly admit they are fascists, the people in the Center will stay further away from them. That happened to me with some conservative YouTubers who originally sounded rational but turned out to be western chauvinists when they exercised free speech."
"I can understand why people enjoy Peterson, Harris, the late Hitchens, etc.  They are/were talented sophists.  I don't understand how anyone can listen to Dave Rubin for more than 10 consecutive seconds."
"The main evidence is that the left does not like freedom of speech to lie on the surface. All existing socialist states completely control social media and control the opinions of people in every possible way. Left movements are the first who try to push through the government new norms of regulation over the utterances of people."
"6:22 What about prohibitions by service providers (e.g. domain name registrars, search engines, social media, or even printing services)? It's different than a typical institutional prohibition since service providers aren't physical locations that can easily be avoided and de-platforming by service providers can be extremely burdensome. Being de-listed by Google isn't meaningfully different from a law banning that content from appearing on any search engine."

"Dave Rubin, like many other self-styled defenders of free speech, is a tribalistic, intellectually dishonest hack who is more comfortable talking to bigots and crackpots than ordinary, run-of-the-mill progressives. But the so-called ‚Äúregressive left‚Äù is, in fact, a real thing, and it is, in fact, a threat to free speech. If you deny that, you are likely a tribalistic, intellectually dishonest hack yourself."
"There seems to be a lack of acknowledgment that being labeled racist, sexist, bigot, or what have you, carries a heavy social cost. This cost is not one that is perceived but has been demonstrated.   While I don't think the Left hates free speech, but certain elements within the Left certainly do want to be in control of what is allowed to be said. While I feel that certain things might need to be policed, or at the very least reigned in, we must be cautious as to who is allowed to judge what is and isn't allowed. Already, any such the control is direct conflict with what free speech is all about."

"12:44 -13:00  -> I don't think you represented that properly... The 9-11 truthers do have a right to have a platform, but they DO NOT have the right to invade his platform because they happen to be the opposing view.  See what i'm saying?  You can have a platform for anything, but you can't invade someone elses platform just because you disagree. So, for example, if you go to a racist event you can't hold a 'civil debate' with them there. That's not what that event is for. In an event like that, the only thing you can do is listen and ask questions if they permit it.  In order to debate them,you would have to go to an event specifically for a debate on that subject. Hopefully that makes sense... Good job anyways Contra."

"'Do you want to defend the speech of misogynists or the speech of women?'    For some reason it bothers me when language uses generalizations for the sake of simplicity to the point where it becomes inaccurate.  Probably because it reinforces the overarching notions people have of certain words.  Obviously you're aware that many women are misogynistic and transmit these ideas to others: like my aunt for example who would never vote for a female politician because 'women don't make as good of leaders' or my mother who would rather not have a female surgeon operate on her because 'women are more emotional and something like the surgeon's man leaving her could affect her ability to operate well that day'.  Sure, I could just be like 'it's ok, I get what you mean' but using 'women' in a way that implies every woman fits into that category gives more strength to the word in terms of people thinking that they can infer more from that term than they ought to."
"I find Contrapoints a really interesting YouTuber, and it's interesting to finally see someone support the Left as well as progressivism without being this moral arbitor without any viable means of argumentation and tribalist vigor, Contrapoints wants to address PEOPLE. The format is also as entertaining as the better parts of the Skeptic community and anti-SJW's. Looking forward to seeing more REAL discourse from people in both camps."
"Well, there is difference between internet and academia right? Like, different purpose and history. Academia was always seeking truth right? And for that you need to hear different views as a form of realty check and stuff. And internet is wild west that is here for million different purposes. That is why I don't agree with that argument you made about 'just dealing with it'.   Also, you make an argument that Dave people don't attack people who attack women etc. and in that way restrict their free speech. Well, really small amount of people truly are racist etc so in a way they are protected (and bad guys are attacked) regulary (how to fucking spell this word?? reee :D ) so no need for more of that. And people who are 'dark intellectuals' are attacked all the time, even by mass media and people in academia. The second someone say something horrible on basis of their race or gender, they get fired etc. But nobody is getting fired because of calling someone else racist for no real reason. Maybe the reason they are attacked is even something else...  I don't mean that people who say racist shit are correct in doing so.   Sorry for bad english. USA politics is fun to watch even if you are outsider like me :D   I just discovered your channel and you obviously put a lot of effort into making them. Also, you make smart arguments. You prove to me that  Hitchens is hypocrite on this subject. And even tho I don't agree with you at all, I enjoy your video very much. It was entertaining. Subbed.  Edit: I would also love to see some of your debates, gonna check is there any at you channel etc"
"Everyone wants free speech for themselves, but nobody wants others to have the free speech for calling out their bullshit. That's pretty much the whole of it."
"In my view you've gotten this wrong because you've framed it in the context of bad arguments and hypocrisy coming from right wingers.  You're argument relies on this claim you make at 7:20ish that some speech is so offensive that it can have a silencing effect on others, and that this means that one persons free speech necessarily comes at the expense of another.  In practice this elevates the freedom not to have your feelings hurt over another persons freedom of speech.  If offense is the limit of free speech then we might as well just scrap the concept all together, because people can and do claim offense at everything.  I would argue the speech most worthy of protection is necessarily going to offend someone.  If   Furthermore there is an argument about how deep free speech protections should penetrate in to other institutions like universities and workplaces, and I would expect you of all people to agree with me that the penetration must be deep.  If freedom of speech only grants you the freedom to be fired when your employer (including, perhaps especially universities) doesn't like something you've said, that is no freedom at all."

"(6 min 50ish) im pretty sure the problem isn't with being called a racist but with the connotations it comes with, classical/social liberal viewpoints can get you kicked out of the uni and more, they can literally have enforcement from law. Whereas all the other things you described are very easy to deal with. Not only that but when unis call you a racist the general public believes them, and god forbid the media gets a hold of it, whereas a feminist activist who is being 'silenced by the pressure of words' would be scooped up and martyred by the media. But thas jussa take, a hooot take!"
"Thanks  ! I hadn‚Äôt realised what a big fat KKKUNT Hitchens was !"
"You look like a young Brian Eno."
"Like, see, the problem with your analysis unfortunately suffers from the same lack of establishing a well understood common ground like so many other demons in sheep skin. If I may.  You posit from the beginning, that, essentially, all 'noises' that protrude from a person's facial opening must necessarily be considered 'Speech'. So when a woman moans from getting fucked by mandigo, that's her giving her 'Speech'. Or when the homeless bum across the street finally finished whacking off in your shoes, that sounds he makes during release, or hell, during masterbation, are also under your definition of 'Speech'.  You implicitly classify just about ANYTHING a person can do.....as 'Free Speech'.  This is about as mature, and well-defined an understanding as 13 year old Atheists have of religion. That is to say, well, I'm sure you know.  But hey, I don't wanna burst your bubble here so feel free to delete my comments or whatever you want. I could personally care less. I'm far more interested in seeing if you possess the capability to smell the rank of your own shit.  I ain't holdin my breath...."
"Are you saying that pretty much everyone is just using free speech as an excuse to get their favorite ideas out? In effect, there are no true free speech advocates?"

"You speak Mandarin? Or did you just learn some phrases for the bits? Either way, you got good tone chops."

"There are a minority of left and right wingers who try to shut down any speech they dislike."
"If I understand correctly, you are saying that if you defend the rights of bigots to express hateful opinions over protecting the marginalized groups who feel limited in their chances to express themselves because of all the hateful shit they will be confronted with, you are basically on the side of the hateful and you are not defending free speech but your own covertly held believes? I find that a bit of a manipulative rhetoric trick. 'You refuse to to set limitations to protect me from hateful speech and therefore you must have hateful views yourself'. It's a more subtle way to avoid addressing the person's arguments for free speech by diverting attention to the implications this has about a person. Now, I agree, being called a racist is not a limitation of free speech. I just think it's intellectually lazy. I do agree also that more platform should be given to the marginalized groups. Maybe YouTube is for many as you mentioned still a bit too scary place for that, so cable network would be a good start, where at least people are not directly confronted with the file reactions. The whole free speech debate at least in my country got problematic and hijacked by the right when a columnist got slaughtered by a extremist for showing Koran texts on a naked female body. This brought about a big islamophobic reaction. The left, never faced with this mixed loalty ( protecting minorities versus freedom from religious oppression) suggested that this kind of escalation might be prevented in the future if we treat the religious believes of minority groups with respect. Viola, there was the right claiming freedom of speech against the tiranny of Islam. And so the narrative shifted.    If you are for freedom of speech nowadays you are automatically boxed as right wing, if you are suggesting any civility in the discourse you are considered a lefty traitor. I suppose it's good we are having a renewed debate about the meaning and function of freedom of speech. By the way, I love your work. I don't always agree with your viewpoints but I will defend your rights to express them until I have something better to do."
"I love your pentacle wall hanging ^^"
"Free speach is the right not to be agrresed due to your expression.  Agression is the use or threat of violence and fraud.   You dont have to listen to someone."
"You lost me at.  Needing to find out 'Which speakers are truly marginalized  and in need of protection '    No we don't.   Everyone's speech.  No need to find out anything.    But you are definitely  correct about people not remaining consistent when dealing with some they disagree with.   That's something we all need to work on.    Much like the 'microaggression' used in the reversing of the'can't handle the fire' arguement in the  'being called a racist on campus' example.  People are cool with breaking  their own rules all the time."
"Yep, is left time to hate freedom of speech. In the same vein, early 1990's was the moment of the right. The pendulum always swing."
"Wow, never heard Hitchens beating on minorities like that. It kinda hurts actually. I feel some sympathy for the Christians."
"I like this video a lot, it makes thought-provoking points, but it really misrepresents Hitchens - I know that Contrapoints already acknowledged in a pinned comment that they (sorry, pronoun unknown) took the 'fags, wretched women etc.' bit out of context, but it's really important to understand that this is just his rhetorical style - he's doing several things at once: 1) adopting the language of the religious people with whom he disagrees, and who would use hate speech laws to defend their right to endorse bigotry; 2) using deliberately shocking language in order to engage the audience; 3) demonstrating his contempt for the very idea that certain words might be considered illegal, no matter how offensive.   Although I won't pretend that he hasn't said some controversial things (particularly about gender roles), he cannot with any degree of intellectual honesty be accused of being homophobic, anti-Semitic or racist. In particular he spent a great deal of time thinking about and defending the rights of homosexuals - one of my favorite examples here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VOuVqx2uM8  My problem with the idea that you can't adopt a neutral attitude towards free speech is that it's simply not true - you can allow that all views have an equal right to be expressed. That doesn't mean that you give all views equal urgency in all times and places, but in a context where (as in Hitchens' argument in this video) the right to criticize religion is under threat, then it isn't the free expression of minorities which needs defending, but the free expression of everyone else. In other circumstances - for example the context in which Mill was writing On Liberty - it might be the right to free expression of (for example) religious minorities which needs defending. The commitment to free expression remains consistent throughout, but the context of the argument will necessarily shape where the emphasis is placed.  Nor do I accept the view that by defending the rights of bigots to speak you implicitly adopt or endorse their position - it is perfectly possible to support a person's right to say something in one instance, and condemn what they said in the next - indeed, the only way you can possibly condemn someone's position is if they've expressed it. Hitchens stated elsewhere his concern for the actual content of Irving's antisemitism and conspiracy thinking, but that didn't stop him from saying that he nevertheless ought to be able to say it. It's not a question of 'sides'. Also if you believe that by repressing bigoted speech you actually fuel more bigotry (as many people do), then you'll defend the free speech of bigots on precisely the grounds that you ARE NOT on their side.  Also, that video where he has the truther thrown out... yeah, not his finest hour. But just because Hitchens was inconsistent, it doesn't follow that everyone else should be, even if we'll inevitably trip up on occasion on account of human fallibility."
"I'm afraid I must object to you referring to the likes of Ruben and Peterson by the moniker 'Classical Liberal,' despite it being their preferred appellation. The true Classical Liberals were much more sophisticated and respectable than their lot. The only modern thinkers really worthy of the name Classical Liberals are the Georgists. They are the only ones who recognize the importance of the Lockean Proviso and still seek to promote true free markets rather than protecting the privileges of the class to whom the state has given the power to deny their fellow humans their common right to equal access to nature unless they pay them rack rents."

"Ok, part 1 was exclusively a _tu quoque_ towards one person. Let's see if part 2 has any actual points."
"Here is an observation. I 'came out' in 1989 as bisexual after being rejected by the military for a linguist position. I was 17 years old. I then experienced a great deal of hatred from homophobic people in the town I grew up in. I left. I was accepted to an art school but was also banned from an LGB organization for not merely calling myself bisexual but actually having sex with the opposite gender and was literally ridiculed by dozens of gay men on campus. I still had a couple of gay friends afterwards. I curated at a theater and included gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender performers and worked for a more inclusive world. Little did I know that the mainstream gay movement was going to continue its propaganda campaign against anyone who called themselves bisexual or claimed to have attraction to both genders. And in the years 2000's the scenario got worse and worse. I was harassed illegally in graduate school, and at several jobs. In graduate school it got so bad the faculty intervened.  Then I started researching the problem.  'How is it that the gay movement has held onto the delusion that bisexual men and women don't exist?'  I came up with multiple answers. One is that in the early gay movement needed to control the narrative and anything that made the narrative too complicated or had blurry boundaries needed to be erased. Eventually it resulted in illegal harassment and discrimination of bisexual people.  By 2010 this prejudice was completely intolerable for me and many others and so bisexual men and women as a group began suing and winning and threatening gay and lesbian organizations with lawsuits. Ironically today the mainstream gay movement prefers saying 'gay and transgender' and still ignores the bisexual population. What has changed is a recognition of the existence of bisexual individuals.  The above is to illustrate how a marginal group can engage in decades of discrimination, harassment, controlled narratives, and delusional contradictory world views.  There was in fact another way to progress LGBT rights. That of protecting and advocating the right to love whom one wants to all human beings. But this would be a classical liberal and social liberal perspective that is based on broader human rights principles rather than myopic identity politics and framing the idea of 'the gay man' as a species as Foucault put it.  The problem is however is when transgender and bisexual activists question conservative gay pundits like Andrew Sullivan they were routinely silenced. It is clear that the gay mainstream has followed a path that benefited those in power."
"This is incredibly dumb.  Speech has to be free, period. The pitfalls and errors that people like Hitchens may have done are no excuse. They are wrong when they deny speech of people they do not like.  And that is the why free speech must be defended. The moment you deny speech to your enemy is the moment no speech is safe, even my own."
"If you are scared to speak that's your problem. No-one is silencing you and if you speak up no-one will hurt you (physically). If that does happen however, then that person is in the wrong because your right to free speech was violated. That's the whole point of free speech. If you are scared to speak up, that's your problem. Should you feel scared to speak up? No, why would you? Because others will not like you or something? This video puts things out of context (the example provided though is legitimate)."
"You can just debunk a holocaust denier easily. There is no need to de-platform them."
"DID YOU ROOFIE RUBIN?!"
"I think Mill's response is eloquent: ‚ÄúThere is the greatest difference between presuming an opinion to be true, because, with every opportunity for contesting it, it has not been refuted, and assuming its truth for the purpose of not permitting its refutation. Complete liberty of contradicting and disproving our opinion is the very condition which justifies us in assuming its truth for purposes of action; and on no other terms can a being with human faculties have any rational assurance of being right.‚Äù  How can we know that something is true without debating it rigorously? If you hinder speech against minorities and prevent bigots from expressing their point of view, you lose the basis for which you justify your censorship in the first place. Similarly, bigots ought not say things that discourage minorities from speaking.   To do otherwise would be to rob everyone of their right to know the truth.  To me it seems censorship seems irrational - whether performed by a government, institution or group of people. I think ContraPoints creates a false dilemma when she says that we need to choose sides on the issue of hate speech."
"But by protecting the right of those groups not to be offended, autistic people are silenced.  They don't know when they are going to accidentally offend someone so they might be afraid to speak at all."

You seem pretty adamant there is a connection between an individual‚Äôs allowances of ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù and the kind of person they are.

You can't deny the speaker's right without also denying the right of the audience, in which case you're a tyrannical authoritarian lunatic who needs to be stopped, and that's especially true if we're talking about a 'government' that thinks it knows best. So curtailing speech in law certainly isn't a good idea. Putting informal social boundaries on acceptable speech is a better idea, because those are easily mutable."

It's not that some ideas or people need special considerations, it's that non-controversial speech doesn't require laws protecting it because it's not under threat of censorship in the first place. Where we actually need to defend free speech is when it comes to people or ideas that are distasteful. The problem across the west we have right now is the gangs of radical left wing authoritarians on campuses who no-platform right wing speakers because they consider their ideas as 'hate speech'. Basically means ideas they cannot tolerate are not allowed and what that does is shut down political discourse and polarizes the political landscape. There's constant examples of that over the last few years, how these groups have essentially taken over the universities especially in the US and often through the violence of antifa and similar groups, have made having peaceful events.  Freedom of speech necessarily cannot rely on the sensitivities of individuals because some individuals are arbitrarily sensitive to basically any discourse. Y'know, these people who need a safe space with toys in it to go and sit because someone drew trump slogans in chalk around their campus and they're literally shaking because of it, and that's not a joke or exaggeration, that really happened.  So this conflict you state where some speech necessarily denies other peoples speech really isn't a problem. If you're someone who doesn't have the fortitude to hear other peoples speech and/or stand up and voice yourself, then that's something you actually have to work on yourself. And guess what, the generally accepted clinical practice for this is exposure therapy, where you voluntarily expose yourself to more of the things you can't tolerate, until you are able to tolerate them. And safe spaces are literally the opposite of this, they make you less able to cope in future.  If the left continue down this path it'll blow up in their face because it's polarizing politics and that's how you lead to radical groups like the alt right to fight back and that's why we see clashes with antifa, if this because the norm to shut down speakers by threatening violence and physically disrupting talks then it'll start happening to left wing speakers too. And defending it and pretending that it's acceptable in order to push a left wing narrative is making the situation worse. More to the point, it's just downright intellectually dishonest, and it largely comes down to not being able to defend your ideas outside of the echo chamber you learned them in."

"'if you're in favour of free speech, that means you're in favour of freedom of speech precisely for views you despise' - Chomsky"
"There is a fine line between 'extra protection of rights' and 'extra rights'. The more a person's rights are threatened, the more intervention will be needed to protect them, but those interventions must not violate the rights of others. Everyone's right to speak can be protected without conflict. This may entail e.g. defending the speaker from an angry mob, but it does not entail giving them a 'platform' or 'amplifying' their speech, and I don't think Rubin, Hitchens, or Mill would suggest that it does. None of the quotations you presented make that claim.  The argument against accusations of racism and *phobia is not that they violate anyone's rights, but that they are intellectually regressive. Criticizing ideas brings us closer to shared truth, criticizing people obscures it. If people are indeed intimidated into silence by the expression of false ideas (which I've seen little evidence of), then attacking the bad ideas is the best way to marginalize them, and embolden those silenced. Regardless, intimidation into silence cannot be the solution to intimidation into silence. Hopefully you can see why that approach is necessarily unstable."

"At around 9:40, you brought up a good point, that everyone is up in arms over this fear of being silenced with (often false or hyperbolic) claims of Islamophobia, homophobia, etc. I myself have fallen victim to this type of attack when discussing the concept of rape culture. I believe this happens because that fight has generally been won, both legally and in the hearts and minds of the public. People know these things are wrong, and are more likely to call them out in isolated incidents, and the rarity of such bigotry makes a workplace filled with racists or sexists extremely uncommon, though I'm sure it still does happen. For isolated incidents (or persistent individuals), there are also myriad avenues for handling it: going to Human Resources or a supervisor in the workplace (or the EEOC if it's a higher-up), going to a teacher or administrator in education, or calling the police in most other environments. Finding a new job or school is also an option, though that should be treated as a last resort and is technically (though less practical) an option with leftist label censorship as well. But if you're called a misogynist and the label sticks, it's a lot harder to deal with. Rape and pedophilia are the two most severe examples, capable of ending one's career even if you're never officially convicted of anything. I believe this is the main reason why Milo, Dave, Peterson, and so many others are much more focused on the Left like they are. I would also highlight the fact that the Left is already searching for such bigotry with a zealous passion. There isn't as much need for it to be focused down by Dave and the crowd, given that those in power are already on it."
"I think it's a false dilemma to suggest the free speech can suppress or deplatform other free speech.  I think people need to be able to speak openly about their beliefs, because their beliefs are held whether they speak them or not, which means a person will be influenced by racism and target others through their actions (actions typically being more important than words) whether or not they speak openly about their racism.  Allowing racists to speak openly a.)helps us find who the racists are and b.)encourages them to openly discuss with others, who will have opportunities to criticize and influence.  For this reason I think it is actually to the detriment of the targets of racism to label, silence, and alienate racists. They just go underground, create their own echo chambers, and see their alienation as justification for their beliefs.  So far my general direction of befriending the bigots around me has allowed me to influence them, and they have changed quite a lot with a few discussions and some maturity. I think it's OK to talk about an idea being racist, but just yelling 'racist asshole!' at a stranger just makes them feel justified. I wouldn't give a shit what someone thinks if they just called me an asshole, either."

"Two flaws in your argument:  1. You've set up a false dichotomy between protecting the speech of Natsees and the speech of ethnic/religious minorities. It is possible to protect both types of speech simply by enforcing already existing laws against threats of or actual violence. If someone feels intimidated by someone else's opinions, that's really their problem.  2. You cannot assume that the only reason someone doesn't protect the speech of minorities is because they secretly want to silence them. It is possible and likely that those people simply feel that such speech doesn't need protection because current laws are sufficient for that purpose."
"Freedom is a state of mind, that simple."
"I don't think there should ever be many legal restrictions on free speech. That said, freedom of speech does not protect you from the consequences of your speech."
"As for your argument against Hitchens, I don't give a shit.  I will now attack (and ruthlessly destroy) the base of your argument: 4:44 'The idea that we should protect and perhaps even amplify certain minority viewpoints...' No.  No.  No.  See, you leftists have always had this make-believe hierarchical victimhood based system, whereby the value of your opinion is determined by your ethnicity, race, or sexual orientation.  I disagree with that, and instead posit that all men should have equal rights under the law. 6:43 Here, you claim that calling someone a racist is 'subtle.' No, not really.  Calling someone a racist is a deadly serious accusation that could ruin your career or your reputation for the rest of your life.  You and I both know that Leftists use this to slander and vilify just because they disagree with someone, instead of attacking the merits of a person's argument.  All of the times I've been called one of the 'isms' or 'ists' by a leftist, it was because I backed them into a philosophical corner, and that's all they had left.  You KNOW this.  You KNOW how this is used.  You also KNOW that this is ad hominem, and totally uncalled for.  Celebrities on the left do it.  Journalists on the left do it.  Congressmen on the left do it.  Don't play coy.  You're twisting the argument, and we both know it. 7:15 Here, you claim that people are being steered away from making videos due to their fear of the public reaction. Yes.  I can 100% agree with you that racist statements online are wrong, but that's it.  If I'm willing to concede that people on the Right sometimes say inappropriate and cruel things online, then let's examine how you strawmanned the argument by omitting how people on the Left tend to silence conservatives, such as ALSO SAYING RACIST THINGS ONLINE, smashing people in the face with bicycle locks, hitting them with bats, pulling the fire alarms during conservative events, blocking traffic to and from events, calling in fake bomb threats, physically blocking doors, vandalism, arson, theft, destruction of private property including personal vehicles, shouting down, stealing, rushing the stage and grabbing the microphone, unplugging or disabling the sound system, to name just a few.  Here recently, a Leftist belonging to a political party got a restraining order against the president of the opposing conservative party, just so he couldn't attend political functions and debates. These are real world, physical, and often violent methods to censor people, and are not even in the same realm as someone making a personal choice not to make a video because of their own personal feelings.  I'm sorry, but these things don't even begin to compare.  Your argument is further shot down when you consider that both sides say hateful things, online. 8:00 Here, again, you claim that all that's going on is 'being called a racist on college campuses, and yet you continue to ignore that there's FAR, FAR more going on than that. 8:30  You claim that it's literally impossible to protect everyone's speech equally. The Bill of Rights guarantees equal opportunity, not equal outcome.  You don't actively suppress one group so the slow guys can catch up. Here, you launch into a 'no true scottsman' argument using the 'black-or-white' fallacy such as 'mysigynists or women,' insinuating that men are ALWAYS misogynists and that women are ALWAYS the victim.  Then you say 'racists, or people of color,' insinuating that white people are always racist, and 'people of color' are always the victim.  This is basically your make-believe hierarchical system, again.  Certain groups are ALWAYS the victim, and so should ALWAYS be defended, even if they're wrong.  That makes your entire paragraph, here, inherently bigoted, by definition. 9:05 Here, you claim that Ruben never defends anyone 'marginalized' on the left. To that, I will exclaim to you that if you show me a tranny who's been smashed in the face with a bicycle lock like Eric Clanton did, I'll be right there, defending them.  So far, that's not the behavior of the right, though.  All of the violence and censorship is coming from the left, and YOU need to stop defending your team, just because they're YOUR TEAM, and instead defend right from wrong.  Pulling fire alarms to censor speech is wrong.  Saying mean things on the internet comes from both sides.  YOU don't have a real argument. 9:30  When you say 'a trans employee's identity being disparaged,' do you mean to say that the other employees refuse to be a part of their make-believe world, and instead choose to describe their own world how they feel most comfortable?  What makes you think that because someone is trans, their right to feel comfortable somehow outweighs the rights of normal people to feel just as comfortable?  Hmm?  How about we simply grant equal speech to all involved?  Would you suppose it's ethical to restrict the free speech of  fifty workers by forcing them to use made-up words that just so happen to make ONE employee feel more comfortable?  How does that satisfy the Bill of Rights for anybody but one person?  I've been called every name in the book, but I'm still going to stand up and defend those people's right to speech.  YOU, HOWEVER, WILL NOT, AND INSTEAD SEEK TO SILENCE THEM."

"This was a good video. My personal opinion is that everyone should be allowed to say what they want (as long as its not jate speech, whichs definition is a while nother topic). But just because they get the chance to speak does not mean they get freedom of consequence. If i gove someone a platform to speak (whether they have been marginalized or not, or think they are for that matter). I have full freedom of speech(and honestly duty if i have a platform) to call them out on there bs."
"Reading the comments and seeing everyone think that freedom of speech means freedom of access to a respected platform is just... what?  You can say whatever you want but it is no one's requirement to host, give space to, entertain, listen to or respect what you say, especially if that thing is destructive to them at an intrinsic level. Racism is intrinsically destructive. Homophobia is intrinsically destructive. Poc and queer folks are not required to participate in the self-destructive act of 'respecting' opinions that disrespect our intrinsic existence. Full stop. And if we and the folks who support us think an opinion is destructive, and don't want to give it a platform or any credence, we just don't have to, and to demand us to is, frankly, abusive.   People of colour, queer folks, trans folks, immigrants... these are groups that deeply understand that respecting their speech is optional, because disrespecting their speech is so normalised. But for some reason folks on the right and the left, it seems like they think everyone should be open to all the racist, homophobic and transphobic things out there, or at least boycott it silently and respectfully and placidly. That's bullshit. Some people's opinions do not deserve a platform, and they don't deserve anyone's respect, even if that person should have the right to say them without being punished under the law. Because when the left leaning students deplatformed Milo or Coulter, they left the stage, walked to their limousines and skeetered back to their safe spaces. The folks who deplatformed MLK or Malcolm X did it with bullets and sent them to the grave. When Milo comes to campus, folks show up with signs and bullhorns. When BLM has a peaceful protest, police show up with guns, chemical weapons and armoured vehicles. Who's really getting silenced politically?"
"I believe In free speech until it crosses over into hate speech and libel/slander. Hate speech would be direct incitements to violence and that's it. Libel/slander is unsubstantiated claims which would lead to violence and which need to be proven before being claimed. So when you claim people on the right should just deal with being called racist, I don't think that's just. If I was to claim you are a pedophile without proof, and got other people to believe it, there would be a strong chance that you would be attacked due to my libellous activity. Its the same with throwing accusations of racism. But have you ever seen anyone get in trouble for calling someone racist without proof? of course not, because the law will never protect people on the right, and is unequally enforced, with preferential treatment for certain groups (usually on the left of the spectrum). You always see  people  loosing their jobs and running into trouble for the slightest infringement on political correctness, and the right has been dealing with being called racist for the last 50 years! but we don't advocate for people loosing their job or changing the law like the left do. As the laws are already there, they are just not enforced."
"The portrait of Anita on the piano is priceless."
"7:56 - Not sure about this part, which I /think/ is critical to your entire argument... Classically liberal free speech advocates DO have to just deal with being called racist, transphobic, sexist etc. on college campuses simply because they defend the rights of others to say racist, transphobic or sexist things, without ever necessarily having voiced any of their own opinions... I guess many 'social justice warriors' (for want of a better term) see it as 'prejudice by proxy' - merely a belief that dodgy viewpoints should be allowed to be spoken/heard is enough to constitute an avowal of those dodgy viewpoints.  But is there really anything inconsistent or partisan about strongly disagreeing with (e.g.) transphobic opinions and believing those who voice them are being arseholes by creating an atmosphere where transgender people feel stifled, but simultaneously believing those accusing them (i.e. the supposed neutral) of 'prejudice by proxy' are guilty of a near parallel arseholery for trying to stifle their defence of free speech?   I'd call that a truly neutral position, because I'd argue the only people deserving of being called racist, transphobic, sexist, homophobic etc. are the ones who actually express or indicate their support for those views and opinions, meaning someone who doesn't fall under those criteria, but who is attacked with the labels regardless, is being silenced unjustly."

I have to say that even though I am what is considered a Libertarian or 'classical liberal', hence, I probably won't agree with you on much (that remains to be seen as I check more of your content out), I think you made some excellent points.  The key is that you provided intellectually based counter points as opposed to the typical 'you're a racist because you don't agree with the ideals of modern Liberalism.'   One of my main problems with say, Progressive Liberalism is that they tend to not criticize their own 'followers' when they are 'guilty' of committing the 'sins' that Progressives define as bad.  I think you flipped the ideals of Alt-Right/Conservatives onto them and presented them to be guilty of doing what they are fighting against, so to speak.  Great content overall. I hope the rest of your videos are just as intellectual as this.  Sincerely yours, a Libertarian Hispanic."

"I feel like at 6:40 Contra Points really misses the point of why people are fed up with the way 'blankphobic' is often used.  How is it a free speech microaggression?  People are fed up with how people will often throw those words to completely shut down discussion and conversation, not that it hurts their feelings.  If you want to move forward with ideas, you need to be willing to have uncomfortable conversations.  Responding to an actual dialogue with 'you're transphobic' might be their opinion, but it's usually just used to morally justify not listening to the person.  It's not going to convince anyone, they've got to actually take the time to explain why the person is wrong.  People's issue with those terms being used to shut down conversation is a lot deeper than it hurting people's feelings to be called that.  By all means, the person might be transphobic or racist or something like that and you SHOULD be able to say that.  I'm just saying that when you say that in place of an argument, you're just devolving what could be a productive conversation to name calling."
"My main objection is on the notion that only hate speech is being censored by Liberals. I‚Äôm a left libertarian. My main reason for being so is the outrageous in my eyes view that the government has a job protecting the individual from other individuals as long as they aren‚Äôt producing violence. Which is also why I disagree on censorship and the other.  I also believe identity politics are instituted to throw a bone to both bases by political elite while they continue to keep the bankers safe from ‚Äúprosecution‚Äù I truly believe our problems are caused from the left elite throwing bones to the left of the liberals and the right throwing bones further right. Leading to us never being able to agree. Call that centrist if you like, however I believe identity politics are taken advantage of."

"Nothing inconsistent about the behaviour at all, Hitchens wasn't legally preventing him from speaking in public but only stopping him doing so at a private event - the guy can say whatever he wants in public or on his own website and Hitchens wouldn't have interfered. The big problem with the video is you're conflating the right to free speech with the right to demand means from others to exercise that right - those for legally unrestricted free speech in the public sphere need not support legally forcing any institution to actively give a platform to anyone, and yet can still criticise the deplatforming on more ethical/pragmatic grounds e.g. a university should be a place where there is a free exchange of ideas because it's benefit to the students/society/promotes dialogue on a contentious issue/ the streisand effect etc, which need NOT an argument for legally forcing anyone to give a voice to anyone else. Free speech doesn't give the right of someone to post whatever they want on someone else's website if that person doesn't want it (it's their website after all), it doesn't give the right for someone to force a newspaper to publish their article on how Hitler was a great guy, and so on, yet 1) we can still argue whether they should anyway for some of the other aforementioned reasons and 2) it doesn't equate to legally stopping them from using their own means to say what they want e.g. by making their own site, speaking in a public square, getting a newspaper to agree to publish their article, and so on.  Many including you have made this mistake, and not realising when they conflate the rights of any person or institution to not be forced to publish the words or works to those they don't want, or give them a room and students to speak to with limits on freedom of the speech in itself is a fatal error in the arguments in the video."

"Thought: what if 'political correctness' is a totally bogus term which describes the universal tendency of getting offended by stuff?  'Political correctness' is framed this modern phenomenon when all it is is people getting offended. In which case, are people trying to say being offended is a new thing? People have ALWAYS been offended.  Right wing ideologues like Milo use the term to paint left wingers as sensitive snowflakes etc, saying that they privilege feelings over facts, etc. which simply isn't true. If you're right wing you're equally likely to be offended too and filter out what you consider to be uncomfortable truths, its just that what you find offensive changes.  For example, what if Milo is politically correct about capitalism, gender roles, etc? Why does he get so triggered by lesbians, gender non-conforming people and critiques of capitalism? I find his obsession with lesbians particularly baffling. He rules out our entire existence, and then goes on to complain about us taking over the media. Like what?! If we don't exist surely we can't be too much trouble!"
"You've misrepresented the actions of the Left here. The issue is not just that people get called bigots -- it's that YouTube removes and/or restricts them on that basis, that their talks on campus get shut down by protesters, that their Facebook accounts get zucc'd, etc. I never saw the Left getting shut down in the same way, during my time as a Leftist; but now that the regressive Left has entered the mainstream, they're using power they shouldn't have to actually prevent the speech of Right fringe groups.  I appreciate that you were fair to Holocaust deniers. My experience has been that those views need a platform, and that punishment of Holocaust denial only fuels the paranoia of deniers. They have legitimate concerns with the official account, and I've even had to admit to myself that the casualty count is probably inflated. If they're allowed to voice their concerns, those concerns can be argued against; but if their views become illegal then they circulate only among sympathetic characters and remain unchallenged."
"Love ya Contra. But my minority speech is minorer than your speech so shut the fuck up."
"My response: The issue isn't who gets to speak or how bad their speech is. Nor is it an absolute 'no speech or all speech' debate like some people think. The main question when dealing with fascist crackpots or anyone else is to what extent do we censor them, and who do we give power in doing so.   Kicking a fascist out of a meeting is one thing, making sure that a fascist cannot have a meeting of his own is another.  Then there's the slippery slope issue. Extreme leftists love to make the argument that right wing beliefs in them self are a 'gateway' to fascism and that it 'creates an environment' for fascism, regardless of whether that is true or not it already creates a slippery slope where any form of conservatism is able to be censored.  Not to mention they like to call anyone to the right of Emma Goldman a 'nazi' (see: Brett Weinstein) at 10:22"
"Commenting 8:05 here: There are some free speech advocats who complain about being called x-phobe or racist but most I know of would then ask for your definition of racism. There is imho a difference between thinking that the concept of races are real and thinking that races have different inherent values. If you call the former 'racism' then - by your definition - you are right about most of the sceptic community here on yt. The problem is that it is not very nuanced and without furter definition this terminology can lead to misunderstandings."

This video seems to be making a case for fascism (in the sense of forcible suppression of opposition and control of¬†individuals)."
"See i don't have an issue with calling people racist, sexist etc.. Do so as one sees fit.. However Riots like those at Berkeley where innocent nearby business owners have their workplace destroyed or the censorship of stopping those who do wish to listen to what the speaker has to say is where the issues lie. E.g. NY post constantly attacks cis white men for existing to some extent of the word - that causes outrage and upset however should be defended. However burning down a bank in Berkeley because Ben Shapiro wants to talk to college conservatives is problematic. In a workplace one shouldn't feel persecuted and I for one would always do my best to correctly Gender a Trans-human. However if one wishes to address a White man in the workplace as 'Racist white cis male' (provided they are not directly working together) then that also should be defended.

I can even tell A and B who u think is correct or incorrect. I don't have to silence either of them to agree with one and disagree with the other.  If A was a mysognist, and B was a feminist, and I agreed with B and disagreed with A, I wouldn't even have to silence A even in social pressure. If A speaks about how much A hates women, and no one agrees, cares, listens, or all 3, why is it a problem? If we were to not allow it, the mysognist could get together in an online group or physical area to meet to with like-minded mysoginists, and the social or legal suppression of their speech would just mean they do it in secret. It would be like the Chinese practicing Christianity in secret, having secret group meetings to not get Iegal trouble. Either making specific types of speech socially unacceptable, or legally banning specific types of speech doesnr stop people from speaking it all together, it just changes who they say it to and where they say it. And if they are allowed to say what they want in a public area, you have no obligation to listen if you don't want to for any reason you don't want to listen. You can provide counterarguments, or leave. Freedom of speech doesn't mean you must listen to everyone speaking. Freedom of speech does nor equal forcing everyone to listen. I would assume you're unlikely to read this comment, and someone else watching this video will see my comment in a few months and possibly reply.  Just like in disagreeing with you right now, I don't have to silence you by reporting your video, or hacking into YouTube to delete your videos, name-call you to belittle you into staying quiet, or just telling you to shut up. I can still say you can say whatever you want, while I disagree with it at the same time.  There are specific events where there is a goal the event us supposed to meet, in which not all types of speech are acceptable at that moment, like kindergarten wouldn't be a time for an adult teacher to talk about his/her favorite porn video, or yelling insults to a debater during a formal public debate is contrary to what the debate is supposed to be, so you will likely get kicked out right away or if you continue too long (depending on how strict and patient those in charge at that event are). That doesn't mean you can't make a video, or even a website all about whatever you wanted to say at that moment it was currently unacceptable.  And however silencing people's audible voices is accomplished, it doesn't change their minds or actions. They can do the actions based on the words they aren't allowed to say, and others could follow in their footsteps by imitating their actions without saying a word.  And on the transphobe, islamaphobe, racist, sexist, name-calling, many people who said nothing about those things can be called that only in an attempt to socially pressure someone to be silenced, and in some cases have their videos taken down from YouTube, or fired from their job. So many things are being calls those names where it makes no sense, such as an article I saw saying the air is racist, cold weather is racist, and STEM is sexist because of the requirements needed to get a job in STEM, such as having a low fear of failure. So these words have begun to lose all meaning when such little problems, or things that aren't problems at all are called by these words, and people begin to not care when they hear the word used where it makes sense. It's the boy who called the wolf racist."
"People are always for 'Free speech' until you disagree with them.  Then they try to silence you."
"My counter argument for 12:50 'deplatforming' speakers. A person in the crowd wanting their 15 minutes of fame =/= Richard Spencer. Advocating to deplatform Richard Spencer is (presumably) to deplatform him _EVERYWHERE_ where as to deplatform this person in the crowd is to remove _THIS ONE_ platform, because it isn't their platform to be speaking on.  The difference is if you don't let them take the mike at your conference vs if you don't let them host their own conference. Or it can be expressed as: There is a time and a place for everything. Silencing Richard Spenser is saying that he has _no_ time or place to express his views. Silencing this guy in the crowd is saying _this_ isn't his time and place."

Either everything is fair to say or we need to have exceptions. One or the other."
"This is well done, but still often disingenuous.  IE: 'the internet is just like that' vs 'academia is just like that'.  One is an open source,   theoretically non-curated space...the other is an Academy,  where the exchange of ideas is meant to be exchanged under the aegis of scholarship & methodology, not ideology.  Sorta 2 different things."
"Your thoughts are very well thought out, presented, and defended but they all fall apart because no one has the right to not be offended. Inhibiting free speech in any way whatsoever is such a slippery slope that it's better to default to keeping all speech completely open and allowed."
"i only care myself and the God let humans take care of humans problems"
"You are missing the point of the position of MOST conservatives on free speech.  It has nothing to do with a silencing effect, public pressure, backlash, propping up of ideas, etc.  The issue comes when people use violence or suggest that government force should be used to shut down speech.    Case in point liberals on college campuses are calling for 'hate speech' to be a crime and shut down, there is a huge difference between silence through peer pressure or backlash and actually shutting down free speech with force.    Limiting speech is a slippery slope that would certainly lead to an abuse of power, and a fist to silence opposing thoughts, that is why I believe there is no such thing as 'hate speech'.  There is offensive speech, that I disagree and stupid opinions left and right, but people have to be free to express them."
"If you are saying that neutral, universal freedom of speech is impossible and that partisan censorship is inevitable, than I would definitely want to support my tribe and my party. And fuck your rights, since somebody is getting fucked anyway. Tnx for the tip, dude. Luv ya."
"If free speech dempens the free speech of another person, does that say something about free speech or about that person?  Don't you think right wing people feel the tension in the room, and the social pressure? Still, we say what we think needs to be said, where left wingers often don't dear. Have you looked at your typical right winger? Do they look weak and pathetic? Now let's look at your typical green coloured hear fat ugly left wing chick. Do they seem weak and pathetic?"

"I have been insulted by experts so being called a racist is no big deal.  Personally, I think it's a bad strategy to accuse everyone you disagree with a racist.  Also, using violence to shut down speech is a non starter."
"Well... there's some good arguments in this. However... whether or not it's the 'right side' (not really knowing who we are talking about) I'm not sure is so obvious. I think it's pretty obvious that the recent Wilfrid Laurier incident clearly show the authoritarian left having gone too far. However... most of the people I see being up in arms about it are not some I generally regard as intellectually honest."
"While i won't make comments about the content of what you're saying, i'd like to take a minute to comment on your delivery and setting. You seem to be at all times rushing your delivery to get as many words into as little time as possible. This is further exacerbated by the constant cutting between sentences, leading to no downtime and basically creating paragraphs with no full stops in them (whether this is a common thing for your content, i do not know, but this is the only video i watched). The lighting in the main section is also quite poor, as you can see much brighter sections on the side of your face, when you turn your head at certain angles. This is a pretty rookie mistake, in my opinion. I reserve my right to critique these points and i hope you can receive this to improve your future content."

"Okay, I have an issue with your equivalence of being called bigoted = being subjected to mocking for being left. If you are called racist, for instance, they are saying that you are _immoral_. They are saying that there is something bad about you as a person and they judge you far more than if you were just something they deemed cringey, such as transphobes who think that anyone who IDs as nonbinary is a 'tumblrina' or whatever.  I'd also disagree with the equivalence of being called bigoted to being subjected to bigotry. As someone who's experienced both, I can say with complete certainty that I've never felt silenced with bigotry. I've always been able to talk back and either walk away from the bigots or shut them down. When someone claims that I'm bigoted, I am effectively silenced and don't even get to explain my opinion, and people think much less of me. Edgy alt-right shitlords tend to judge you less for being a minority than far-left 'SJWs' will judge you for holding more centrist/right-leaning views.  Edit: I do agree that calling someone racist/homophobic/etc isn't suppression of free speech, though. That's just using your own free speech."

"The difference between the SJW cringe compilations silencing SJWs vs the 'you said you like bananas therefore racist' attitude in left and campuses is that one is true (provably by video evidence) and the other is almost always bullshit (citation; Contrapoints video on 'dogwhistles' of the alt right) hence why the left has become a parody of itself. The left is a joke and has lost all credibility."

"Re. Absolute freedom of speech as a rule. It is not a bad rule. True it does turn out to be so that it is not realistic to hear what everyone has to say. But the principle when generally followed is more efficient. EDIT: It also facilitates the spread of knowledge more effectively."
"Re. example of 'shit lords' being silenced in a college class vs. gender fluid people being silenced on YouTube. Dont you think that is a false equivalence? A youtube channel is a dime a dozen. While a college education costs upwards of $10,000. Also, expressing a view that is unpopular among a group of people while being in front of those people in real time vs. expressing a view on line in the safe space of a make shift studio are not the same. A gender fluid person who wants to say something on YouTube is not actually under the same kind of pressures as a 'shit lord' in the confined space of a gender studies course."
"Much of the left does have a tendency to shut people down, throw around insults and respond with outrage rather than discussion with people who fail to embrace a plethora of complicated concerns within an accepted spectrum of thought. Snobbery and arrogance are often to blame, as well as the left simply not having the guts to get its hands dirty by communicating with people who have genuine fears and concerns that conflict with the left's pillars of allowable wisdom. This is very dangerous and is allowing classical liberals, rebel conservatives and the populist right to take the moral high ground; this is very dangerous."
"Liberals Aren't Leftists. ü§£"
"As to your criticism of classical liberals in comparing the internet vs universities- honestly, you erect a bit of a false comparison here because the criticism we have in the context of universities is that of the public ones financed with taxpayer funds.  That IS the state engaged in content based censorship and restriction of speech."
"People love Hitchens so much because he doesn't censor himself. We're tired of all these proposed restrictions that come wrapped in 'Be nice' When that isn't it, at all. George Carlin was right."

"I don't understand the cutaway skits yo."
"Dave Rubin and Hitchens are the best! Making fun of their emotional responses to liberty is mean.   You should be silenced for hate speech! (Kidding, but I really do love the people you're trying to crucify)"
"Even if Richard Spencer does deserve to be silenced, the point is that you have to let people speak so you can learn what they really think. Isn't it wrong to go around assuming you understand everyone's full perspective and go on silencing them on that basis? Logically to learn what someone believes don't you have to let them tell you first? Also the whole problem with fascism or authoritarian democracy is that it assumes the people who control the state know enough to know what is perpetually true or worth silencing. If you limit the crazies the question becomes who judges who is crazy? Its for the purposes of the freedoms not only of the current generation but the subsequent that you neglect the state the power to declare certain types of speech violent."
"and Jordan Peterson isn't a transphobe... you are ridiculous for insinuating that bullshit notion."
"your point concerning people being silenced by negative YouTube comments versus being silenced by someone literally yelling 'islamaphobe' In your face while you are trying to speak are to different arguments. being silenced because of negative comments on YouTube is you giving up... no one can silence your speech on YouTube via trolling your comments unless you allow it... where as on a college campus one is literally being shouted down... i.e. evergreen college..."

"Generally good video, however I think its too uncharitable to Hitchens, his take on free speech is very similar to that of contras; as seen in his 'Freedom of expression must include the license to offend' 2006 debate (Philip Gourevich is great in that), the 2007 conversation with¬†¬†Shashi Tharoor, and his memoir Hitch 22."
"Reddit brought me here. Your 'used to have a boner for Hitchens' joke was amazing. I laughed for like 3 minutes. Thank you for some amazing trans humor to go with your excellent video"
"I watched about 3 of your other videos and liked them. This one is confusing.   First you mention steelmanning, but then almost everything that follows is a strawman.  The issue with the non-far-left free speech claim is about two things:   1.) De-platforming and silencing non-leftist speakers (and sometimes leftist speakers) on campuses for not adhering to *every single bit* of far left doctrine. This happens often. If you can't agree, we can't agree on reality and facts. This serial, organized pathology is happening across the country. It's actively stopping speech. Does the right protest Angela Davis or any other leftist speaker? Never happens. Likewise, are silly dipshits on youtube and twitter the same thing as actively stopping a physical speaking event? Nope. Twitter comments cannot stop someone from tweeting/speaking. These are not comparable things.   2.) If a person brings up, say, immigration policy (in principle, nothing wrong with discussing it), leftists will call them bigots, white supremacists, etc. They also make people get fired. Over nothing. Wear the wrong shirt? Fired! Say the wrong word? You're up on Title IX, bitch! Your strawman here is acting as if every target of the far left has been Richard Spencer. Not even close. Sommers gets shut down. She's Fing adorable and harmless. Wtf.   RE: Hitchens issue  I took Hitchens to mean that letting anyone speak (religious or no) would potentially piss off the fags. women, etc. This could range from the clergy saying gays are evil, to a dummy like Shapiro saying trans people are mentally ill. We shouldn't close free speech down just for that. I don't think there's anything else to say about it. It's consistent with everything else he said. What's the problem.   Your 911 vs Holocaust comparison was also muddy. Hitchens would be fine allowing that 911 dolt his own venue to speak at (just like he would a Holocaust denier), but certainly not in the QandA part of a talk he's giving. You're conflating different things. One is a principle, the other is an instance at his own event. Does anyone think Hitchens would protest a 911 truther or call for their event to be closed? Plenty were around when he was and he never did. No contradiction.   The right say plenty of silly stuff, but I think they're on solid ground with their free speech angle. Do college Republicans routinely disrupt Michael Moore or any other liberal speaker on campus? I've certainly never heard of anything like that. And if any did, they would be just as wrong as anyone else doing it.   And you leave St.Hitchens alone!!"
"Your still obviously a guy, bad try. You degenerate guy."
"Extremely smart and funny. I still have a lot of respect for Hitchens, but he was wrong and a douche a lot of the time, let's be honest."
"These videos aren't good.  Not even fucking well thought out."
"If you want to see marginalized Americans, go to a W. VA coal town, a dying manufacturing town in the Midwest, or one of any number of inner-city ghettos. University students are privileged, not marginalized.  Fuck them!"

"As someone who's first language is Chinese, those quotes are....hilarious. Sounds like the so called 'intellectuals' in the Chinese web as well. Damn you've seen the crashing flames that is the Chinese web? (Despite actual censorship?)"
"The thing is that the left is accusing people of racism, homophobia, antisemitism, Nazi ideologies, fascism etc. by redefining the definitions of these words and using them to end speech (i.e. You are a racist therefore there is nothing else to discuss) when their targets have a different opinion. And they prevent those from attending lectures they want to hear to hear those lectures. And the left have been using violence claiming the ideas are assaulting them. Bullshit.   Another is how antifa have claimed that Milo is a Jew hating racist homophobe when he is a gay man who only dates black men and he is also half Jewish! While I don't agree with everything Milo says (Israel) I find a lot of what he says absolutely true. The left have become unhinged.   I live in Berkeley and I am sick of what the left have become, antifa, and bullshit arguments that quite frankly just don't add up. The left have given the attention / or platform by their actions to shut down speakers and used violence against people under false reasoning. Having been bullied as a child in school (in the south) I wouldn't change it for the world. Through dialogue and action when I graduated I was one of the most popular students. 'David's a fag but he's alright he's pretty cool'. The bullying at younger ages gave me strength and character and taught me a lot about life. The reality of the world and how to rise above it and confront then change those that hated me. Kids these days are so pampered and babied. We are rearing sissies and pussies who we see entering the real world are totally unprepared. We've done a disservice to these people and teaching them that they must see racism and fascism under every rock and even to use actual fascism to fight this delusional fascism. What the fuck?"
"Why is the dude in a dress keep popping up on my damn feed?"
"I almost disliked the video as I dislike Hitchens so much."
"Godammit I love you so much"
"12:37 - You are mistaken about Hitchens and 911 truthers. That man who he had removed had been following him around for his entire trip, asking him the same questions over and over, at that point he had grown tired of him. He addressed this in an interview after this event and he has addressed 911 truthers without reacting this way many times before. Now, you do semi-make up by saying no one can be perfect... oh man, this is going to sound bad.... i'd say he is as close to perfect as it gets with this record as he didnt deplatform him because of what he was saying, he did it because the guy was basically a stalker. Ill see if i can find the interview, but the guy was a nut job and if Hitchens was truthful about what he was saying, it all makes much much much more sense."
"666th dislike was made by meeeeeee"
"Love your videos, but I think you make a leap here.  When Hitchens said that it's not just the right of people to speak but it's the right of everyone else to be able to hear, I don't think he meant that everyone deserves a large platform. I think he was simply saying that it's important to think of freedom of speech from not just the perspective of the person trying to speak, but the potential knowledge lost to those around them *by restricting their freedom.*   Similarly, when he said that unpopular views should receive special *protection,* again, I don't think this means they should be heard by more people, it means we should be especially careful to *not* infringe on their rights.   In other words, I think his speech is more about the negative right (not having your views infringed) than a positive right (deserving a platform). That is how I always interpreted this. I could be wrong though."
"I was watching this to procrastinate on my capstone project on social cooling, but ideas and sources here are super relevant. üëÄ"
"Why does everyone keep using the term 'liberal' indiscriminately? A real liberal is fdr or bernie not fucking sargon or hitchens. Great vid by the way"
"He is so absolutely incoherent and has no logical stand point. So I agree with most things in this video, I really do (but you don't get attention online starting a comment like that and I'd like an actual discussion...) but I feel there's a logical leap which puts a big hole in this. They equate individual opinion/ideas to racial/gender comfort. They also act as if the way the people fighting for feminism (or whatever you want to call that stand point) are equal to the way people fight for 'freedom of speech'  The complete shutdown of someone opinion attacking (physically or financially) them or creating a situation where they literally cannot be heard is very different from someone feeling they can't express themselves free of condemnation. The Hitchens scenes are perfect examples, what he said is 100% appropriate imo. What he did was exactly not appropriate, Idk the context but still seems very poor way to treat it. Similarly the DeAmore situation(Google employee fired for opinion that went against Google policy, google it lol) he states there was an 'atmosphere' or feeling that you can't hold his opinion, imo that while not being optimal is for a lack of better word 'ok' but when they fired him they are purposefully removing his platform to speak and also attacking him financially. These are ways that empowered people shutdown free speech in public discourse but when in one on one or small private discussions they often claim arguments are bad because speaker is bigotted which doesn't shutdown free speech literally but it does counter the intention of free speech or they get all 'antifa' and 'punch a nazi' which I don't think I need to explain why violence over words is not acceptable. Now to show how racism sexism and *insert*phobia does not impeach on their free speech, still a grotesque point of view tho. Calling trans people gross or homosexuals faggots does not literall take away their ability to talk or express themselves, it does not impede on their ability to earn money, it is not equal to physical violence. When the do break one of those 3 rights that's different and I don't think the 'classic liberals' want to defend those people, even if they do I do not.  I consider the spewing of racism sexism and miscellaneous phobias similar to people calling people bigots in a discussion(not equal in sin though), it's behaviour that shouldn't happen or be encouraged and that through proper discussion and confronting the people when they do it, it will hopefully be as rare as violence in debates. I honestly agree with them though that society can make a person feel uncomfortable openly discussing opinions which is terrible but it's not equal to actually stopping free speech(which the left isnt the only people guilty of but do seem pretty caught up in atm)"
"8:25 You don't need to choose between suppressing one person's speech or another's.  Everyone can speak.  Universities are where people are supposed to be exposed to new and sometimes challenging ideas.  This is part of getting an education.  People say mean things on the Internet, the left do it all the time, so do the right.  Part of becoming an adult is learning that someone else's words only hurt you if you let them."

"The left is fascist"
"Oh hey I love liberals who hate Christopher Hitchens."
"i would say that freedom of speach should be limited to freedom of debate where both sides can respond. allow the bigot to speak then deplatform them just like you did. the problem with Christian extremists, feminists like anita Sarkisian, racail advocates like the black block and others is that they forget free speach is a two way street and that you should respond in debate to defend your ideas instead of shutting your opponent down. let them speak then respond with a more logical argument no matter how hurtful or stupid the argument is because as long as the system refers to a fair society for all the just will always win the debate."
"Dude, read these comments and imagine someone talking like this on the street. Lol no one talks like this away from a keyboard, where we remember life is plenty shitty without throwing more polarizing ideals in the mix. The left sucks. The right sucks too. Two flawed systems.

"First, thanks for all these fantastic videos. I've learned a lot and been hugely entertained too. My partner and I have been binge watching your channel for the past couple of nights and we love it - and you! It's the best thing on Youtube: that's meant to be a compliment, not a diss, btw ;).  My usual rule is not to comment on Youtube but this piece provoked a few thoughts which might be worth sharing. I live in the UK and it made me think about the recent shitstorm in the British Labour party in which a flurry of allegations of anti-semitism have been made. In the great majority of cases, these allegations are unfounded and some were outright fabricated by pro-Israeli lobbyists, in a co-ordinated effort to shut down criticism of Israel, as well as to smear the Labour left (supporters of Jeremy Corbyn). It's a good example of how a left-wing issue (anti-racism) can be weaponised by the right wing as a method of suppressing free speech, in the manner of concern trolls. However, if you point out that the allegations were maliciously cooked up by pro-Zionist lobbyists, you run the risk of being smeared again as some kind of 'conspiracy theorist', despite the fact that this is provable (al Jazeera exposed them in an undercover documentary).  So that got me thinking about the whole question of how we interact with people who may be labelled as 'conspiracy theorists' and how that label is also used quite deliberately to suppress free speech - e.g. by Christopher Hitchens in your video. I put the phrase in inverted commas because I'm well aware of its use as a term of abuse and a propaganda tool: We have become conditioned, in the manner of Pavlov's dogs, to recoil from the phrase and automatically dismiss anything that attracts such a label, regardless of whether it's rational or not, or the merits of the arguments. We have become conditioned to accept that all 'conspiracy theories' are insane, hence there can never be any real conspiracies ... of the powerful ... which is kind of useful if you happen to be powerful and feel like doing some conspiring. :) There's a good article on Alternet about this:  http://www.alternet.org/civil-liberties/how-cia-invented-and-promoted-conspiracy-theories-discredit-controversial-views  To be honest, I find climate change deniers and holocaust deniers particularly tiresome but we must still look beyond the labels if we are going to safeguard free speech. For example, are they denying that the holocaust happened at all or are they just disputing the exact nature or extent of it? There has to be some leeway for reasonable historical scholarship on the issue, so at what point do we no-platform someone simply because they question orthodoxy? Likewise, climate science is pretty clear that warming is due to human activity but again there must be room for some dissent because science is not dogma and accepted ideas must always be open to challenge.  In order to help judge these issues I think we need an overarching principle, so I propose that we look to the motives, style and above all the power relations within the discourse. You alluded to this a couple of times in your video, pointing out that one person's free speech can act to suppress another's. Speech is rarely neutral: it can either challenge power or reinforce it. It can be liberating or repressive, as when it is used to smear some marginalised group (then we rightly call it 'propaganda').  So, people who deny that the holocaust ever happened are generally motivated by the desire to absolve fascism, to make it respectable again or to smear all Jews as propagandists. They are not really challenging the powerful; in many cases these people are quite privileged white nationalists seeking to increase their dominance through revisionism. What matters is not that they are factually wrong; it is this combined with their sinister motives and irrational style of argument which tells us they shouldn't be debated.  There is nothing inherently shameful about being wrong. We have all been wrong and will be again. Being wrong is the bread and butter of scientific and scholastic method. That's why we need to debate with people who are wrong, because occasionally they turn out to be right (even though they're mostly still wrong!) and when that happens we should rejoice because it means we can improve our own ideas.   That brings me to 9/11 'truthers', because there was a time when I had little patience for them myself. However, one cannot argue that their motives are bad - with one or two exceptions. As with feminism, there is a danger of judging a group only by the worst examples. Just as Abigail Cockbane does not represent feminism, Alex Jones and David Icke do not represent the 9/11 truth movement. As time goes by, their best arguments have been bolstered by a growing mass of hard empirical evidence, including forensic peer reviewed studies, witnesses, whistle blowers and documents. This is rational discourse, not mere speculation. Even if they are wrong (and I no longer think they are), they deserve to be heard, not smeared as 'fascists' or indeed 'conspiracy theorists'. That they are so relentlessly smeared is due to the fact that their arguments directly challenge the wealthiest and most powerful people and corporations in the world. The same was true of those who questioned the story of the Kennedy assassination(s), at a time when heterodox ideas were more freely discussed than today.  Now, when I think of the truth movement, I think of calm, rational academics and scholars such as Prof. David Ray Griffin, Richard Gage (AIA), Prof Steven Jones, Prof Niels Harrit and so on: phlegmatic, very liberal and very precise professionals, not right wing nutters. But you only hear about the nutters, because the speech of the rest is actively suppressed by a media which is not interested in free speech at all, despite its protestations. These people are primarily motivated by a desire to oppose war and imperialism - especially the case with Prof Griffin, a specialist in theology and ethics - and to restore real democracy and accountability to government. They are pretty much the opposite of fascists. Griffin deserves all the free speech he can get:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6dkRa9pTNA&feature=share  Anyway, please keep making your amazing videos. I can't get enough of them! Sorry for rambling."

There's nothing wrong with calling a right winger 'racist/homophobic/misogynistic' on a college campus. The issue is whether a open forum exists. Colleges have traditionally been public forums open to the exchange of ideas. If a right winger makes statements on your campus, you and your organizations have every right to produce counter-speech to rebut this speech.   No classical liberal believes speakers should be free from criticism. They should, however, be free of silencing tactics/violence/retribution. This goes both ways.   The university as an institution (at least a public university) cannot close the public forum to voices it deems invalid. That is an act of state power. The state has no role to pick winners in the marketplace of ideas. You set the boundaries at hate speech. But what is 'hate speech'?  An attempt to define 'hate speech' typically devolves into 'speech I don't like'.    Historically oppressed people who were silenced in the past should see the danger in closing public forums because the boundaries of permitted speech should not be determined by who is in power. Progressives run universities now. (But what if in the future they don't?)  Anyway, great channel, despite our disagreements."
"The comments under this video tell you all you need to know how much contempt the left has for free speech‚Ä¶"
"Free speech = allowing and providing space for minority voices to be heard. But then he/she puts woman the majority of population as needing minority consideration. Big blind spot!"
"leftist terrorists are at war with free speech gooby"
"Am I missunderstanding this or is ContraPoints equating practical limits to free speech (like lack of a platform or abuse from people) with legal limits to free speech? I don't think many right wingers are complaining about getting hate for their positions, what I do see is a frustration with accusations of e.g. transphobia and islamophobia (which are connected to hate speech laws) whenever someone criticises islam or certain aspects of the heritage/environment debate. Legal limits and practical limits may be equally bad at a certain point in time but I think legal limits have a much bigger potential of being harmful. Anyway this seems like a brilliant and much needed channel."
"Have you seen a feminist cringe compilation? If you're view points are rational in any possible way and not entirely ridiculous you will most likely not be in there"
"the left was/is about getting the means of production, so that a worker earns the fruit of his/her labour  In that process, our beside that process, you can say what you want, our what you don't want.   I can say : i like banana's, Disney is bad for Children, roses are red, Football is good for your health, porn is empowering, porn is mysoginy, games should be less violent, we need more violence in games etc.   The thing is, their is a vague line, where the free opinions, turns into hate speech. The sentence : i like popcorn, is a different free speech than : blacks should die.  There is a line, where an opinion, becomes a threat to other people. The thing is, the left ( in the past )  had the tendencie to see this crossing of the line into everything. There used to be a sort of paranoia, according to free speech turning into violence.   So, its not that the left is against free speech, its that certain tendencies tend to focus to much on decoding words, in order to check out if it could somehow hurt someone, sometime.   But than again, that isn't the banning of free speech, thats just hyper sensitivity, and overreaction.   And also, what is 'the left'. Am i, as a left libertarian ( anarchist ) 'the left'. What do you define 'the left'. The sort of identity tendencies you see as banning free speech, are just some sub faction, that arose in the 70's, its not 'the left', its a movement within the left, our within certain parts of the left."

"You like David Lynch, don't you?"
"I was a dick to you in past videos.. But... The more I watch... The more I understand."
"You're conflating two different things here--the right to speak ideas and the right to sling abuse--and it weakens your argument somewhat. I can say that, for instance, your average racist youtube commentator is WAY out of line when they hurl their usual equivalent of 'fuk u!' into a comment, but if someone like Richard Lynn were to make a youtube channel explaining why race differences in intelligence are a thing (not saying I believe him necessarily), they would be allowed to speak. And, for feminist equivalents, things like immediately insulting someone as an 'XXX-phobe' might be wrong, but Sarkesianite critiques are cool. In other words, something like the approach the Geneva Convention or the Hague took to warfare.   Also, the thing about the 'feminist microaggressions' you mention is that they are different from behaviour on the internet for a few reasons as well--for one, generally speaking an internet insult won't be followed by someone deciding not to be your friend because you're a Trump supporter or whatever, which I'm vaguely aware happens to Trump supporters. Generally, this won't be done in a way that interrupts the speech, also. Of course, there are aspects of the behaviour right-wingers and their satellites exhibit on the net that are a LOT more fucked up, but you're ignoring a lot of the 'social' nature of social pressure.  So, in the end, I don't think you have to pick a side, and neutrality is achieved by socially enforcing civility and respect, as well as fine-tuning your 'gone too far' detectors."
"The framed picture of Anita Sarkeesian is a nice touch."
"you never addressed laws made against hate speech. you mentioned them but did not address them. why bring them up if you're not gonna touch them because you understand the implications?"
"New fan great information and wonderful perspective. I will be stealing some of it. The attempts at humour I can do without but I understand why you do it. Good job"
"Your mind has been perverted by identity politics. You see people as a member of a group (that you define with a broad brush) rather then seeing people as individuals."
"Great points and well said."
"Great video and presents nuance for someone trying to navigate some of the inherent contradictions of free speech absolutism. As far as prohibitions against Nazi imagery in some of the countries hardest hit in the second world war, I thought there were exceptions that allowed for their use in terms of historical or use in imagery against fascism (like a swastika with a red circle and a line through it)."
"Man, I remember your vids before you were 'Contrapoints'. You've really 180'd on Hitchens (thank fuck)."
"absolutely fantastic!!!!"
"Dave Rubin is not clever enough or original enough to deserve any kind of rebuttal. The new atheists such as Hitchens and Sam Harris miss the mark on some important issues.  But overall they are quite clever individuals.  Rubin, not so much.  Ignore him."
"'Minority viewpoints' Aren't viewpoints of minorities."

"This is great. I love the comedy segments as well as the bulk of the essays."
"8:14 What the hell are you talking about?! Are you really equating trolls commenting on a youtube video to protests preventing a speech from happening in a university?!   May Odin, Baal or whatever's up there save the left from the likes of you."
"Thank you for making this video. Previously I only thought of free speech in terms of governmental interference. Thus I saw it solely as a value neutral position due to the fact administrations are prone to twist the intent of legislation to essentially punish those it was designed to protect.   But thinking of it in terms of culture I can see it as stacking in favor of the powerful when invoked. Just I previously didn't for obvious reasons."
"The problem is not being called a racist. I don't care what you call me. The problem is that this is the first step towards hurting or firing someone. 'Hey guys, it's OK to punch Nazis! Look, here is a Nazi! Punch him!' Or, 'Fire him! He is racist!' This is by definition anti-free speech in the worst manner."
"Is it a microaggression, if it results in you loosing your job? You should reeducate yourself about microaggressions..."

"i dont angree with you with the state shouldn't censor/ suppress hate speech,  im gland germany wont allow the nazi flag but i think its would be too much if every country in the world would censor as much as germany, for me the historical context matters on what and how much the state should block the spread of hate speech"
"I always knew Hitchens was an anus, even in my short-lived atheist years."

"There's only one good thing about the spread of radical Islam.  At least, they're gonna persecute freaks like this."
"In order for speech to be free, it needs to have a price in the first place."
"I'm glad you chose(tried) to take on Hitchens ideas, because he's as far from a low hanging fruit. I will say that I disagree with you on fruitless claims in acedemia and youtube. I defitnely disagred with you on multiple things, but I will say that you seem to put a lot of work into your videos and points, so I give you that. Good job.   As far as Hitchens goes, I would recommend his last book Mortality(if you haven't read it),it's both humanizing and depressing."

"You're so funny :')"
"'So in a sense, these people are being silenced by the misogynistic and transphobic atmosphere --'  Everyone gets hate mail on youtube. Didn't stop me from doing another channel, back in the days, debunking 9/11 Truthers."
"The difference of being called 'racist' 'sexist' 'homophobic' or 'nazi' and being called 'tranny' 'dyke' 'SJW' or 'femnazi' is that no one (that I know off) has been fired, had their livelihood being threaten or was deplattform because someone called that. Meanwhile people were being fired, demonetized and deplattformed for being called racist, sexist etc. So the differences is not that both are hurtful and might cause you to not speak out in fear of the conesquences, but that the potential impact is vastly different.   If the worst thing that might happen to you if you are being called a nazi is that you end up up in a youtube 'highlight' reel that makes fun off you, I don't think anyone would complain about the 'left' threating freedom of speech."
"I knew Rubin and Hitchens was largely full of shit. Thanks for this great video."
"I like the style of your video @contrapoints even though I have a fundamental disagreement with your argument I still enjoyed this video. Here's my view on giving platforms to nazis... let them talk, if their ideas are bad, they will make themselves look stupid and likely make nazi-ism seem less appealing and more irrational."
"'There is no phone. There is only destiny.'"
"Yes, even Holocaust deniers. And pornographers. And Sargon and Gazi Kodzo. And dorks like me who incessantly comment on all their silly YouTube videos.  Once you start injecting personal taste into speech regulations (formal or implied) you invite institutional preference for the majority view, and the silencing of dissent.  And who wants that?"
"But who gets to define which speech qualifies as hateful and should therefore be censored? Words like 'misogynist' have been broadened to the point where they can now mean almost anything, and therefore can be used to smear anyone who the powerful want to smear."
"Your lighting is fucking disgusting.  Good video tho"
"The internet is not a tax payer funded organization, college campuses are. Your point about people accepting that they are called racists there is ludicrous. PSEUD ALERT!"
"Insinuating jp is a transphobe lol You are suddenly an expert psychoanalysis?"
"Mysoginists or woman lol, racists or people of color. Bruh, you are trying to be an intellectual and you just fail so hard. Both of these groups of people can have platforms. Also, your word choice is obnoxious. Women or evil mysoginists. Like the left doesn't have their own cancer. Innocuous people of color, vile racists. Cool, no slant at all here"
"Also, when you say allowing all speech dampens free speech because muh feelings that is lame. If one has conviction, then you will sat what needs to be said! Getting doxed blows, but that freedom of speech is still there, it just takes courage"
"'If you can't take the heat get out of the kitchen [online].' Your response to then tell those same people to accept that you'll be called a racist on college campuses is absurd lol. The internet is not academia. College campuses are supposed to be the center for debate, ideas, and intellectual progress. To call someone a racist without proof is wickedly dishonest and anti-intwllectual. I like your cinematography, but your pseudo intellectual opinions are in fact cringeworthy m8. Step it up up uo"
"Not funny at all.. personal opinion. And dude.. you must spend a shit load on makeup cause you painted your face like a Japanese geisha.."
"I didn't know how much I had needed this video before I watched it  And as a sidenote, this made me realize I'd idolized Hitch a bit too much. In the end, though, despite his whole-hearted support for 'protecting the free speech of others', he stood up for the right side by not tolerating, to quote, 'fascist crackpots'."
"People have the right to say what ever they want, no matter how much a person might disagree with that viewpoint. People got to universty to learn knowledge to study their books and to challenge their ideas, how can these students learn about taking criticism if people do not have the right to criticise their viewpoint because of safe spaces, the student will grow up believing that people should be obliged to give them respect, respect is earned not given and people who do not wish to listen to criticism of their the viewpoint are naive and foolish. For if the student should enter the world of work and not be able to accept criticism that individual will not last very long."
"I agree with a bit of what you said, but I feel like a point that is missed is that often people will get labeled as being a fascist, Nazi, mysogynist, etc, when it's not called for at all. A good example of this is the Everest College fiasco that happened recently. The main professor is a progressive who was critical of the tactics the student union was taking. Suddenly he's labeled an alt-right racist fascist for having a general criticism."

So, how in the fuck is speaking out against a governmental conspiracy fascist? Besides it's been proven that 9/11was an inside job by the declassified 28 pages of the  joint investigation into the cause of 9/11 by the Senate Select Committee on Intellegence and the House Permanent Select Commitee on Intellgence. The Saudi Royal family and the Saudi Intellgence agency aided and funded the 9/11 hyjackers, and all of the top brass (as well as a few Saudi Princes) were trained at Quantico, RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!  If you need more proof, then you either haven't been paying attention or are a complete moron, ;\"
"I feel like there needs to be a distinction made between individual free speech versus group free speech, because political correctness isn't necessarily imposed outside of the political arena (although probably still suggested, which is also speech). Because PC-culture is also a form of speech, but just at a larger-scale, cultural level of free speech."

I was wondering to myself at what point I should 'censor' him, being that I like to allow for viewpoints that differ from my own (because I have changed my mind on certain issues in the past). But when his ranting makes it so other individuals on my list feel unwelcome or afraid to share their point of view, it seems like a good idea to remove the platform I have been providing for him. Allowing him to continue on in a manner that discourages the important contributions of others is a perfect time to block him from commenting. You've helped me make an important decision :)"
"Such a great video omg <3"
"Right Wingers interpret Freedom of Speech as an Obligation to Listen and Give Them a Platform to speak on."
"Is dismissing 1 guy's question at YOUR panel the same level of 'de-platforming' as a swarm of college students continually shouting to prevent a speaker's event from operating?  I'm fine with hitchens telling the 9/11 truther guy to shut up and leave. I'm also fine if the 9/11 truther guy wants to hold his own speakers-event. Probably no one will come to the latter."
"I don't think Hitchens was saying 'fags, women, and jews' should just 'take' the verbal abuse or 'take' the words of a homophobe, sexist, anti-semite. Hitchens was saying we can't shut down their speech because it offends us, but feel free to either respond with a harsh judgement or to ignore the fools who are spouting that nonsense. No classical liberal is ever saying 'just take it.' The danger is when we label people a homophobe, or anti-semite, and then shout them down as opposed to listening in order to truly figure out if they are a homophobe or whatever.  When a child is being a greedy little mean bastard, you don't shout at them without letting them get a word in.  You explain to them why their behavior is unacceptable. People who are homophobes are VICTIMS of an ideology or a way of thinking. They were brainwashed into that way of thinking. I used to be homophobic as a fundamentalist Christian, and I guarantee you I didn't change my views because people called me a homophobe or told me to shut up or shouted me down - that response of disapproval or disgust is only effective if the homophobe actually has a close enough relationship with the person to where they actually care what the person thinks of them. If I expressed my homophobia to a girl who I was interested in, and she showed she was repulsed by me because of it, that would have far greater of an effect on reconsidering my attitudes/beliefs than if a stranger on the internet reacted that way."
"this video is v. close to my heart"
"Counterpoint 1 (Legal Free Speech): In this video you made little to no mention of the idea of legal free speech, focusing almost entirely on the idea of individuals or groups choosing not to listen or comprehend certain speech. While I'm sure many confused 'classical liberals' Skeptics have focused on leftist individuals refusing to listen to others, this video did not really tackle the more serious accusation levied at some leftist that they are attempting to legally regulate speech (ie individuals do not choose what speech they listen to anymore).   Counterpoint 2 (The very idea of platforming and de-platforming): You framed your argument around the idea that everyone silences some forms of speech no matter how much of a bleeding heart liberal they claim to be. Again, this is a valid way to combat confused 'classical liberal' Skeptics, but it conveniently avoids a different point that precisely this culture of choosing which speakers are 'platformed' is something which a net negative for humanity (ie we become increasingly divided because we end up in our separate bubbles). While it is obvious that selective listening always must play some role in life, the argument would be that the modern leftist 'SJW' ideology propagates this form of close-mindedness. We should accept our inevitable close mindedness as you describe, but we should not celebrate it through the process of platforming or de-platforming."
"Sorry, but this was just a weak, disingenuous argument loaded with logical fallacies masquerading as 'reasonable arguments' as well as ContraPoints ContraDicting himself (namely what he says at 8:47 - 8:51 and then what he says at 9:12 - 9:22) to get his point across.  Contra, why don't you just stick to making skits, do some makeup tutorials or something, and maybe even some video production/editing tutorials? YOU'RE SO MUCH BETTER AT THOSE THINGS!"
"The fallacy that seems implicit here is that what a person has to say is a function of who they are - is a function of their identity. But that's wrong. It IS more important to have a climate in which those with marginalized viewpoints feel comfortable expressing them, than it is to create a climate in which people who are marginalized for things that have nothing to do with their viewpoints can express their viewpoints, which are no more or less likely to be marginalized than anybody else's.  Ideally you'd have a climate in which everyone feels comfortable expressing their viewpoints - saying what they believe to be true. But there's a big difference between someone being unwilling to make a youtube video because of misogyny or racism on youtube, and someone in academia being unwilling to take a particular stand because they're afraid of being called a racist or a homophobe. The latter case has to do with stigma, and the use of stigma to create norms around speech."
"About that 'bigoted speech vs accusations of sexism, racism, etc' thing-  I think those aren't the same thing; calling someone 'racist', 'nazi', 'homophobe', etc is a direct attempt (or at least appeal), intended to silence, and those accusations are a small, clearly defined set of words. But 'bigoted speech' is almost totally subjective and open-ended, and it's incredibly common for claimed 'bigoted speech' to not be *intended* to silence minority voices, or for there to be genuine disagreement on what, exactly, constitutes 'bigoted speech'. Unless someone creates an objective , clear definition of 'bigoted speech', because currently that claim is a blank cheque."

"Openly denouncing another person's opinion is not in and of itself a violation of a persons ability to express their opinion; while creating an environment where it is essentially impossible for your opponent to express her opinion is. Imagine if viewers of this video had the ability to edit in audio of them yelling 'STFU' over your original audio. Would it be wrong to do that if we could? If yes, then why isn't it wrong for people to do the same with bullhorns in real life?"
"As someone who hates Rubin, love Hitchens, and a pro-science progressive; I think it's worth pointing out that when opposition to a viewpoint is expressed with fists, clubs and physical intimidation, then those wielding the fists and clubs are in fact suppressing free speech. In the USA, the people we see doing this the most are on the left. Historically this has not always been the case. Anyway, enjoyed the video."

Anyone and everyone puts their pressure on you to support them, you have to do well in school, earn a trade, court a woman, raise a family, get a job, be a shining example of what it means to be a man.  It's much, much easier to live life as a woman, everything is literally done for you, shed a few tears and you have everyone's undivided attention, it's a fucking party for women.  I guess that's why most trans people are Male to Female and not so many Female to Male.   Unfortunately to be a man, it takes being a man."

"Such a dope vid"
"We do not argue that calling people racist is silencing. If anything, we criticize the overuse of terms like 'racist' and 'sexist' because it has the opposite effect of reducing thier emotional impact. Silencing is storming the stage and shutting down the event. Silencing is chanting so loud, the speaker can't be heard. Silencing is tearing up posters, doxxing people, threatening people, attacking people. This goes beyond calling people 'racist'. I could care less if my opponent's method of argumentation is disingenious. Weak opponents don't threaten my free speech. At least those people are willing to be opponents.  You make the argument that free speech should not free you from public scrutiny but contradict that sentiment in your defense of hate speech legislation. Those friends of your's that are afraid to express their opinions online for fear of public backlash are not the kind of people free speech exists to facilitate. The market place of ideas is a battle ground, reserved only for those willing to fight.  Those who need the state to strengthen their hand before they can engage are the enemies of this market place and I see no utility in granting them the power they demand."
"I have some questions for anyone who supports the anti-hate speech measures (and yes, I am advocating for freedom of speech for all speech, including the wrong and evil ones). So far I haven't met anyone with a proper explanation, only with especulations about what you may think. A quick reminder, I'm not looking for a debate or to debunk your opinions, just to know what your answer to the following questions are:  Taking into account a scenario where all kind of speech you consider harmful and/or hateful is completely banned and forbidden. 1- How can you be sure that hate-speechers actually have changed their minds and haven't simply moved to more secretive and recluse forms of communication and socialization? 2- How can you be sure that hateful ideas are actually gone and you haven't just swept the dirt under the carpet? Don't you think they could be spreading or 'evolving' (not in a good sense) through alternative means? 3- How can you know who is an actual racist/misogynist,homophobic,etc if they don't speak their mind? 4- If they have to be silent about their views, wouldn't be harder to identify and fight their influence in politics, companies and the entire 'system' in general? 5- If you act towards them with fully aggressive and oppressive attitudes wouldn't create a precedent for them to do the same if they eventually got the upper hand again? 6- And wouldn't it give them reasons for claiming victimhood in the future? (Not saying that it's justified, but it's an argument that they could use to convince others to support them) 7- Also, censoring and banning their opinions will create a scenario where there's no discussion, how can you debunk and prove them wrong if they're not even allowed to speak up? How can you prove they're wrong to the people they'll try to influence if you just block their arguments from public discourse and doesn't argue back? 8- And what about those who end up just disagreeing with your ideas? Even if they initially don't agree with any hate-speech you end up censoring, you'll be pushing people to join them out of spite.  Thanks for your time."

"True classical liberals believe in the right of a university figurehead to ban speakers from speaking, because doing so is not initiating force against the ex-speaker. However, if they provide the 'pluralism of ideas' criticism of university/college campuses, they are absolutely correct. An effective university is one which exposes its students to a multitude of ideas and allows them to decide which one is best. It is not to deny a platform to someone who provides an antithesis to the ideas within the echo chamber.  Universities and colleges are directly responsible for the ideas that their students are subject to, and if some ideas are denied a platform, it creates an echo chamber which is ultimately harmful to the students because they are not allowed to engage properly with certain ideas, and it limits critical thinking. It is certainly not a breach of freedom of speech, but it is worth criticising."
"Left and right hate free speech. Left gets offended at everything. Right is Christian and controls the FCC which censors media and keeps the tv and radio from swearing. Left and and right are nuts, the dick is where you need to be."
"So glad it's back!!"
"your videos always leave me confused about what i should believe"
"While I lean towards the anti-SJW sphere, I love your videos, Contra. Of course there are things I disagree with, but this channel's content is often insightful and entertaining. I love the edgy style."
"If it comes down to choosing a side, and you choose to side with critically small minorities instead of the average, normal, vast majority of society, then you are endless self centered."
"These days conservatives won't push for legislation to eradicate your ideas or punch you in the street for holding non-violent opinions, unlike liberals. That's why its an issue for the right, this should be obvious"
"I've watched and read everything Hitchens ever produced - and the one point that he uses about Hitchens throwing the guy out and having the mic cut from him - there is a history with that guy that this YouTuber doesn't know about. This 911 truther guy would show up at all of Hitchens speeches and totally hog the mic, not give it up, ask weird questions, and recite rambling, long, bizarre monologues that had nothing to do with the issue at hand. Hitchens had dealt with this guy several times before and finally couldn't take it anymore. Hitchens actually did deal with him several times before this incident. So, it's not just some random guy that Hitchens has thrown out - it's a disruptive crazy person.  Kicking out a crazy disruptive person that you have a long history with is not even remotely the same thing has 'de-platforming' a scheduled speaker."
"'... WHICH speakers are truly marginalised, and Anita special protection.'  The Cruel Mother, she speaks through you!"
"I would totally pay to watch a debate where Jordan Peterson and ContraPoints talk about subjects related to free speech, they both are very good at communicating their points of view."
"I, uh, I would watch multiple angles of you being pegged by a woman in a lizard mask. I would watch it several times."
"There's a big difference between hate speech restrictions in the university and hate speech restrictions in the workplace.  The university is supposed to be a place to explore ideas, and rendering any ideas off-limits contradicts the purpose.  You're not supposed to talk about politics at all while working, though many people do it anyway."
"'The Silencing Effect'  Let's use that.  Great video, Contrapoints. You're an articulate woman/man who dares to debate on a platform dominated by shitlords."
"Dude, or whatever you are ... how did you turn into this creature you are today? Did you ever ask yourself how far from evolution you are? That your survival is ensured through men protecting you? What is your purpose in life when you aren't even willed to procreate? Just ask yourself how contradictive you are to nature. I am pretty sure you are aware of yourself beeing a twisted subhuman without any real goal in life. The only thing you do with your channel is confusing more and more low-testosterone crapgenetic victims that beeing so is actually an option, when it is definitely not as you would see if you try to stand your ground in Anarchy against actual men. Poor creature"
"Woah, it's back up!? I had all but given up hope, but it looks like sometimes there is a little fairness in the world."
"This could be two nifty independently released flow charts seeded anonymously into both sides of the Intersphere with a cleverly mirrored signature."
"I would simply argue that people on BOTH the left & the right take great offense to anyone's freedom of speech if it does not directly coincide with their exact points of view"
"See, what I think is the base of your whole argument, the idea that 'one speach silences another', is ridiculous.  You are conflating silencing someone versus discouraging their view. Mockery is NOT silencing. People choosing not to expose a view because they fear ridicule is not an act of silencing. If a conservative it's called an idiot by a class full of liberals, and he chooses to never talk about it, that's isn't silencing either. So no, no speach silences another, ACTIONS silence people.  Just thinking about all the implications that have the points you made in this video brings distopic shivers down my spine."
"Fuck you your so dishonest. At least your not Riley Dennis. Ps I'm still watching your videos"
"The problem is - leftist speech (be it feminist, socialist, pro choice, pro immigration, whatever) is always carried by the major institutions in Western Europe and (I presume) the US. Your position is really typical of, and endorsed within, academia. I don't need to remind you of all the times conservative voices (not racist or sexist) are being actively opposed by the institutions that are meant to be fair (faculty, editors etc). The racist fringe are extremely marginalized compared to your average teenage radfem. I am not saying that this is wrong, by the way, but your comparison comes off as slightly dishonest in this video I think.  I don't think the right has a problem with being called racists by people like you, I think that they mind being denied the same treatment that the left is constantly granted. Your friends on the left will never call something racist and then leave it be - it is always followed by all sorts of protest/action, from no-platforming to physical harm."
"I volunteer as tribute to be the big lady pegging you in a lizard mask.  Also, I love how your videos mix absurdist art with rational debate, it's a beautiful juxtaposition."
"Love the D&D reference! Can I talk you into doing videos on the social\philosophical implications of each alignment?"
"'Hate speech is silencing'.  How?"

"Why is this person magenta and green"
"This video is everything."
"Criticism is not a hindrance to your speech. Legally preventing someone from releasing a book is in no way equivalent to telling a belligerent person to leave a private venue. Violence and government censorship is. Fuck you, Contrapoints, you seemed rational for awhile, but this is too much"

"WTF is this crap doing in my recommended? now I gotta buy bleach to wash my eyes"
"I'm a little confused, wasn't this video removed? You were able to bring it back?"

"Another piece of shit, transtrender channel? What the actual fuck is this world coming to?"
"You leftists asked for censorship. Now you get what you asked for. Do you like it?"
"Yes the new takeover of classical liberalism by progressive liberals is against free speech.   Just take a look at most college campuses, the mob is trying to silence others just  because they do not like what they have to say!    Because it conflicts with their progressive liberal ideology?    Sorry it does not work that way!    The progressive liberal ideology is NOT THE ONLY ideology in America.    There are tons of classical liberals and conservatives still in America that have the right to free speech.   Why do these progressive liberals think their ideology is the only ideology?    And having a different ideology is NOT hate speech!    How convenient to label EVERYTHING you disagree with as hate speech.    You do not get to decide the rules.  We will not have only one collective hive mind that believes all others are Nazis!   That my friend would be a totalitarian America that my friend is communism!  No one is silencing free speech EXCEPT progressive liberals!"
"I don't know if it's the weed or alcohol or just you being fucking attractive but god damn you are attractive."

"I fail to see how getting your fragile sensibilities belittled would silence you. If anything, it should strengthen your resolve. Make you more apt to continue whatever it is you were doing, if nothing else than in the name of sheer defiance."
"Don't take any guff from these swine!"
"Whoa, did this vid get unbanneb? super nice :D"
"everyone has their preference and biases. Left wing will invite their speakers, right wing will invite their speakers and it all happens. People invite the people they want to speak on campuses. People invite who they want to give interviews. But the only ones that are now shutting down speech is the left. and we arent talking about social pressure. Right wingers can handle being called sexist and in fact many of them thrive on it. They will confront you if its wrong and disprove you. What they cant fight against is the Antifa people coming in with their sirens, horns, bats and pepper spray and attacking everyone there using violence to suppress it.  That is a violation of free speech, and law. They should be arrested and charged. Inciting violence is against the law too. If you catch anyone doing that, report it and have them charged. Has Spencer done it, if so then dont slug him in an interview. Record his enticing his followers to attack people, report it, the prosecutor will swear out a warrant for his arrest. He will be arrested and charged.  He hasent dont that has he? He isnt a Nazi. Hes just a racist asshole. He has the right to speak."
"So happy this video is back up."
"Glad to see the video's back up!"
"Blind leading the blind."
"You are one strange dude."
"Eww you're disgusting"
"1.  The left is trying to limit free speech.  This is not even up for debate at this point.   2.  Hate speech is defined by law, usually trial law.  You might think something is hate speech but unless it leads to charges in court it is not.    In other words saying 'hate speech' chills the narrative is garbage,  since in most cases it is just the tumbler/university consensus on what hate speech is.  Even something like Bill C-16 will die in the courts since it is a specialized requirement based on a fallacy.  ie requiring someone to use a gender pronoun, never required before, because of the pseudo science of the 76 or whatever genders."
"You assert that you have to take sides because some forms of speech silence others. But even if I am forced to take sides for each of those issues you enumerate it does not follow that I cannot take the stand that it is important and valuable that people are able to freely endorse/express whatever they see fit.  You are not even attending to the virtue that people like Dave are talking about. Perhaps you have some argument for the anti-realism of this virtue but you did not give it in this video.  Basically, you are missing the point.  And I don't find your response to the classical liberal all that compelling either. The classical liberal basically tells you that if you cannot stand the heat of the free exchange of ideas then get out of the kitchen. You respond by telling then if they cannot stand the heat of being called racists then get out of the kitchen of academia. You claim that whatever response they give is just as good as a response to them for telling you to get out of the kitchen of the internet.  But classical liberals are not complaining about being called racists. They are complaining about being shut down. And not being shutdown by some indirect demotivation by being called racists all the time. They complain about being shut down by institutional action!  That is clearly not the same.  I am quite impressed at your ability to entirely the miss point. But I look forward to your confusion about safe spaces, deplatformining, etc."
"Will you keep on with this series? I really want it to continue."
"Stop speaking for me, I don't need a liberal who hates free speech sticking up for me. Get fucked. Your side has destroyed free speech everywhere."
"Free speech is the right to say something and not be threatened with physical violence, which happens to be a very mainstream idea on the left side of politics, yknow, the same side where they threaten to unionize companies against their will."
"I love you. I don't agree with you on everything, but you always make me think."
"ITS BACK"
"Ah, it's back! Have you still got a strike on your channel though Contra?"
"oh shit this videos back"
"omg yay, it's back!"
"I agree with most of this video, feigning defence of all free speech while subtly only using this defence for hate speech. It's pretty common. however I draw issues with some points:  The person or company who creates the platform say, YouTube, has the right to remove that platform at anytime as they are, by association, supporting the content that appears on the platform. same reason a telephone company can fire you for being racist on the phone to a customer. You have the right to say whatever you want but they have the right to not support what you say. Changing or removing a platform isn't nice in most cases and, to me, represents an attempt at censorship akin to the social standards discussed in the video however it is still the right of the platform holder.  Yes, saying words like 'homophobe' or 'racist' are an attempt to silence someone's opinion however that is how society works. Other people use words like 'fag' and the 'N' word to do the same thing. people have different opinions on stuff based on the information the have and how they've been taught to process it by their society/family/friends. we say these words to express a dislike to the other viewpoint, you have a right to express that dislike and they have the right to express theirs. these words tend to shut-down arguments yes but it's your job as a believer in your opinion to keep fighting for your beliefs while being open to at least listening to others. That's called civil discussion and debate. The solution to almost every problem in western society.  hope this at least coherent."
"It took me halfway through the video to notice the framed photo of Anita (pbuh) in the background"
"Hey your video is back up. Congrgats"
"Whose speech and for whom?"
"ITS BACK!!11"
"You make interesting points but MURICA!"
"Done and done. I expect to be screamed at by a bunch of babies!  Thanks, you misogynist!"
"Sure calling someone a racist, xenophobe, misogynist and so on are a subtle way of telling you you should shut up. About as subtle as a kick in the nuts. Therefore second point along this line is bullshit, you racist!"
"Nope, (about hate speech)"
"03:20min: Did I just hear this very respected figure say you can be a  'prisoner of your own action'? Isn't that basically freedom?"
"This doesn't show up in your channel page"
"yeea it's back"
"Came from Twitter, video is watchable for me in Argentina, but it doesn't appear when looking through your channel, only from links.  PD: you're awesome!"
"seeing this in the Netherlands"
"AAAAAAAAAAAAND WE'RE BACK *CLUB HORNS*"
"Welcome back!!"
"Glad to see this back up! Youtube acts in mysterious ways"
"ITS BACK! SLAY KWEEEN"
"Second new comment since this has been restored!"
"It's back!"
"So your answer to the titular question is...yes, but others do it too? At no point did I hear you even attempt to refute the claim in question. It was an interesting video anyway, but not exactly reassuring to anyone who has the kind of doubts that you're ostensibly trying to assuage."
"I would love to see Rubin give your unpopular positions a protective platform in the form of an appearance on his show."
"I would advocate for the permitting of all speech without any exceptions; at least, certainly not for the content of speech (i.e. particular beliefs or ideologies), but perhaps the style (i.e. yelling, ad homonym or interruptions). It's not so much that I'm protecting racists and not minorities, it's that I'm protecting thoughts/ideas (be they from racists or minorities) and not feeling/sensitivities. Ideas, especially unpopular ones, hold tremendous potential for societal ideological progress; the realization that our preconceived notions were incorrect and thus we were not actually engaging in the most utilitarian practices. Even if our societal beliefs are in fact correct, we ought not discourage debate because we'd be robbing ourselves of the opportunity to rebuke the arguments of those who object, allowing their misconceptions to fester, or worse; stand unaddressed."
"The day right-wing speech actually challenges concentrations of power is the day that speech will be at risk.  Until then, it's all just noise to fuel the generic white guy's persecution complex."
"'If there weren't, there would be a whole lot more full penetration on this channel, I can tell you that.'  Sorry leftists, now I support freedom of speech. ;)"
"These fashy troll jackasses mean nothing by 'freedom of speech' than their right to harass people without any pushback whatsoever.  Jeremy Christian thought that 'freedom of speech' meant his right to scream at girls on the train and to murder anyone who interfered.  I mean that was the exact thing he was yelling about at his arraignment  Christian is nothing more than the average shitty redditor or chantard taking the way they act on the internet into the real world.  And now of course those same worthless scum are holding a 'free speech' rally in the same city where I guarantee ideas outside of what kek prescribes will not be welcome.  They mock the dead, whose murder they cheer, and call it free speech.  I'm not playing along with that horseshit."
"Oh boy, this week's puzzle requires knowledge of music. Now I get to feel like an idiot."
"Jason Unruhe did a video on this exact thing years ago."
"'Because being called racist in person is not the same as people taking advantage of the anonymity of the internet to harass content creators.  Because there's a level of respect you're suppose to have for people in front of you, and not just call them mean things just for disagreeing (which, incidentally, is why internet trolls are childish).'  How's that for an 'answer', Contra?  I'm not sure that really works being turned back at me, though."
"Hey, I have that same knife and that same political ennui!"
"I really like the framed Anita Sarkeesian in the back ground. :)"
"13:20  False equivalence. Silencing through campus or workplace prohibitions are enforced top down, while silencing through the use of hate speech is bottom up. This is a major difference that changes pretty much everything."
"I feel as though you're slowly becoming the David Lynch of Youtube video essayists, and I am 100% on board."
"WRITE AN ABSURDIST PLAY"
"Enjoyed the video, but please stop using 'sjw' non ironically...  That is all."
"This video doesn't even touch upon the real issues of hate speech.  One of the biggest issues is who defines it?  It often doesn't have a clear definition.  Another big issue is someone who is accused of saying hate speech, even if it is only one time, can loose there job, even if it is not a work.  People make mistakes.  People have been blackballed for being accused of one instance of hate speech.  You talk about Rubin not caring as much about the speech of minorities, but the majority of his latest  interviews are with minority women."
"I have to say I find this video distressingly disingenuous. There's a significant difference between calling someone a racist (or whatever) and using noise to disrupt or prevent a speaker from communicating, blocking entrances to a venue, or rioting and getting an event shut down due to security concerns. Those latter examples actually happen - they're not fantasized problems - and I'm pretty sure *those* are the things that are being criticized when classical liberals are criticizing 'the left' for opposing free speech.   The subtle social pressure problem is bad, and I'd like to see it addressed in better ways so that there can be more and better communication between people, but (a) if people on the 'right' are complicit in generating social silencing pressure that doesn't justify people on the 'left' doing the same (as you continue to in your presumption that anyone speaking out against what some women might say must be a misogynist, etc), and (b) there's a certain amount of unavoidable subjectivity in this topic, in that what people feel to be too much social pressure is going to be widely variant and cannot really form the basis for an objective standard for discourse. We should all strive to be as welcoming as possible, but it's not reasonable to expect people to self-censor their opinions so as not to hurt the feelings of the especially sensitive, because that both destroys the autonomy of the opinion holder and provides an exploitable avenue for the unscrupulous to shut down conversation.   Of course, for as many particularly sensitive individuals, there will be some number of more driven individuals who are willing to challenge those sorts of opinions despite the social pressure, and it is those individuals who face physically inhibiting behavior when they attempt to communicate their ideas. But these inhibitions do not appear to be coming from and affecting everyone equally; they appear overwhelmingly to be coming from 'the left' and affecting anyone who does not fall into very strict lockstep with what might be called the progressive or SJW agenda. That you haven't even addressed this is... incredibly disappointing. I'm sorry, but this video is really shallow apologia no better than everyone you're criticizing here."
"It's not about being called racist, we don't care about that, it's about physically not being allowed to speak..."
"The anti free speech argument we make against regressive are directed towards colleges who have unnecessary regulations on who can speak, like no platforming Milo who has some good ideas.  But even bigger, in Europe, plenty of countries silence offensive speech which IS a big problem."
"I was almost kicked out of my university housing because i stood up to a turkish guy who tried to rape my housemate when she was completely blasted, i was called racist by the liberal fucktards in charge of student support because this other guy ran off made out like he was the victim and then showed them a phone conversation with him where i mentioned that he doesnt properly understand english and is misrepresenting the point of an argument i was having with him. I was labelled a racist and threatened by these student support people and i was too scared to bring up the topic again. So what you are saying is that them labeling me as a racist and threatening to kick me out of my home was a 'micro aggression' and that me being silenced and not allowed to voice my opinions is good because i probably shouldnt have been spouting my racist opinions anyway. You are clearly a smart person and you twist these arguments to the point were they almost sound believable. Also as someone who is very tolerant and has never attacked anyone or thought less of anyone due to the color of their skin or their sexual orientation it fucking hurts to be called a racist or a homophobic or anything like that its creating a real us and them situation often over the fact that im just white and straight and to be pushed apart like that is a fucking problem. Why not look at the evergreen college situation and watch all of your arguments fall to pieces when you see what this kind of censorship does to a population of people."
"This is a good take."
"its a micro aggression to be labelled homophobic trans phobic and all of that? people lose their jobs over such claims, look at the evergreen college shit, because white people didnt want to be forced off of a campus they were labelled as racists when they tried to have a discussion they were shouted down to the point were they were unsafe on campus. Jordan petersons argument is that forcing people to use specific language is a dangerous law to put into place because it can easily be abused and isnt well thought out. I think that everyone should have the right to a platform, even a holocaust denier, you can hear their stupid fucking arguments you can see they are a stupid fucking person and act accordingly to the people that are stupid and offend you tough shit suck it up their are some cunts in this world you have to deal with that dont censor the rest of the population who would respect people the plight of these people if not for the fact we are being labelled homophobic transphobic and all that other shit and divided by the people who are bitching about the division. i protect all forms of speech because its fucking words the problem is lack of education and living standards this is what creates ignorant retarded people and guess what the more you sensor people the more you let people hide the less they get educated the more ignorant they get and the more harm they do"
"'Are you sure it wasn't (head tilt) freedom?' lmfao I love you so much."

"I love how you have a color scheme now. Like with the lights and stuff. Pop art-y."
"Finally @ 12:57 If Richard Spencer showed up at your event interrupting and taking over the space then you would have every right to throw him out. After all, it is your venue that you paid for and space that you're hosting. His right to free speech doesn't extend to a right to disturb your event. He can protest outside. Sure. But, let's be honest, that's not what you're talking about. When you say 'deplatforming' you mean stopping his right to hold an event at all, and if he does secure a venue, you feel people have the right to invade and disrupt. That's not supporting his right to speak and those that want to hear him to listen -- which is a lil bit fashy -- wouldn't you agree?"
"@ 10:32 Again, stop with the red herrings. Neither side has special 'protections' to their platforms. If you're a free speech absolutist, as I am, then you recognize that both sides have a general right of protection for their platforms. What you're doing is intellectually dishonest because you're ultimately advocating for allowing one the right of one side to speak  to dampen the right of the other side to speak."
"@ 9:34 -- What percentage of the population are trans? Less than 2% globally (I'm being generous). Why do they deserve the 'privilege' to change societal gender norms that have been around for 1,000s of years? You're misrepresenting Dave Rubin & Jordan Petersen's greater arguments and distilling it down to cis v. trans, racist v. p.o.c., female v. male, etc. to suit your social justice narrative. You lost me at that point. Bottom line, we cannot cater to the fringes of gender norms and have societal order, this doesn't mean we should abuse LGBTQ people, but we should definitely push back against their authoritarian politics."
"This is one of your best videos so far, can't wait for part 2."
"Thank you so much for this video. I have always had a certain contempt for 'classical liberals' like Dave Rubin, however I could not quite articulate why. But you manage to put my thoughts into words, so thank you."
"Another thought provoking video from one of the most handsome YouTuber's on the platform."
"The people who oppose Bill C16 don't do that because they want to protect the freedom of speech for transphobes. You are narrowing down the affected group to include only bad people, when in fact, a good person who accidentally misgenders someone (let's say that the victim and witnesses interpret it as intentional) could be affected by the bill. Trans people can also be negatively affected by the bill, since it defines gender identity as a choice (that some people might want them to simply change) and since it risks making people reluctant to engage with trans people, in fear of saying or doing something that would get them sued.¬† This is pretty much the point of all of this - in your attempt to protect people, you might be hurting them. Also, the affected group is larger than you think. Not everyone who is called a misogynist is a misogynist.¬† You bring up an interesting point, because I think that you are correct that people who play the victim when they're called a racist or something like that, are hypocritical when they at the same time insult people on the other side. I know exactly why they do that, but I'm not sure if everyone of them could articulate it. It isn't really about the insults - it's about the lack of communication. When people make claims about you without allowing you to defend yourself, you feel unjustly treated and powerless. This is why anti-SJWs often say that they will have an interaction with anyone (see for example the response to Laci Green's most recent videos) and despise the SJWs for not doing that.¬† Sometimes, this is used as a justification for insulting them. They say that if you aren't heard, you will try to make a large enough impact to the person you're trying to communicate with, so that the person might hear you. If that isn't the reason, you might do it because you don't expect your post/video to reach the person, so it won't harm anyone, you might conclude. I get why these things occur, but it would be better to try to fight against these instincts and get the message across without using insults.¬† I can't remember the last time I insulted a person directly or indirectly online, but I do enjoy listening to people insult me. That very seldom happens, so I often listen to people who insult a group that I belong to. MGTOWs are fun, they can say things like: 'women should be treated like pets or small children, that would make them feel better and also be better for men'. When I hear that and am able to laugh at it, I feel strong. I am able to laugh at that because I have exposed myself to things like that for a long time. The first time someone insulted me online, I almost cried. That would never happen now.¬† As long as the opportunity to respond exists, a harsh online environment can be beneficial. However, the people who truly want to discuss ideas should be civil if they wish to be taken seriously."
"first time viewer...majority report brought me here...great clip..."
"I love your channel so much."
"The episode where Contra escapes Rawlsian liberalism. RIP overlapping consensus."
"Contra Is so hot üò•"
"The reason you get people defending the rights of people to say anything while not defending people silenced by 'hate speech' is because one is trying to talk the other gave up. They FEEL FEELINGS and those FEELINGS make them not talk. Well, thats not my fucking problem, if they push through and attempt to speak, I will gladly defend their right to speak, but they have to meet me half way. If they are meek enough to be silenced by opinions they are forfeiting their own right to speech.   I take the side of people trying to talk who aren't being allowed to. I don't have time to manage other peoples feelings, but I can defend someone once they've taken the initiative themselves.  I also object to your framing of this as a right wing talking point, some of the most ardent fighters against campus censorship are lefties, who are done with this atmosphere."
"Everyone knows that Hitchens who's last words were 'Death to capitalism', supported Obama, defended gay rights, called for reparations to the descendants of slaves and so much more is the epitome of right-wing thought posing as liberal. Come now."
"13:05 'In effect it is fervently impossible to be consistent...' When I guess we should just throw the whole Freedom of Speech thing out the window. Don't let perfection be the enemy of the good. There will always be a topic that someone finds to far for them, no one is totally stoic. That doesn't mean we should adopt Hate Speech laws.  Government funded schools are De Facto government institutions and are bound why the protections of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, which includes the 1st Amendment. I don't think that the government should write laws violate the freedom of association for private businesses.   The right to Freedom of Association has been trampled by 1965 Civil Rights Act. It has only gotten worse since then. The Freedom of Association also includes the freedom to not associate, which has been continuously undermined for the last 50+ years. Voting Rights should never have been tied to it and were actually addressed by the Constitution, but people chose not to enforce the laws which is why 1965 happened. If people simply applied the laws as they are already written, we wouldn't be in the mess we are in today.  You are on the wrong side me thinks ContraPoints."
"11:45 'Willing to make exceptions' - ContraPoints, Hitchens being a hypocrite on one occasion is not a debunking of Free Speech. The doctor that smokes a cigar while telling you that smoking is bad for your health doesn't mean the doctor is wrong, he might be a hypocrite, but he isn't wrong. So you find one instance of Hitchens not wanting to deal with X opinion is not a total refutation of unlimited Freedom of Speech (minus calls to action(fire in a theater etc...)), so what? Everyone has their own personal biases and limits on what they want to deal with/talk about.  You are talking about social pressures (Gays and Trans feeling marginalized) versus actual hate speech laws, and this is where you and I depart. It is the explicit duty of the government to write no law infringing on a person's right to Freedom of Speech. This applies to every citizen equally, straight or gay, black or white. As soon as you write Hate Speech laws, you have now legalized restrictions on Freedom of Speech. You ContraPoint should be just as vigilant on this issue as Rubin is. Imagine if the Christian fundamentalist took the reigns of power and wrote Hate Speech laws that said you could not criticize Christianity? Would you not be in the streets protesting or writing your congressman? The tools of evil can never be used for good. If you think Hate Speech laws are good for X group, you have now just legalized Hate Speech laws to be used against any group.  It's like the whole Patriot Act and the NSA and other powers that our government has given itself over the years. It was fine when Bush did it, but then republicans cried foul when Obama got into office. And the same damn thing is happening again that Obama is leaving, people are crying foul at Trump. What is good for the goose is good for the gander.  So yeah, deal with it. Free Speech with no compromise. I'm outie."
"Contrapoints plays with the false equivalency of people self censoring because they are scared of people making mean comments and censorship of institutions and or the state. And because these two are essentially the same the solution is the progressive stack and silencing erveryone that is not a black gay lesbian with multiple handicaps and a koran. Amazing show you got there. Have you ever considered the possibility that censoring yourself is your own fault and noone elses? I dont do vids because the thought of one day having the mindless drones of sargon or contrapoints swarming all over me makes my skin crawl. Which is my problem and nobody elses."
"This is definitely something I have to think about, as I both have never been a big fan of free speech, in the sense I describe below, and yet I have been increasingly troubled by the lack of tolerance for speech on the left...although when I say that I only mean 'by left-leaning students at certain universities.'  Full disclosure, I consider myself a 'centrist' by American standards, so I am, likely to the right of you on several issues and it may color my thinking.  On the first point, my defense of American-style freedom of speech has always been less than full throated.  I have always believed that banning Nazis from holding parades is no actual loss of liberty, for example, and that Britain, France, and Germany continue to be free societies without giving license to the batshit crazy elements (which in this sense I am defining merely as the elements that would like them to no longer be free societies for Jews, women, and minorities).  At the fringes, all of those countries have some quirks that I wouldn't endorse (the libel laws in Britain, France criminalizing protests against their nuclear weapons testing and banning displays of religious garb. etc.),  but obvious there is always going to be a line drawing problem when it comes to identifying 'bad speech acts' in a system where you can ban those acts.  There are gray areas...and then there are a few clear cases, like banning Nazi parades in Skokie.  Zero liberty lost in banning that parade because those Nazis had an ideology that was plainly and on its face inconsistent with the rights and liberties Americans enjoy, including the right to free speech.  On the other side, the very day you posted this I became aware of the situation at Evergreen State in Washington, and the students' call to have Professor Bret Weinstein fired (and police telling him it is unsafe for him to return to the campus currently).  It is possible that the stories I have read are all skewed in the professor's favor, but what I gather is that the University has for many years had a day where minority students exempted themselves from class and had off campus discussion of the issues they face.  This year, rather than remove themselves from campus, there was a call for white students to not go to the campus so the minority students could congregate there and (largely) have that space to themselves.  Weinstein, as I understand it, objected to that stating that there is a difference between voluntarily removing oneself from campus and calling on others to leave it.    And then the students lost their minds.  I can see arguing that the professor is wrong.  As long as the choice of white students is free and voluntary and they are not harassed for deciding not to heed the call, I am myself a bit indifferent between the two alternatives.  But I don't think it's an unreasonable argument and I don't see it as racist.  Near as I can tell, Weinstein is really a liberal, who just happened to disagree with the popular sentiment among (some, maybe most) minority students on this one thing.  And now they want him fired and some are threatening his safety.  That is not exactly a microaggression.  If someone were calling for me to be fired, I'd say that was aggression.  Even with my limited defense of free speech, I think you have to tolerate hearing all sorts of ideas you hate.  I think especially so, in a university, you have to let dumb-dumbs speak both so they can be educated and because at 18-22 years old you don't really know what you will come to believe is true in the years ahead, and so exposure to a broad array of ideas can be helpful.  Take the almost indefensible Ann Coulter.  Okay, she hardly ever says anything worth hearing...but in a country where a sizable plurality voted for Trump understanding what those people think is worthwhile.  Even if you disagree with them, it's worthwhile.  While I think we can write off Nazis from the free speech train, we can't write off 48% of Americans as if they were Nazis or fascists unworthy of being heard. (Or, if we can because their views are incompatible from living in a free society, then we need to seriously consider maybe partitioning the country...because 48% is far too many Nazis to live peaceably side-by-side.)    It seems like there is almost a fad of university students (on the left) erupting unreasonably in response to minor offenses like people defending obnoxious Halloween costumes, supporting Trump openly or one group wanting to hear from a right-wing speaker.  Apart from the fact that these incidents have seemed ridiculous to me, I can only imagine how apprehensive teachers must be (left or right) knowing that a misstatement in relation to a controversial topic...or perhaps anything less than full-throated support for ideas that one may not think are the best, and you can get caught up in a shit storm.  That has to have a negative effect on the speech of professors, who want to keep their jobs.  The rational response (or at least what my response would be if I were a college professor) would be to scrub your syllabus of any material that is in any way a passionate response from the left.  That is bad for students who want a full and well-rounded education, but a professor's gotta eat.  So now I feel like I *used* to be a non-supporter of the crazy American First Amendment, who is constantly drawn into supporting free speech by the actions of students on university campuses over the past few years.  But as you say, giving speech rights to Ann Coulter takes them away from the students who want to protest against her.  I feel like you can have both, but maybe you can't.    I don't want to support Ann Coulter, but I still do want to support Professor Weinstein and the Christakises at Yale.  In fact, I kind of feel like supporting them (maybe even Coulter) is *good* for the students I'd have to oppose because in a university they are better off hearing the disagreeable speech and learning from it (even if all they learn are the arguments that many wrongheaded people in this country are making).  Of course, that sounds incredibly paternalistic, and it is, but I am ultimately glad for the crazies I head to hear from at college, and I know that I did not have enough perspective when I was in college to predict that.  Maybe I am wrong.  And that is a problem because if I am wrong, left-wing students will not only tell me I am wrong, they will want me fired or worse!  I will close by quickly noting that it's not just the left.  When Rebecca Watson objected to being cornered in an elevator, I was and continue to be stunned by the reaction that got.  The reaction Anita Sarkeesian gets is also baffling.  I get that maybe one disagrees (although I don't get it with Watson's gently saying 'Hey guys, don't do that') with what's being said, but the mob mentality of the subsequent overreaction is strange.  People can say and believe things I disagree with, but usually I just ignore them.  If Sarkeesian ever seems like she in in a position to kill a video game that I really want to play, I will be out there arguing against her,  but no one is redesigning any game based solely on her criticisms (or, if they are, it's likely because the backlash against her made her famous)."

"2:53 'Surely, no one can accuse me of strawmanning'  12:10 'Anyone who wants to say anything abusive about or to me is quite free to do so'  What he actually says in this speech  'Anyone who wants to say anything abusive about or to me is quite free to do so. Is actually welcome in fact, at their own risk'  So you completely strawmanned him since you made a shortened clip of his speech that made his intent look different and said it was his argument."
"Humm, im a big fan of Dave Rubin and i think you should go on his show. You do make some pretty good points about him choosing a side whether or it was a conscious decision or not.  You covered some on Deplatforming, but no mention of trigger warnings and hate speech (is that in part 2?)  I do find it funny tho - your comments section is a joke, tho arguably, you must feel similar looking at his."
"Yet, I call straw man. As a long-time fan, recommender, and financial supporter of your content this video is especially disappointing for me to watch. You reduce opposing authoritarian pc behavior to insisting maniacs like Richard Spencer get a platform. You must know that all of these anti-leftist articles exist for different reasons (you bring them up yourself in other videos). The lack of honesty on this point gave me physical discomfort. But yes, thank you for alerting people to the suppressions of free speech imposed on marginalized groups by hate speech; this is not discussed enough."
"This is the best channel on YouTube right now or at least among the top in terms of quality and substance -- the fact that videos like this get 1/6th of the views of right wing garbage on YouTube shows that quality has no necessary relationship to views on subs on YouTube.¬† When the profit motive is involved the system rewards placating people's immediate wants rather than needs. Dumber, more facile content is rewarded while anything that attempts to push boundaries especially in intellectual discourse has a harder time.  This is also a big reason why ridiculous prank channels get millions of views while more robust and experimental intellectual or political content doesn't. The system doesn't reward refining human instincts or providing people's intellectual or educational needs it rewards immediate base desires and wants.  Not to sound stuffy but it's really annoying and insulting that these right wing hacks hold themselves in such high regard when it's obvious that they are child's play compared to a lot of the leftist channels on YouTube."

"At around 8:50 you talk about how some kinds of speech suppress other types of speech (with the examples being words like 'racist' 'islamophobe' and so on being used  to effectively silence some people and abusive comments effectively silencing women, trans people, etc on youtube) and you say that at some point you have to decide which side you're on. I actually disagree quite strongly here. To me, the more internally consistent positions would be to either allow both types of speech, or to disallow both of them. That is, you either allow people to attempt to silence others using social pressure or you don't. Personally, I've always leaned more towards thinking you should allow both (though that's largely because I don't see any effective way to police against either).   I'll concede the point that this isn't an entirely neutral position, in that one has to make a choice between allowing suppression through social pressure or not, but I do think that allowing people to attempt to use social pressure to suppress the speech of others (regardless of who they are and who is being suppressed) isn't inherently politically biased. Do you disagree? If so, I would be interested to hear why."
"'THE LEFT IS DESYTORYING FREE SPEECH... AND I'VE WRITTEN DOZENS OF BOOKS AND  ARTICLES WITHOUT ISSUE TO PROVE IT!!!!'"
"why is it wrong to admit the left has problems and we need to address them and fix them."
"Ooooh yeah, i will send thil video to every liberal i hear complaining about the left hindering free speech. Thank you!"
"There seems to be a false equivalency here about free speech 'denials' from the left and the right.      If you are hearing from the right that labeling someone a racist or a NAZI is tantamount to silencing someone it is being done to point out that doing so is nothing more than an ad hominem attack.   The criticism isn't in that you are not allowed to do it, the criticism lies in that you have done nothing to address or counter the issues expressed.    You are just trying to silence that person.    So you can be a believer in freedom of speech and still be critical of someone that does nothing more than ad hominem attacks.       This is different than an attempt to de-platform and actually silencing particular points of view you might find offensive.   If anyone from the right is doing that I would be equally critical of that.        The main supportive argument from the left in de-platforming people is that in doing so it creates a safe environment for marginalized that would otherwise not feel emboldened to do so.    The problem with that is who decides who are the marginaized groups?   Is this being used as a front to propagate an ideology you agree with.    Is it being used to silence an ideology you disagree with and giving marginalized voices more of a voice has nothing to do with it?"
"A more surreal clip would have been them opening their mouth to make the noise of a phone ringing"
"I think that a good point to make is that free speech is a means to an end, not an end in and of itself. The alt-right seems to treat freeze peach (not to be confused with free speech, freeze peach is the idea that you should always be able to say anything wherever, even if it only serves to harm others; where free speech exists to protect people, freeze peach exists to attack people) as an end. Free speech (whether in the legal or informal sense) is only useful as long as it helps people assert their rights in some ways; once it metamorphoses into freeze peach and becomes a harmful influence, it's no longer desirable. That being said, I generally think social pressures are the best way to fight hate speech altogether, given that legal restrictions (e.g. against workplace discrimination, or the ludicrous Nazi imagery laws in Germany) seem to be pretty poor at actually protecting people from bigotry."
"9:50 I think he said that in relation to his critique to religion, and how all those voices get oppressed by said religions. I think his point was that defending religion goes in direct contrast to defending 'fags, Jews, slaves and their descendants'. At least that's how I understand it."
"Okay, since I live in Germany I haven't seen your blocked video, so I can't be sure. But I think that those Nazis used YouTube's banning policies to their advantage (similar to all those false copyright claims) rather than what you did being actually illegal. At least in Germany you CAN display Nazi symbols for both educational and artistic purposes. And from watching your other videos I assume that this specific video would fall into those categories."
"and homophobic, transphobe is A REACTION TO SPEECH. being homophobic is not.   'dear imagined person with -+phobic views (or not but who is espousing 'ironic bullshit' i can't detect because I cant mindread and I prefer to not be long enough to see whether you want to break my nose in earnest or are 'Just joking')  dear imagined homophobe  if you say something homophobic, I will call what you said homophobic.    If you call me a 'freak' or a fugly dyke or a perverted fag, you are not criticizing my speech. You are attacking me as a person.   (you are also enforcing a negative opinion about my being, something I don't chose, a reaction I didn't ask for because you feel that forever reason you can attack someone for who they are without any fear for retaliation.. in a backdrop of people murdering people who stand up for the right of others to not be harassed and attacked in public, btw. )  You attacking me as a person. I attack your speech.  see the difference?  The attack also repeats often legal oppression, violence, a lack of accessibilities that other people will never even have to fear, so it attacks someone for what they are..  so yeah.. attack me? well pull a fucking nr and go stand in the queue to attack m beeing, while you can whine that other people will find that distasteful and will exercise their speech to criticize yours. You are clearly the victim here."
"somebody's been watching twin peaks season 3 ;)"
"This was a good video, but the most people who are against deplatforming dont say that you have to give every opinion a voice on your private platform. The Law shouldnt prohibit anyone from speaking nor should they be banned from public places like a university. And incitement to violence should of course be never allowed.  The problem is also what can be defined as hate speech. Christina Hoff Summers was deplatformed on universities and even Rubin himself. Please tell me how their speech is dangerous."
"I seriously disagree with you. You are making free-speech into a zero-sum game and it's not. Being discouraged from speaking up in public for trans issues (left) or being discouraged from publicly displaying hateful views on muslims (right) is not a free speech issue. Or else you would say, that being discouraged from spouting racism by being accused as such is 'stifling free speech'. If using your argument consequently, you are arguing, that political correctness and a backlash against racism is censorship, because it discourages people from speaking their mind. The only reason why you don't follow this logic is that you aren't consequentual in it"
"You pronounce everything with the fourth tone."
"Your second clip of Hitchens and your subsequent point was a strawman.   You know for a fact that Hitchens is referring to the holocaust denier's right to deny it without imprisonment or legal punishment. It's an important distinction which I can only conclude that you have deliberately obfuscated.   Disappointing tbh."
"that's just a wiccan tapestry hanging upsidedown on the wall isn't it? the border's all wrong for satanic."
"Most of the somewhat valid points are lost when you do things like saying minorities listening to a holocaust denier are 'taking abuse'. I used to love your stuff, and your Golden One and RooshV videos are some of the best shit I've seen on youtube, but lately each of your videos seems to increase the bullshit to funny and smart ratio. It seems to me that you are slowly descending into some ideological abyss, and increasingly easy to see cracks and spot non-sequitur as time goes on.  If you want to die on that hill, it's your choice, but for me each video has less arguments and more faith pumped into it.  Wish you the best, keep up the fun."

"all speach should be listend to. discussion, facts checking and talking ratonaly is the way to find truth and understanding.  For example the hate speach lawsuit against David Irving a philosopher who denied the holacaust. witch i will be completly honest am only aware of the situatuon because of the film denial. im unsure of how acuratly the film portrayed all of the characters since it is a movie thats goal is to be entertaining. I will write this with the perspective that the movie is 100% acurare to make it esayer to explain my stance. movie shows how hate speach should be handled. At the begining of the film Deborah Lipstadt before the slander lawsuit against her from David Irving she would yell at anyone who asked a 'stupid questions'  asking her to show evidance that the holacaust happend she would shut down all discussion with them and yell at them and belittle there character insted of giving facts. She would often call David Irving a stupid man and saying he was not a credible philosopher David Irving eventuly sued Deborah Lipstadt for slander of his character when she decided no to settle and fight his slander claim the lawsuit became the halocaust happend and David Irving was not slander or the haulacaust didn't happen and Deborah Lipstadt is slandering him for saying he was barly a philosopher for not beliving in it in the cort case Deborah Lipstadt won and did not have to face slander charges and aushwits was oficaly under the cort of law proven to be a nazi phucility that was renovated into a gas chamber David Irving's career as a philosopher to a major hit and manny of his supoters after the verdict turned away from his work.  Tldr..  The moral being the descusion of all oppinions in a fact based argument (or lawsuit) is the only way to have people realise witch side has the most truth yelling fuck you the holacaust happend and i wont hear anything else didn't destroy the numbers the holacaust deniers had the lawsuit the facts and the disscusions did."

You can't honestly defend these tactics, and when the other side does it, it's just as deplorable. But ofc let's focus on the real important issue of uAggressions.  EDIT: I just love the options: you can either support: women, or misogynists, people of color or racists :D Because no person of color, or women ever said something you can take issue with.

"now that isnt to say that the left is against free speech. it is to say that everyone gets down with a self serving bias every now and again. really i am saying that we all dont want to hear certain thing we disagree with. the thing is when you give a group the right to sensor another, tensions will build. i view it more like this. the president of any given nation and i will just use myself as an example here, have the same amount of authority,  just fewer people recognize my authority. we are all humans and part of being human, apart from like isaac newton and neil degras (im sure my spelling is wrong but its late here) and other robot people, is that we are all capable of error. instead of censoring free speech we must look to hear what is said, how else could we ever change our minds. not a nazi and i live in the south so im working on the racism, and a third gender biosex male attracted to men here, but i still want to hear all the sides to any story, because life is too short to leave a story untold. :)"
"why _can't_ you be consistent and neutral, though?  Why can't you host both a holocaust survivor and a neonazi holocaust denier and listen to them both equally and decide which one is full of shit?

(Granted, you'd need to know a _fuckton_ of stuff and be ready to outsmart and outpace all the toughest bullshitters that the world has to offer, but can't that be done?)

"are you trying to get a great philosopher or why do you drink so much? You're just gonna be a lovely thinker but a bugger when you're pissed."
"I'm not sure it's quite a fair comparison to contrast college social pressure with internet social pressure. I mean for one: college social pressure tends to also be bundled policy based consequences. And your college experience is probably the largest financial investment anyone at that stage of their life has made in their entire life, on which they are gambling their future career prospects. If you can't take the heat, give up and walk away with 20 grand in student loan debt and nothing to show for it. That's institutional power.  The internet is basically the world wide community center cork board where anyone and everyone can stand on a soapbox behind a pseudonym and spout whatever bullshit ideas they have and pretend they're having any effect on the world pissing into an ocean of piss. The only thing you're really putting at risk is your ego.  Fundamentally I disagree with Hitchens that ANY ideas or groups should get special protections or consideration in terms of speech (though I would say they're good edge cases to watch for and stress testing your principles). Ideas should stand on their own merits, regardless of who says them, who they offend, or how similar they feel to ideas socially considered to be wrong. Any social pressure we have should be spent divorcing ideas from the individuals. Cracking down on and mocking the shit out of people when they rely on the ad-homeneim in lieu of substantive refutation. This way we can treat ideas with the absolute savagery necessary to Darwinian meritocracy while remaining civil enough with the actual individuals expressing those ideas.  This is what drew me to the absolute clusterfuck of places like reddit, the chans & youtube comments sections. You're already basically anonymous, there is no individual to be considered, no one can just trump you out of credibility by being anyone of relevance. We've all just accepted that we're all degenerates & morons... EQUALITY! Now there's only an idea, and your ability to tear it apart (plus whatever collateral emotional damage is inflicted on whoever got emotionally attached to a lie). What makes these kinds of places hostile to people with marginalized identities, is the fact that they brought their identity into this ecosystem. And the only value that move would have is in trying to undermine that pure idea based banter by trying to validate your opinion via your lived experience or some other aspect of your identity. It's a power grab for moral authority."
"the scotch gag made me lol."
"I don't like watching interesting videos that I disagree with. I've just spent an hour writing 7 or 8 paragraph long responses, they were all bad, and in order to make a good response it would need to be a fucking essay, nobody would read it, and I would need to re-watch the video two or three times, and take notes, to form properly articulated arguments. This is why people only watch stuff they agree with, watching things you disagree with just leads to impotent rage unless you can fully form complex counterarguments on the fly(witch I can't), and express them well in writing(I'm also bad at this). meanwhile if I already agreed with this, I would feel little compulsion to comment, and if I still wanted to, I could just write some shitty one sentence straw-man, and that would be that."

"Free speech is a good principle that, like every other principle, requires reasonable/common sense exceptions. Anyone pretending to be a free speech absolutist, or pretending to be perfectly neutral, is a dishonest fuck with a hidden agenda. At least leftists don't pretend to be free speech absolutists. It's centrists and right-wingers that are guilty of that particularly insidious deception."
"Your videos are amazing! üôÇ"
"He makes Chinese sound so good."
"Everyone hates free speech of their enemies. Whoever has control over the media and the narrative will censor what they can get away with censoring. The 'Left' (more like teenage cunts and fags who roleplay leftism) had control, but its losing it. Now we can see the right cheering for the 'censorship' of islam apologists , for that red haired hag who made the mock asassination of trump.... nothing new under the sun boys   'the left' would say 'RACISM AND MISOGINY IS NOT FREE SPEECH', the right says 'TERRORISM IS NOT FREE SPEECH!'. Its the same. And dont fucking touch muh christopher hitchens bro, he is a god."
"Contra is far far faaaaar more equipped with logic/rhetoric than Dave Rubin"
"Not being in favor of the government taking away someones platform =/= this person must be given a platform to express their opinion.  Now is that so hard to understand?"
"I don't like Dave Rubin's, let people say whatever they want unchallenged, approach either. *BUT* the concern in regards to hate speech is that simply disagreeing with someone is now being labeled as hate speech by some on the far left. And this tactic, to try and get someone fired from their job because they said something you don't like, or made a joke you found offensive.  People are defending Richard Spencer because they see it as the far left trying to open an avenue of control. Once it's okay to shutdown and attack the actual racist Spencer, then it will be okay to do the same to all those they've labeled a racist as well.   Look at what's going on at Evergreen right now. Despite me not liking Rubin, so far it's only been him and Tucker Carlson that have interviewed him. Why are we giving assholes like Tucker Carlson the moral high ground here? Where is the MSM outrage over this insanity? People like to say, the Left eat's it own. And everyone apparently forgot, *the Right already ate it's own*. It's called the Tea Party. It's part of why Donald Trump is president. So what the hell is going to be the Left version of this if we allow it to continue unchallenged? If we allow an entire generation to be completely turned off of the idea of being a 'liberal' for its association with this regressive crap?"
"love this!! thank you contra"
"interesting costume changes throughout :3"
"please, don't sully the memory of Hitchens by attaching his positions to someone like Rubin... the human version of a soapbox for right wingers...aka Milo light, the rights new, less offensive token gay guy.  @ 10:15  and  to anyone who cares about not being rather disingenuous, go listen to the ENTIRE sentence that Hitchens was speaking from that free speech debate.   He was making a point about how the ones often calling for censorship of speech, being the religious, are hypocrites because of what they and their holy texts say about the treatment of slaves, women, gays etc.       please don't pluck out a 1/3rd of a sentence and spin it to make it looks like he is being a dick toward women and minorities, because in reality, Hitchens was constantly and consistently standing up for women and minorities in the face of theocracies that sought to mistreat them.    Hitchens view on free speech is...or rather was, simple...  His definition is far reaching because he doesn't trust anyone with the responsibility of determining what speech is too harmful to hear.   Its an excellent point, Who should we trust to decide what we can and can not hear ? and what is deemed 'harmful' ?  should it be those in power like Trump ? should it become illegal to hurt a conservatives feelings?  we would all be in jail.  Should it be the majority ? no, you lose again.  And anyone pretending that they know best, or that a consensus of the country already knows, shouldnt be trusted to do so either."
"Destiny is caaaallllling me open up my eaaaaagerrrrr eyeeeeeees"

"This like a 7 paragraph response, sorry for the length. I've got a few problems with your arguments so far. First, I don't accept the assumption that you have to choose sides sooner or later when it comes to how we treat the ability to speak at some point. This is foundation for the rest of your argument, and you didn't really establish it well.   For example, I can oppose both the deplatforming of people I despise on the right like Ann Coulter and Milo and also attempts to de-platform a person on the left like Linda Sarsour in her upcoming appearance at CUNY(Though I am also not a huge fan of her for different reasons). Can you explain your reasoning on this a bit more? The idea that allowing someone like Milo to speak is going to somehow silence minority voices is rather absurd. The huge protests that break out in response to people like Milo or Coulter coming to give a trollish talk clearly demonstrate this to be false. They opposition made their opinion loud and clear(while ironically giving them and their message more attention then he ever would have received had the protesters not tried to silence them).  ¬†I know you said would address de-platforming directly later, but you did bring it up in the video. Would it not be far more productive to protest his message and his opinions, ask tough questions, or hold an alternate counter event? Hell, where is the benefit to de-platforming them? All it seems to do is give ammo and sympathy and global attention to Milo and his ilk, who then gleefully portray the left as bullies.   I do agree that social norms are inevitably going to have a de-facto silencing affect, I think there is no way around that. But that is just the natural effect of holding any minority position. This does not mean I have to suddenly choose sides and decide who should speak based on if they disagree with me or not. Why not let them speak their piece, and then tear into their opinion should you disagree? And when it comes Rubin and co's opposition to the left just decrying everyone as racist or whatever, I do think there is a legit  point that you missed here.   On Hitchens, you did a pretty good job demonstrating him being a hypocrite via his treatment of that 9/11 truther.   But that clip you took of Hitchens on the women, minorities,  tribes, etc. was completely out of context. I've watched that whole debate.   @10:28 He was directly responding to an argument made by the previous speaker who tried to guilt the audience in supporting a anti-hate speech proposal because gays and minorities are just too weak to handle it. You portray it as if he is attempting to silence gays or women or tribes(as if you either support one or the other), but how is he doing that? Currently (in the US) few are attempting to craft policies that seek to stifle and silence the ability of minority(racial/Sexual) voices to speak. And on Campuses at the very least, left leaning people are by far the ones who get to set those social norms.   And something I think you failed to really address is Hitchen's other point. Stifling unpopular speech prevents others from actually examining their own position and strengthening it. How do we know the holocaust happened? Well most are just told so. Hearing a denier is likely to prompt others to go find the mountain of evidence proving that yes the Holocaust did indeed occur.   Finally, people like Hitchens because he is very eloquent, fiery, and very well read, and was likely the best debater around when he was alive. Writing him and his abilities off as a self righteous douche with a British accent, . .  while sort of cheekily portraying yourself in a similar self righteous light(@8:16, come on) coupled with weird artistic interlude is a bit rich."
"I'll believe that the right is open to ideological debate when Rubin invites chairman Bob Avakian on his show"
"I'm so deep in the memes I honestly couldn't tell if you were saying 'free speech' or 'freeze peach'"
"Great video. I simply hate when free speech is not defended as the right to criticize authority or speak out against genuine oppression and it's instead invoked to slut shame minors on social media, or call people racial slurs or assert they should be 'gassed'. I mean, I'm not going out on a limb here, but I don't think that's what the liberty and goodness of free speech represents."
"I think you misunderstood Hitchen's point about marginalized views. He wasn't talking about especially protecting views that people merely find ridiculous, but protecting views that people might want to silence by force or fiat. As has been said, free speech isn't for talking about the weather. It's only necessary when someone wants to silence you. It's the same reason that firehoses are available to anyone who needs them but are only used to put out fires."
"There are plenty of legitimate situations of those 'speech microaggression', as well as some 'speech superaggressions' coming from leftist that many people face. All of those channels, Dave Rubin, etc, point them out, and are right about them. Their general narrative of 'freedom of speech being under siege!' being exagerated and wrong doesn't mean they don't speak the  truth anywhere.  You do realize even liberals and leftists themselves get caught up in this? Recently even a super liberal Bernie-voter professor got called 'racist', 'bigot', and got a mob wanting to fire him at Evergreen College. He's not a homophobe, he's not a racist. What 'side' is he on? What 'side' are the people that sympathize with him and condemn the students on?  Why should you pick a side, when there are no 'sides' in reality? This contrived model is not sufficient to accurately assess the issue. Making a video such as this, while also making a mockery out of Rubin (and other such people), perpetuates that system. I see this video and also see bias, misrepresentation, and as part of the 'cultural war'."
"This misses the point.  He completely ignores the rash of people being deplatformed from their lectures at universities through violence.  Riots at berkley to deplatform milo, thugs attacking charles murray and injuring his friend while they  were trying to leave.  these things are happening all the time and it's always the regressive left doing it.  Garrauntee you Hitch never physically assaulted a speaker at a university because he disagreed with him.  So you're whole argument that Liberals and regressives are morally equivilant is poor."
"this christian guy was jailed in indonesia for questioning a quran verse... I think we should raise  better children than getting the government silencing free speech.  i'm not for attacking people, just ideas.  youtube also is censoring rightwing and some promoting gay channels."
"I unsubscribed from Dave Rubin after watching a Dinesh D'Souza interview from I believe a year ago. During the conversation Rubin took several opportunities to mock Reza Aslan in what appeared to be a vain attempt to relate to his guest, who seemed (as Dinesh always does) disinterested in anything that does not serve directly to martyr himself and those who think like him.  I mean in no way to imply that Reza Aslan is undeserving of mockery nor that he is anything aside from a fuckface... but like, who the fuck would take time to speak ill of someone who basically amounts to 'kind of irritating' when literally sitting across from someone who is as pristine an example conceivable of a reprehensible pseudo-intellectual apologist bigot that we have available to us? Dumb.  Dinesh D'Souza makes Reza Aslan look like Daniel Dennett"
"Knot me laoshi OwO"
"The left doesn't hate free speech, but the authoritarian leftist types simply value free speech less than they value their brand of social order and harmony.  They're no different than authoritarian social conservatives in that regard."
"Good analysis, comrade. Keep it up. Out the barrel of a gun indeed."
"I'm not as persuaded by this one as I usually am. There's some equivocation going on, probably accidental, by both yourself and Hitchens.   I doubt, for example, that Hitchens would fail to defend the right of a news network or student group to host a 9/11 Truther. I think the distinction he would *feel*, even if he never articulated it, is between 'formal' speech, such as that presented in books, speeches, etc., with proper respect for decorum and the rules of conduct in the social space, and interruptive speech, e.g., bad questions or protests that drown out a speaker. I doubt he would defend, as another example, the right of a government censor to interrupt a speech via a threat of state violence, even though that is a type of speech as well.   I would have enjoyed a more direct explanation of the difference between speech that presents a point of view in a forum, and speech that attempts to distract from the subject of a forum, or to interrupt its participants. I think that the *principled* objectors to student protests, de-platforming, and hate speech object to those methods of expression not because of a tacit endorsement of any given speaker, but because those forms of speech seem like attempts either to change the norms of forums like college campuses‚Äîsuch that they allow for narrower expression of 'formal' speech‚Äîor in some cases they perceive these actions by the left as *purely interruptive* speech.   I'm sad that you've grown large enough that you might not see every comment anymore, because I really hope you can address these objections to your argument, if not here then in a future video."
"I love your new A E S T H E T I C color palette."
"Well done."
"You know that everyone gets hate on the internet, right? I'm one of those evil 'cis-white-men' and I've still gotten plenty of death threats."
"I actually don't mind homophobes being homophobic around me even though I'm gay. Let it all out, homopobes, be honest so that we can talk. If I silence a homophobe because I didn't (very justifiably) like his homophobic ideas, I'm responsible not just for suppressing free speech (fuck that tbh who cares), but for the fact that I let his false ideas go unchallenged. By silencing them we give them confidence, give them the impression that we have nothing more than yelling in their response. If that person ends up being a shitty parent to their gay kid, there's a real chance that it's on me.  And to be completely honest in my experience people who scream at the top of their lungs at racists/sexist/homophobic/transphobic people aren't POC/women/queer, they're overcompensating allies that think it's a productive thing to do. People who actually experience all those things are much more composed, keep it cool and they can take it because it's our life, if we got outraged every time someone is being a bigot we'd run out of energy really fast. It's not a good thing that we eventually grow a thick skin, but in practice it happens anyway regardless of whether or not people think it should.   What's funny is that allies are the people who really aren't supposed to be outraged, we are, but in practice it's the reverse, and we end up getting the reputation for being thin-skinned in the end. They're not directly affected by it so they shouldn't be emotional about it and yet, here we are.  So I say yeah, have your absolute freedom of speech, as long as you have the balls to say it to the face of the people who you're talking about. At least that's how I prefer things to be for homophobia/Islamophobia because that's what I'm targeted for.  Let's face it, these ideas will be circling around for a long time if not forever, because even though yes, there are countless arguments against them, they float around on the internet and uneducated people get exposed to them. So instead of silencing them we have to face them. Probably forever, because 14 year old kids on the internet don't have a database containing all the counter arguments for all the wrong ideas. And it's sad because it'll be a constant effort forever probably. We'll never fully get rid of all these various flavors of bigotry, and we may cast momentary doubts about the ideas of equality and social justice by even bringing up the fact that the belief that they aren't valid still exists, but the alternative is to silence people and let shitty ideas grow unopposed."
"can't we have both though? Yes, hate speech can suppress the speech of those hated, just as speech from lgbt individuals and ethnic minorities can suppress the speech of the hateful... so why not give both an equal platform? You can create a space for both without suppressing or silencing someone. If I had to wager, I would say there are many more minorities than there are fascists, so wouldn't the ruling ideology end up being informally anti-hate-speech anyways?  btw ily contrapoints, u beautiful beautiful homo. i would absolutely love to see your youtube channel with some lizard lady pegging you while you recited your spiels."

"so years ago I confused christopher hitchens for joseph heller and in a library I found hitchens's book about dying of cancer and I was like 'Oh shit, the author of catch-22 wrote a book about what it was like to die, good times' and then I got very very confused why so much of the book was about hating religion because it had never been a part of his work before."
"Starting the video now... will he cherrypick the few sane leftists and gloss over and excuse the anti-free speech mass movements? will he use phrases like 'only a few teenagers on tumblr' or 'just a campus thing'? find out... in the edit!  edit: uh, no... he doesn't actually discuss the consensus Left position on free speech at all.   I appreciate the good faith attack on the Hitchens/Rubin position, but I don't buy it. The chilling effect that comes from threats of violence and threats of being denied a livelihood is qualitatively not the same as being made uncomfortable or offended. Today, the former is nearly *only* used by the left to punish moral trangressions, and the former is probably spread around equally (but I'll concede it may be worse for marginalized groups). The only group that can punish moral trangressions with ostracism and loss of status/employment is the moral authority, which since around 2011 has been the progressives. Any group can threaten violence, but only those alligned with moral authority will have their actions excused and justified. This is why right wing protesters are generally well behaved and left wing protesters can act like brownshirts. Anyone can make anyone else feel like shit of course, but that isn't the same thing as being materially punished for expressing an idea."

"7:00  Mircoscopic in the way that it is not a *real* restriction, yes, but it does have a big impact. The criticisms of the refugee crisis have been delayed for quiet a while (I'd say that it improved a lot and I am including the mainstream media and leftists), because in countries like Germany or Sweden political correctness is on steroids   7:05   I don't understand that. A microagression is (from how I understand it) a question like 'where are you from?', which implies that the person receiving the question is a foreigner and for some reason it is bad for a foreigner to hear this, which is why we should avoid using sentences like this.   If my example above is correct, then I'd argue that the concept of microagressions *is* creating political correctness.  7:25  *small acts* like my example above? No.   7:40  I don't view a bearing video (this is the most common example, right?) or a SJW cringe compilation as misogynistic or transphobic. In the same video making fun of the Daily Stormer is not anti-white (even if they would claim so).  You just have unpopular opinions and people are gonna make fun of people they disagree with. Having unpopular opinions can have a silencing effect, yes, but I completely disagree that this unpopularity is based on sexism or transphobia.  I'd advise these people to do the same the right does:   stay anonymous  8:15  You are leaving out something tho.   People on the Classical Liberals (god, I hate that term) or people on the right *tend* to be in favor of discussing and debating, while people on the rest of the left *tend* to stay away from discussion (this is also changing tho)  One side wants to stay ideologically pure and *tends* to call people outside of this ideology slurs or even discourages them from speaking in other ways.  The other side desperately wants to convince the other side, is open to discussion and wants the debate to happen.  ... I don't think I would mind as much being called a racist, if the person giving me the accusation was open to a discussion. The label 'racist' is only used to demonize opposition and stop the discourse.   And people like Dave Rubin or Tim Pool end up talking to right wingers most of the time, because no people on the left wants to talk to them. It is just a very very different mentality among the camps  9:10  Again, you are basing this of the statement that racism discourages a black person from speaking. You have no established that   A) There is rampant sexism, racism, etc B) This is silencing people  You have only established that people don't like unpopular opinions and might give feedback to this.   Also: Is Black Hitler discouraging me from making Youtube Videos? Or is this a one way street?"

I don't even mean that in a jokey way; I see a lot of people commenting that they find him to be very desirable, personally I feel the same way, but I'm wondering why? I wouldn't have thought this many people would be so attracted to a person presenting like she does. (I should specify I don't mean to be rude, I to find him to be very attractive in that kind of whole-being type of way, I just didn't think so many would share that view.) (Also 'presenting' may be the wrong word but I do not know the correct one)"

Evey thing else is more or less etiquette and as this video notes there are positive and negative aspects when choosing where to draw the line, to be blind to that is currently the worst sin of the political right."

"Contrapoints I agree with you most of the time, but I think you've missed a crucial point when you say that people who disproportionately defend conservatives' free speech have 'chosen their side'. As a left-winger, this is not why. It is because the vast majority of de-platforming, student riots etc. are targeted at conservatives. If there were an equal number of conservative students storming lecture theatres and physically preventing people from attending left-wing talks, I would blast them just as much, maybe even more (but in my time at uni I have never seen that happen). Have you considered that the reason conservatives get defended more is simply because they get targeted for de-platforming more?"
"I thought the point of Peterson's protest is that bill C16 in Canada makes it a crime to misgender someone now which restricts peoples freedom of speech. This video said he's just arguing to protect hate speech."
"6:38 These are all false dichotomies, a ‚Äúsilencing effect‚Äù is not the same as being denied a platform that people gave you, or you created with your own resources. You need to replace all the phobias, racist, misogynist and so on, with ‚Äúanyone that disagrees with me.‚Äù That‚Äôs why it has no silencing effect. I would like you to show me any ‚Äúconservatives‚Äù or ‚Äúclassic liberals‚Äù that are attempting to shut down anyone flinging these terms in the same way, not self-silencing. It‚Äôs just not possible for everyone to accommodate creating an environment that everyone feels ‚Äúsafe‚Äù to speak, without banning all criticism of what they say.    Hitchens was not saying, give hate speech special privileges to promote it, it was to expose it. To allow it to march right down the middle of main street so that everyone could jeer. It‚Äôs not ‚Äútaking a side‚Äù to defend the speech that‚Äôs being told to shut up. And not allowing someone to interrupt your platform is not silencing their free speech. Get your own platform."

"The problem with this is that some activists will label something as hate speech without merit, and use that as an excuse to shut people down. For an example, talking about websites like Kotaku being too close to the people who they cover is not hate speech, but it was labeled as such to shut down the conversation."
"The left and nothing but the left so help me libtard."
"This reminds me... (I swear this is relevant) a bit over a month ago it was ANZAC Day in Australia, which is the anniversary of an event in wwi where a lot of Australian soldiers died and it was the first time Australian soldiers had really fought overseas as Australians... it's become a sort of founding myth of Australian identity. On ANZAC day we commemorate this and reflect on all the Australians who have died serving in the military. A lot of people on the left think that what we actually do on that day is romanticise war and celebrate the military, rather than reflect on its tragic consequences like we should.  It's also a sort of thing where people perform their (usually hypermasculine) Australian identity and show their Aussie pride, which in this county always has connotations of excluding other groups like racial minorities and women because history. Anyway, there was a journalist for our national broadcasting company who posted on her PERSONAL Facebook page 'lest we forget' (the standard thing to say on anzac day) followed by something like '(Syria, Palestine...).' Just naming three or four other areas of conflict in the world, I don't remember exactly what it was. But then all the right wing nutsos who are in the habit of defending their 'right' to say racist shit in the name of free speech and think that the left is out to censor them were up in arms about this, saying that it was totally inappropriate and disrespectful and indicative of the media's left-wing agenda and that the journalist should lose her job over this!"
"I'm watching the video and responding to it in this comment piece-by-piece, without prior knowledge of what will come before. This will be kind of a long comment and there will be no tl;dr. If you don't wish to read, then don't.  The left *is* trying to silence people. Look at what has happened to speakers invited to Berkeley. College students are being expelled for expressing the wrong views and teachers are being threatened with firings just for using certain texts in classes. Even Obama said this was a problem and it needs to stop. You're making fun of a lot of headlines but I don't see you looking at any of the actual articles or their sources. Granted I'm only 40 seconds in, but so far you haven't made an incredible case for your position.  I like mockery as much as the next person, and this may be your intent, but unless all you're trying to do is rally your base, this hasn't been an effective video so far. A minute in and it's been nothing but mockery, no actual argument made.  Free speech, I wouldn't even say Hitchens would have said that a speaker should have the right to a platform, more that giving many speakers a platform (or more accurately, many ideas) serves a particular kind of intrinsic good, and this position goes well beyond simple rights and freedoms that are protected by laws. So far, I don't really have an issue with your analysis of Hitchens' position.  'Where we disagree, is in which speakers need special protection.'  I think I know where you're going with this (I'm at 4:57 now) and I'm going to say in advance that Hitchens' defined what views needed the most protection, as the ones that were the least widely-held, but that did not mean he didn't also believe that other ideas shouldn't be heard; his stance was clearly that we needed to hear all ideas."
"Can't seem to comment? Appears to be too long."
"Goddammit, the absurdism. I love it.  But can I just add to the 'picking sides' distinction - to protect the right to speech of people with certain oppressive perspectives over the marginalized groups whose speech they inevitably silence is less defensible, I think, when you ask 'whose identity is at stake by speaking or being silenced?'   If an LGBT person, a person of colour, a Muslim or a Jew, a woman, a disabled person, or neuroatypical person is refused to speak, they are refused the act of telling their own story, advocating for their protection and dignity, claiming presence, and insisting to be protected by a society which marginalizes them.  What is lost when a homophobe, a transphobe, a racist, an Islamophobe or Anti-Semite, a misogynist, or an ableist is refused to speak? What about their core identity is being denied when they don't express their views that certain people are inferior, undeserving of dignity, or deserving of suffering? How comparable is that core identity - arguably, the identity of desiring to do harm to others - to the core identity of the marginalized people they silence by speaking?   If one insists that transphobes'/homophobes'/racists'/misogynists' core identity deserves to be valued, then they'd have to argue that these core identities - the desire to see other groups of people struggle and suffer without dignity - are equivalent to the identities of the groups of people themselves.  If one insists that they should be heard for no other reason than that someone is speaking, then all manner of speech should be considered valid - for one, ad hominem attacks are now fair game; for another, what is the merit of challenging dishonest speech? Is it defensible, for instance, for a college campus that claims to care about 'the marketplace of ideas' to let an evolution skeptic lead a bio class?  The inherent dignity of one group, as attached to their identity, is not equivalent to 'just, like, your opinion, man'. The insistence of persons like Rubin that those who do not value others' lives should deserve more of a chance to speak than the people whose lives they do not value says a lot about the end goals of that speech, and as a result why they are fundamentally inequivalent and should not be considered such in some attempt to make freedom of expression seem neutral to the spread of bad ideas."

"Disagree here and there, but had to finally jump on the Patreon. This channel is too good."
"Popular speech does not need the same protection as unpopular speech in my opinion. Also disagree with you that we need to 'take sides'. Less speech will only result in less understanding of what opinions people actually have out there and don't understand why that would be a good thing. Really don't want to live in a bubble even if that might be more comfortable. I get that it is tempting to only defend the speech you think is important or agree with, but then you are really not for free speech."

"6:26 - 6:33 - Although I see nothing legally wrong with this, I think people have reasonable grounds for concern over what actually constitutes racist, sexist, homophobic, and trans-phobic speech. It's not just conservatives who are silenced by these social pressures either, but liberals who are putting forward conscientious and well-considered views on controversial subjects. Certainly minority groups who face discrimination have a right to protect themselves from it, but how do we differentiate views which are in fact racist, sexist, homophobic or trans-phobic from views that are unpleasant and counter to whatever the current prevailing wisdom among progressives happens to be?       6:40 - Yes, and that can include people of all political persuasions who in fact have nuanced positions on controversial subjects but in practice refuse to support whoever happens to be the witch of the week. Have you looked at what's going on at Evergreen College? Professor Bret Weinstein does not strike me as even remotely conservative, and even in the videos that are being circulated you can see him trying to keep peace and promote understanding despite being confronted by what is essentially an angry mob -- not an an angry black mob, either, but an angry mob of predominantly white progressives who fancy themselves allies of racial justice.   6:55 - Do you not see a problem with this? People are using stigmatizing pejoratives to silence what is often conscientious and rational disagreement, and which is arguably best engaged with by other conscientious and rational individuals, often without any regard for whether or not those pejoratives are true. But then, even if the pejorative _isn't_ true, you can stretch the definition so that 'racist' is sufficiently broad to encompass anyone with implicit bias, or anyone who has ever (intentionally or otherwise) used any form of 'bad-faith' language in a dialogue wherein people are repeatedly insisting that we change the language as a good-faith gesture. It's a cheap rhetorical tactic known as an extension, and it's deceptively easy to employ because it caters to people who happens to have party biases.  7:26 - I would sooner consider whether or not the speech of the people who are being silenced via the application of stigmatizing pejoratives has a silencing effect on marginalized people, and if so, how much of a silencing effect are we talking about? Given the prevalence of this 'progressive' political ideology, there are several colleges wherein 'progressive' minority groups have far greater social power over their cisnormative, heteromasculine, white male peers, so long as the cishet white guy can be demonstrated to have failed a purity test.  Also, if this is indeed the issue, why is it that people feel silencing contentious views from the majority group is the best solution to this problem? Wouldn't you rather see minority groups encouraged to voice their arguments without shame or fear of reprisal and be met in turn with honest rebuttals? Then again, given the way your position on debate seems to have been developing, I suppose you wouldn't, because you'd likely see the audience as too credulous or too easily persuaded by bad ideas. If I'm not wrong about that, then I think you're missing something critical about the way we assess arguments, but that's beyond the scope of this reply.  7:43 - Almost everybody who doesn't have a YouTube channel feels that way. Hell, I feel that way, and I mostly just hate watch your channel because, despite disagreeing with almost everything you say, your opinions are usually well-considered, and you seem to make honest efforts not to misrepresent your opponents. But shit, this reply could easily be a video. Probably be a lot easier to get through also. I just don't want to risk the exposure.   8:14 - I think most of those conservatives and classical liberals are unsympathetic because the kind of heat you're talking about tends to burn everyone who creates content on YouTube, whereas the heat on college campuses is one-sided and earth-scorching. When Ranthony was talking about this, he read comments from angry dissenters, and the most memorable by far was the most savage instance of fat-shaming I've ever seen. And this is a kid who's made a video talking about how growing up fat has caused him to be riddled with insecurities. You know what he does? He laughs about it. It's a lot harder to laugh about being called 'racist, sexist, anti-gay,' by an angry mob, because that's the kind of thing that strikes a nerve with people.  There's also the question of how best to handle this, and it falls along party lines out of mutual distrust in ways that don't make it easy for us to mend fences. For instance, if Bearing made it his policy to go over to every channel to whom he responded and defend them against his fans, we'd doubtless see people trying to hold him morally accountable for every mean comment he didn't rebuff, or else this would be dismissed as some kind of pathetic token for his 'bigotry,' no matter how polite or well-formed his arguments happen to be. There are a lot of people in the 'Anti-SJW' community who are not allies and do not agree, and probably at least as much nuance within it as you'd find if you were to talk privately with other progressives.  My toothache is coming back, so I gotta cut this short and get some rest. Maybe I can cut this up into a video later? I just don't know if I want my first video ever to be a reply."

"I think the conversation surrounding the silencing effect of hate speech is very important, and I agree with your point regarding the 'free speech micro-aggressions', as you put it. Silencing people on ANY side with such buzzwords as 'Islamophobe' or 'racist' or 'crazy-leftist-SJW-special-snowflake-tumblrina', is just reductionist by nature, damaging, and unproductive on all fronts.   Where I begin to find issue with your argument, however, is where you say '[Dave + audience] only ever seem to stand up for the right of  people not to be silenced by slurs like racist and transphobe' (around 8:50). While I'm sure there are some fans of his who think that way, I find this statement to seriously misrepresent the position held by Dave and other prominent free-speech advocates. When university professors and administrators are actively forced to resign because of over-sensitive students and faculty, when dangerous legal precedents are being put into law with the 'potential' to govern what people MUST say*, and when individuals such as Aayan Hirsi Ali (who Dave recently interviewed) and others are forced to speak in undisclosed locations or with heavy security out of fear of ACTUAL violence from, in many cases, left-wing authoritarians, free speech becomes a legitimate concern beyond simple 'micro-aggressions' or hurt feelings. Attempting to silence people on the basis of PERCEIVED hate-speech is a slippery slope, one which many people on the far left have begun to fall victim to as of late. There is an ever-increasing view held by the far left that warrants opposing hate speech with violent protests and attacks on the careers and livelihoods of individuals. These are silencing methods that go FAR beyond simple cringe compilations and angry twitter mobs.  I understand your reasoning behind making this video, I just think that you are doing a bit of a disservice to people like Dave, who's intent is not to support bigots and racists but to promote an environment where communication, mutual respect and understanding flourish. People who regularly watch his videos and are fans of his know this to be true.  Perhaps I'm over thinking this. Perhaps the lady-boner I developed for Hitchens in middle school has permanently warped my perspective on this issue. I don't know. What I do know is that I appreciate your content; it makes me think. Hope this comment does the same.  *not just what they can't say; I highly recommend everyone watch Jordan Peterson's full hearing with the Canadian senate if you want to really understand why people really oppose the bill"

"Being called a racist on a college campus often leads to attempts to physically shut down the events wherein the person labeled racist is trying to speak.  Whereas facing the most brutal misogynist insults on youtube will not lead to your channel being terminated. We're being asked to choose between physically shutting down events based on charges of racism and the risk that allowing this speech might create a climate wherein others feel intimidated and will become voluntarily unwilling to risk speaking. Obviously physically shutting down a platform is more of an impediment to free speech and so, by a consistent logic, we should not allow charges of racism to justify no platforming speakers. The way micro-aggression creates a stifling climate can't rightly be compared to the way charges of racism are used on a college campus. However, the claim that the left has attempted to create a PC climate and further objections that the climate leads to self-censorship is analogous to the claims made by those who argue against micro-aggression.  However, it seems that the answer to both problem of micro-aggressions and the problem of political correctness stifling free expression would simply to be to champion free expression as a value in itself. That is, the aim should be to create a climate wherein the fear of being insulted is overcome by a commitment to free expression. Also, if you grant Peterson his claim that the human rights law he's complained about will force him to use particular pronouns (which is not clearly the case) you don't have any defense of the law on free speech grounds. Again, the apt comparison is not to contrast Peterson's refusal to use particular pronouns to the climate that using the wrong pronouns creates for transpeople, not if the concern is actually about speech. Rather the comparison to make would be between a similar injunction from Peterson, who is a Christian, on transpeople. If Peterson were to claim that using nonbinary pronouns suppressed the expression of his religious convictions and identity and were to attempt to mandate that all nonbinary people refer to each other based on his conception of sex differences then something comparable to what he's complaining about would be occurring.  When you return to Hitchens you seem to be accusing him of being against the speech, willing to suppress the speech, of 'fags, women, descendants of slaves' etc...but, in fact he is not. First, and again, there is a difference between attempting to create special protection of outlandish or marginalized speech and attempting to eliminate all speech that might lead to self-censorship. One is a sensible position the other is a crazy one. Obviously the 'classical liberal' who is concerned about Political Correctness is being the worst kind of hypocrite when he calls for the cancellation of, say, a gender studies program. He may feel that these gender studies programs are filled up with terrible ideas that, if taken seriously, would lead to the collapse of Western civilization, but if he cherishes free speech as a central plank or as the foundation of that Western culture he supposedly loves, he will have to argue against gender studies rather than attempt to suppress it for fear of the climate such speech creates. The same holds of those who claim to love free speech on the left. The claim that people are taking sides when they defend the rights of Fascists is utterly wrong, especially as your claim that one persons free speech always comes at the cost of another's free speech was founded on a false analogy.  Also, Hitchen's hypocrisy on this topic isn't a defense of your position. He probably ought not to have silenced that Truther, and he especially shouldn't have silenced him if he would have let Spencer rattle on at the same event."

"I'm glad you mentioned women who want to become content creators but are afraid to subject themselves to the misogyny and harassment. Way back in 2009, I was a teenage vlogger. One day, I realized my latest video was receiving an unusual amount of views. I was so happy; I thought all my hard work was finally starting to pay off. Then, I realized almost all the video's traffic was coming from a porn web site that fetishizes women with extremely impaired vision. (They could tell by the distortion in my glasses.) I received endless messages from foreign 'ophthalmologists' asking me to do various things on camera. It may not seem like a big deal, but they took my fun hobby and made me feel gross doing it. I tried popping in contacts, but then I started receiving messages about my naturally long nails. One group of men with a niche kink replaced another, and I realized it would never end. So I gave up.  I've always wanted to return to Youtube, but there are far worse predators than the glasses and nail guys these days. Thankfully, you make videos that express the thoughts and opinions I wish I could put out there. Not only are you not afraid of the shitlords, you call them the fuck out! I wish I had your courage. And your wardrobe. <3"

"Free speech isn't just about the freedom to offend people. Free speech is about allowing controversial ideas to be expressed, for better or for worse. We (as a society) shouldn't just ban ideas we don't like because sometimes we are wrong. Dealing with bad ideas is the price we pay so that when we inevitably make a mistake, a good idea will eventually come back around to challenge us."

"This isn't a bad video (I personally hated the intermissions and such, but well, makes it easier to digest for the audience I guess- - but I guess I'm not the target audience anyways :D), but it also does not really say or achieve much. I don't really want to go into the content too deeply, so I'll keep this abstract: This is a view of right wing arguments how free speech should be from a left wing position. You take their arguments and reject them, since your definitions of some ideas are different, meaning the arguments are flawed from your perspective. On that basis you reject their idea of free speech. To soften it up you bring an example in which Hitchens broke his own rules/laws (assuming the instance is well represented under the poc). The issue with this is, anyone with a left leaning position will agree with you, but anyone with a right leaning position will not. So if you actually want to achieve more than preaching to the choir, it does not do that.  I think a great example is the part in which you talk about the silencing effect of accusations of racism, homophobia, etc. These accusations, if uttered in public can have a devastating effect on a persons career and personal life - even if they are not true. The severity of what these accusations mean to the recipient is generally not known by the one saying them. Vice versa are the barbs in the words often used to target minorities (sexual, ethnic or whatever). The left tends to not see the first kind, the right tends to not see the second. While the vast majority of such words does not do much - they get said, nearly nobody hears it, it hurts for a bit and then people move on, from time to time they stick and can drive the recipient, regardless of if it's a homosexual, transgender person or a right winger into serious emotional peril.  Both sides care for different things and do not see their own flaws, which means they near permanently talk past each other - so the need for even more talk (If possible, dialectical) and attempts to find compromises and (in the case of the US) bipartisan legislation. Just be careful with not too much cracking down on Free Speech - both sides love to limit certain elements of Free Speech (For example - Left: Anti marginalized people / Hate Speech; Right: Anti American/Anti Authority), so once you start allowing topics to be off limits to 'protect' groups or ideas, you'll end up narrowing it more and more most likely."

"As for Dave Rubin, he seems to me to be a shallow thinker. He listens to his guests uncritically. It is kinda sickening to watch him have on people like Milo Yiannopoulos, Ben Shapiro, Mike Cernovich, Paul Joseph Watson, Carl ''Sargon of Akkad' Benjamin, and more as if that demonstrates his 'liberal' free speech bonafides. Dave Rubin left TYT because he could not stomach the intellectual dishonesty of Cenk Uygur yet hobnobs with Milo and friends, and never seems to challenge them at any point. Dave Rubin doesn't know what free speech is or how to foster it. He has become the TYT of the alt-right. He has rapidly become pathetic.   Christopher Hitchens is a bit different. He had a HUGE intellect and capacity to articulate that intellect. As is the case of many such people like that, he also had a HUGE ego to go along with it. And that ego got in his way at times of seeing things clearly. I enjoyed listening to him but was aware of his weakness.  On the whole I would judge his impact as a positive one with a few reservations for the times he followed his ego off the edge of the table.  Anyway, the back and forth between political ideologies (left vs right) has seen both sides ascendant and beleaguered. In my own lifetime, I remember the sixties when progressives were dominant and for the most part shouted down the conservatives. By the time Ronald Reagan became president, being a liberal was was downright evil. Nobody wanted to accept that label except for a small contingent. Most wanted to be 'centrist' and/or non-aligned. It has only been in the past decade that people again wanted to be called 'liberal', 'left', or 'progressive'. That's as far back as my cultural memories and experiences go, but I am sure it has done the same over and over in the past."

Freedom of speech is the right to voice any opinion you want; it is NOT the right to have that opinion be free from criticism."
"the trouble here is that you don't directly argue against their notion of free speech. You instead attack their selection of free speech to champion.

"So, what if I do think people should be allowed to call others racist, sexist, transphobic, whatever else? What if I believe that no speech should ever be silenced? I understand how one person saying something might scare another person into being silent, and that's a real tragedy, but I think that no idea should ever be limited, no exceptions. I mean, hell, I'm terrified to say anything on the internet in general because of the fact that I might revive some criticism or abuse but I whole heartedly think that there should never ever be any kind of restrictions on what words can be said. If the other person is wrong, correct them. I know many don't listen to reason, but the only way to understand another person is for them to express their ideas. In a perfect world, everyone would take turns, and I know that won't happen, but I think the best way to have the fullest understanding of others is to not disallow any idea, no matter how horrible."

"It isn't that calling someone a racist shuts down their free speech, it's that it shuts down a debate. Those are two very different things in my opinion.

I don't know how I get into those conversations... but anyway, all they really have to say is anecdotal conspiracy bullshit with zero evidence. Ask them for evidence and they just call me a filthy skank whore (which like, okay fine. At least buy me some dinner first and then show me some evidence). I almost feel like they should just be allowed to ramble because no one with half a brain would put any stock into what they're saying... but then I remember half of all people have an IQ of less than 100 and often don't have or use critical thinking skills. So then I think, should we withold a certain level of free speech from conspiracy theorists specifically in order to prevent the spread of nonsense onto unintelligent non-critical thinkers?

"God damnit. you have to go make well thought out reasoned arguments. I feel like I can defend the right of the Holocaust denier to speak and the right of a gender non binary person to say what they would like equally. where I find the difference is Holocaust deniers aren't trying to pass laws that make me give credence to what they are saying and validate what they are saying. on the other hand there is laws including once just passed in my country that are trying to legally force me to use the terms they decide for themselves thereby also giving credence to what they are saying whether I agree with their views on gender or not. that is my issue, the day Holocaust deniers get laws passed that force me to give some kind of credibility to their ideology by playing a long I will deem them as big a threat to my free speech as the other.

I don't agree with you on everything, but here I am, impatiently waiting your videos every day. That's not an easy taks to achieve, precisesly because we do not agree on many issues. However, thanks to you, I changed my thoughts on different matters. You are an individual I'd like to discuss every day, because we would have awesome debates and joyful laughs.  You are creative, humoruous, thoughtful and just enough creppy for my taste. You never come across as self righteous or judgemental, and that's part of your charm. Your content is high quality. Never stop making videos and thank you for your help!  P.S.: You have a thing for Socrates, do you? ;)"
"See Nick I don't know how you can say all this... Maybe you just don't mix with the kind of bullshit lefty(I am a lefty BTW) that Dave etc are talking about... You assume that everything that SJWs call hate speech IS actually hate speech.... The biggest one is criticism of religion, esp Islam.... And those critics do carry on speaking out(they can stand the heat) but they have the right to call out the BS... They don't take it in the same way as the SJWs who demand that no one criticises them.... Anyway they can easily make their own safe spaces online be.... PRIVATELY... No one is stopping them... Just don't try and turn places like YT (which are effectively public) into places where anyone can be banned because you will always upset someone.... You are the only one I always watch even though I disagree with you often because your videos are just great..."
"Safe spaces and trigger warnings are nowhere near shutting down free speech. Moreover, they're hardly ever used. I should know. I'm leftist, college student, elitist Californian scum."

"Another great video by possibly my favourite YouTuber"
"It is true that not everyone can speak at the same time in the same place and that thus the speech of one person potentially comes at the exclusion of the speech of another person, at least at a specific place in a specific time. Does this mean that 'liberal' free speech advocates are taking the side of, say holocaust deniers against, say transsexuals as you seem to imply in this video? I think that in most cases this is simply not the case. There are two reasons why that is my assessment. The first is that I believe that in practice most 'liberals' will prefer to listen to the average transsexual person or black person or female person etc speak rather than the average holocaust denier or creationist or (as I believe was demonstrated in this video) 9/11 truther. One should not confuse the antipathy that the 'liberal' feels towards trans-, black, or feminist activists (people who may or may not share the real concerns that most individuals in the relevant groups have) with their feelings towards queer, black or female persons in general.   The second reason is that free speech is not primarily about the rights of the speaker but rather the rights of the listener.  In proposing hate speech laws among other things one is not concerned with the person spouting hateful speech but rather the people listening to it; after all no one would seriously suggest that a person which shouts homophobic slurs alone in a empty forest should be arrested or otherwise punished, it only when there are others who can hear the things said when it becomes an issue. Thus the fact (if it is a fact) that that speech is a zero-sum game is irrelevant since what matters is who gets listened to, who gets invited to be listened to, who one is allowed to be listened to. The fact that it is the speaker who tends to be protested, disinvited or prosecuted is merely the result of the fact that this is easier and more intuitive to do than to attack the listeners. Thus if (for example) Milo whateverpolis is invited to speak at a venue this means that some people want to listen to him and if he because of protests is disinvited or otherwise prevented to speak at said venue, then it is not primarily the rights of Milo which has been violated but rather the rights of the people who wanted to listen to him. It might be true that marginalized people deserve more protections than the holocaust denier (although the notion that such a person is not marginalized seems absurd to me) but the former group are not entitled to an audience nor should the latter be denied one if people want to listen. Freedom of speech is about whether you or I are allowed to listen to whoever and whatever we want or if some things should never reach our ears.   Having said all that, I wouldn't call myself a free speech advocate since while I would indeed have no issue with having a holocaust denier speak even on national television, I would probably be in favor of restricting ISIS propaganda and otherwise restrict speech which is used to organize certain disruptive activities. I don't believe in a free marketplace of ideas but I do believe that debate and open dialectic is ultimately a good thing. I suppose that one could say that I'm somewhere in between the two sides in the free speech issue."
"7:38  you know it doesn't have to do with them being trans or women but them saying bigoted and down right awful things. (the examples you are showing).  and i have known feminists that just deal with the 'well you are wrong and are stupid for it'. your little group gets hate bc you guys are CONSTANTLY either saying stupid shit or start fights with antis. it doesn't magically happen.  so please don't leave the part out of the sjw YouTube's part in why it sucks to be a sjw youtber now.   it is a combat of ideas. men do deal with this as well and some leave youtube too. the internet isn't a place for the faint of heart or can't take mental abuse well."
"Here's a few possible counter definitions of common buzzwords/ phrases:  'Virtue signaling':  Shut up about the shit I do that is wrong.  'PC Culture Gone Mad': Don't you miss the days when them minorities and such just had to sit there and smile when you called them names? Don't you just wish they would shut up already?  'Racism doesn't mean anything anymore': Boy, I wish I could make people believe that racism only means what I want it to mean: something that can't apply to me and I have no need to ever think about. But that seems unlikely, so I'll settle for shaming and gaslighting so at least they'll shut up."

"I always want to ask these Freeze Peach defenders what they think about libel and slander laws?  Should I be able to sue a newspaper if they publish provable lies about me?  If so, I think we can from there argue that slurs are a kind of generalized cultural libel.  When I call a Black person the n-word, what I am in fact doing to promoting slander against them."
"If there's one thing this video should make clear for everyone, it's that terms like 'racist', 'sexist' and 'homophobic' are poor replacements for an actual argument."
"7:23  nope. nice try to weasel in this very pseudo scientific thought process. we as humans don't have 'micro aggressions' as part of our emotional makeup. meaning we aren't so weak that the ASSUMPTION of racism hurts us.  Micro aggression is nothing more than 'i can't prove that you are blantly racist, but since i am offended for whatever reason, i am going to say it is bigoted'.  this is against free speech in the sense is that it will derail conversations or put accusations that harm someone's career.  this is so ironic bc you just got done with saying 'well they are words to make you stop what you are talking about'. this isn't even a contradiction but a very clear example that you don't understand that this make the left very hard to deal with if people follow these rules.  so no, these aren't laws but they are definitely social rules in left circles that make people not want to deal with y'all. but of course it will just be summed up as 'well so you just want to be free to be rude'."
"I think the term 'Islamophobia' should be replaced with 'anti-Muslim bigotry.'  One can criticize the doctrine of Islam without holding any hatred against Muslims. The problem with the word Islamophobia is that it makes no clear distinction between the criticisms of Islam made by ex-Muslims, secularist Muslims, liberal Muslims, and feminist Muslims with the criticisms made by legit hate/fear-mongers.   Pointing out the Koran is sexist is not inherently bigoted against Muslims but could be called Islamophobia.  Saying that Muslims are a bunch of savage rapists is bigoted but would also just be called Islamophobia.  'Anti-Muslim bigotry' allows one to call out actual bigots without silencing well-minded liberals from Muslim majority countries."
"What's particularly funny about Hitchen's not caring for the freedom of speech for women is that Mill, who he gave as an example of someone who helped form the ideas he was expressing, was himself an important feminist."

"I'm against free speech protection. The government have no right on what we want to say, to protect or allow. Every body is free to think what we want, but once you say it, you have to deal with the responsibilities of it.  BTW, freedom of speech is only sacred in the US constitution, every where in the world, there is no such thing. Because freedom of speech by a government is fucking stupid."
"4:06 - did you just decide to add in the word 'marginal' for your own purposes. Hitchens didn't suggest that it was due to the marginal nature of the view that it is deserving of protection. It's all points of view whether marginalized or not. He is talking about protecting free speech for every person who wishes to speak freely.  He also makes no mention of 'amplifying' these viewpoints. The important thing is that these views are taken upon their merit alone and not external amplification.  8:09 - because the consequences in some places of being branded a racist could land you in legal trouble  10:39 - like I said earlier, the holocaust denier does not get special protection. Both groups get the protection as they are both free to speak their minds and say their piece.  11:30 - thankfully there are other video hosting websites that don't have these restrictions. Interestingly enough most are modeled after YouTube itself and specifically designed to fill that gap. Tell you what, it may be time to start looking for that giant woman and lizard mask because all you need is the address for YouPorn and you can make all the full penatrative videos you want.   (simply put Dave doesn't need to complain about that restriction on YouTube because it isn't a blanket restriction acrossthe people who want to post that kind of content. They have options available to do what they want to do... and get this in a link back to Hitchens... the audience has the right to choose whether they want to watch it or stick with YouTube)"

"Amazing video as always. When I discovered your videos last week it made me I wish I wasn't a broke ass songwriter so I could regularly contribute in your patreon."
"Quite thought provoking!"
"I love everything about this video, everything!  I think the arguments in it also remind me of Peter Coffin's video about Free Speech, he drew similar conclusions, I believe, but both video are great  The one thing I think I would add is the inherent imbalance between the concerns of the two sides, though this may be what Contra will be talking about in later videos on the topic. Those who are 'pro-free speech' are afraid that they will not be allowed to say bigoted thing, if they so choose to, while those who are 'anti-free speech' (often consisting of minority groups and their allies) are afraid that people who say bigoted things will hurt or kill them or other people because they view hate speech and verbal attacks, while not necessarily as a guarantee, as an indicator of acceptance of bigotry and prejudice which can lead to physical attacks on occasion. In the end, it's freedom vs. safety, though it's not as fair as that since those who are 'pro-free speech' often do not need to fear for their safety and instead fear for their freedom, while those on the 'anti-free speech' side are much more concerned about safety than freedom since safety is often something that they are not afforded."

"Well said. My basic defense of David Rubin is that he has said (and I do believe) that he would love to have 'social justice warriors' on his program to say their piece. Whoever is in the room is accorded respect and a chance to speak. His invitations are to a wider crowd than accepts them. I would very much like to hear his encounters with marginalized peoples of all varieties: he's a good interviewer."

"1:40 I'm starting to hear the voice of a British guy talk about pro wrestling."
"First of all, Wonderful video. I especially liked the part where you pointed out how easily hate speech can shut people up and how people resort to 'freedom of speech' as a defense mechanism against criticism.  There is, however, a point I would like to address. Although, mostly related to your previous video, I think there is value in interviewing a Nazi and nodding with them in agreement  all the way because that way you can see his bullshit in pure form. Even if Richard Spencer is a deceptive prick(I don't doubt he is) you can see what that deception looks like and as a result next time when you run into someone else spreading such an ideology  it will be a lot easier for you to point out whats wrong with it. In your previous video  you had the Jewish character, in the end, wondering what he could of said to change their minds and although there is probably little you can do to change a Nazi's mind but you could expose his bullshit for what it is so the audience doesn't fall for it.   Anyhow, I am really grateful for your videos which are not only entertaining but are also very educational. In my opinion, this is  probably the best channel on Youtube right now."

By focusing on the defense of bigots and provocateurs, they ignore the effects of the hateful speech they defend.

Nothing is stopping anyone from using pronouns like 'Master' and 'Master's.'"

He used to shill for left wing in his TYT days, now he shills for the right wing. 'You have to chose a side, you have to decide which speech you will protect' - no. Fuck off. There are not enough sane people left as it is."
"Rubin isn't jumping over fences to offer commies to come on his show. Much like Hitchens, he's just a right-winger who claims the left has... left him, while in fact they just didn't want to acknowledge their own political views. Hitch was a Trotskyist, and like all Trots he turned out to just like the sound of left-politics, without the actual range of beliefs that make one a left-winger."

No one is obligated to listen to your bullshit. No one is obligated to host it.

"Thank you for verbalizing how I've felt about Rubin's show for awhile! Initially, I enjoyed his content because it felt like someone getting down to the bottom of all of the poisonous commentary that lead up to the election. I've been really soured by his content over the past year or so as, to your point, it's lack of defense of liberal values has made the whole show feel more like pointed posturing. #imsorrybabies"

"Why everyone loves Hitchen so much ? ' . I never loved him . I always though he was  unbereable , an apologist for american imperialism (after 9/11 ) , a disgrace for atheism (like all ' new atheists ' , and I say this as an asshamed atheist ) . And all of that is worse , because unlike many of the people who fall in those categories , he was articulate and rethorically appealing ."
"A link to the Christopher Higgings speach? (That man gives me the creepes...) Ha, you make philosophy much more interesting!"
"I think ContraPoints kinda... miss the point here. What people complain about 'the left being agaisnt free speech' is not due to trolls and annoying people online that make others feel unconfortable with talking, it's about the straight up violent protests that try to shut down people from... well... speaking. Correct me if I'm wrong but I never saw the equivalent of that regarding the right. I never saw for example a right wing movement trying to violent prevent a left wing person to give an speech in a university or to talk to reporters."
"My thoughts: Big balls you've got there going after Hitchens. He is certainly the steelman of the position. Rubin is so flaccid on everything after saying just after the election 'I'll be the first to hold Trump's feet to the fire' (lol) and I'm glad this video isn't about him. Hitchens is the best on this issue, so you've certainly got my attention. Not sure you're steelmanning Hitchens, though.  He is someone who has fought for all the people that social justice folks fight for, and has reported on the mistreatment and abuse of just about every group of people. He brings up the holocaust denier example just as a pertinent example that many would disagree with, and he does it for that very reason. You know that, and you know he stands up for these other groups, so why leave that out?   You've also made what I believe was a bit of a 'slickman', if not an outright strawman, when you attempt to catch Hitchens. You suggest he contradicts himself in two places in this video. The first is when he says we should be providing platform to the Holocaust denier but then he discounts the social pressure that would chill the speech of blacks, gays, etc. It seems to me that you yourself provided the response to your own criticism here. Hitchens is arguing for protection for the holocaust denier on one of the higher two levels of legal protection for the speech/speech on campus. He is certainly not arguing that we can't call him names or socially pressure him. Hitchens has himself written and spoken scathingly on the 'social pressure' level against Holocaust deniers and other conspiracy theorists. In short, I don't think Hitchens actually believes that holocaust deniers or gays or blacks or anyone else needs or deserves this protection at the lowest 'social' level. Hence why you need to cart in 'lesser thinkers' like Rubin and Peterson here for their 'don't call me a racist' form of speech protection, which you get quite right in my view.  The second time you try to catch Hitchens you bring up the fact that he would tolerate any interruption, then at a different talk doesn't tolerate an interruption. Okay. I don't think in any case he needed to tolerate an interruption when he was the official speaker, but he took a risk and felt in a particularly frisky mood in the first clip. The second clip he was also taking questions and was a member of a panel, correct? He can dismiss a bad question during question time without contradicting his claim that he would tolerate an interruption during a speech. It seems like a bit of a stretch to try to say you really did any damage to his position.  Summary: You've made your job much harder by going for the full steelman on Hitchens rather than the easier (and more relevant) pickings on some of these centrists that seem to be pandering to the right such as Rubin, Saad, Peterson, etc. In going for the full steelman, however, I don't think you've managed to actually knock it down. The knocks on Hitchens seem answerable, and in multiple places you've needed to re-insert the Rubins of the world as the target when Hitchens held up to your attack or didn't really offer up the same vulnerability.  Anyway, I think you're the best liberal voice on youtube and I appreciate your style as a philosophy PhD student myself. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series. Would be tickled if I got a response to this post. XD"

"You are amazing!  I agree with the point that you made against free speech being appropriated to de-platform trans people, women and minorities in general.  The mockery and derision they open themselves to by using their 'free speech' just goes to show how feeble the whole notion of free speech is and how its most ardent defenders themselves are inconsistent in its practice.  However, the need to legitimize contrarian viewpoints is very much plausible.  It's through debate and counter arguments that the 'stronger' side will surface, and that's something an educated society should open themselves to, minus the stupid ad hominem slurs and name-calling.  In fact even in that case, the most sensible opinion will prevail, in a society of civilized and educated people.  But that's a utopia, Dave Rubin, Milo Yiannopolous and their ilk seem to relish from an audience that sees name-calling and abusive behavior as philosophical theses."

"Interesting on a number of levels. This is definitely something I have been debating a lot recently in my head since watching RM's interview with Richard Spencer. I've been trying to put my thoughts into a video of what is and isn't Richard Spencer but truthfully, without Roaming's 'talk' I would never have been able to see how batshit insane he was. All I had to go on was him getting punched in the face (because hilarious memes spread like wildfire, and a clip of him screaming heil Trump). Sure, he seemed like a shitbag, but why was this shit bag suddenly so popular? I have researched that, in fact, his crazyass idea's gain in popularity might have a lot of factors but economic disparity seems to be a popular one when the trend of radicalization comes up. So... let's first think, were Nazi's popular because they were given  a platform? Possibly. There is certainly some evidence of this with their crazy amount of propaganda and the like and the new invention of speakers being utilized.  I am not saying this is not implying by any means that this was the ONLY reason but I know it was a factor.  That being said. We once talked about what we do and how you used to write fiction. I currently attempt to write screenplays and am at a constant war in my head over telling the story I want to tell and feeling like I am gonna piss the wrong people off.  My films (raunchy, and silly) are never really looked upon favorably at woman's film festivals and the like. Maybe I'm just shit, but a few people in the industry did point to me that my style was not what those particular festivals were looking for. And it made me mad. Of course it did. I'm a woman. I identify as female. I;m a goddamn minority to boot. But my story has too much profanity and violence and in this whole idea of inclusion, I felt particularly excluded because I was not the type of woman they were looking for.   Now, I will not equate that to censorship but feelings were hurt.  Now, you had once spoken about Cultural Appropriation and so have I and this is a bit of the topic that always sends me teetering to one edge, because artists HAVE been silenced or have had their exhibitions pulled or yoga classes cancelled or protested, and look, everyone is in their right to do that but it certainly is discouraging. It certainly pisses me off that I feel more constrained than ever. Why can't I wear my fucking kimono out in public for fear that some angry dickhead is gonna scream at me for being offensive? I lived in Japan for 3 years, took a literal class on how to wear in popular, and a Japanese person sold it to me! I want to fucking wear it because it means something to me as a human being and I get annoyed. Annoyed is not the same as silenced.  And you know what? Maybe that's good that I at least notice I'm gonna piss people off before going 'fuck it' this is my way of expressing myself and they can suck a dick of righteous indignation.  Wow, that was  a rant. No idea if it made a lick of sense. Take care Nick."

"Firstly I watched that hitchens speech and you really seem to have taken the comments of his out of context. When he said People were free to direct Insults at him he added 'at your own risk', which certainly puts that in a different and playful light.  Overall i would say that this is far more nuanced than you give it credit for. There is a ton of People on the left that are just absolute cancer on the issues of free speech, especially on Campus. I would certainly agree with you however that Rubin is a moron and is blinded by his hatred for the left (which is in part fuelled by sjw morons, but mostly really is just him being an idiot Coward, who Needs to cater to his cancerous right wing audience). Obviously there is also massive attacks (even on a political Level) on free speech from the right and finally i do agree that racist √°nd other hatespeech can silence People, but I would suspect that Hitchens would have agreed here as well. However People who argue that one has to be careful to brand certain speech hateful have a Point. It is weird. Clearly racist People are not getting called out for it while especially many academics are cast out despite not having a racist bone in their Body. Finally I want to add that of Course noone deserves a platform a priori. However there is enough examples of People that should just as much be deprived of a platform, such as linda sarsour ect, if this is indeed how we want to go about this"

"i would agree with you when it comes to the lgbt community and minority races. But not Islam. Islam is an idea you can critique the fundamentals of Islam without being bigoted against Muslims. Just as you can critique Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism‚Äã any religion without being a bigot towards Christians, Jews, and Hindus. A better word to use instead of Islamaphobia would be Muslimphobia."
"Being silenced by frivolous and often false accusations of racism, sexism etc in the real world is worse than being intimidated by anonymous trolls online. The former can have actual consequences."
"Hitchens calls 911 truth ers fascist and shut them down... but play nice with holocaust deniers.  Which often the holocaust deniers are actual fascist.  Hitchens is an idiot on that."
"9:13 That's a pretty intense misreading of Jordan Peterson's position on transgendered people. I do, however, share in the disdain for the types of programs he chooses to go on and what he chooses to say when he's on them. I've actually attempted to question his choice of cherry-picking alt-right and conservative platforms to no avail."
"But we want to see the penetration"
"Honestly, this is something that's annoyed me about Dave for a long time. Thanks for making this video."
"If this is a video where I have to look at Rubin, then forget it, I'd rather look at you and the Golden one in your shorts again."
"Intelligent, funny and well edited, awesome video Contra"
"Good video. However... you need to work on your Mandarin bro. It's a bit stilted. üòú"
"Nobody is entitled to a platform but when you have hordes of moronic university students trying to shut down, harass or ban speakers who have been invited already then it is an issue. and as far as college campuses go, it is predominantly the identity politics crowd and student unions that are bullying everyone.Ôªø"
"who is 'the left' tho?  what, the democrats? lol.   half the planet seems to have forgotten what it actually means to be 'left wing'."
"To me, free speech fits in with a larger theory of democracy. Contrary to what I perceive to be a dominant belief, there are certain opinions which are prohibited (rightly so) in a democracy, thereby limiting free speech. These include for instance opinions that exclude others from the process of democracy (racism, for example)."
"you are the hero SJWs need"
"side note: i love your style."
"Just so you know, I am a Rubin fan.  I also very much enjoy your content, though I don't always agree.  To be clear though, you 100% make the best SJW style content I have ever seen, and I follow all the common names on youtube.  You are the only one that I feel like makes content that is intellectually challenging and clearly presented.  Maybe I need to find smarter SJW style channels (If anyone has any recommendations let me know).  I think that you and my (and Rubin's) positions are, from a theoretical perspective, not actually very far apart.  I do think some of your points here are weak and strawmanning, more than actually pointing out inconsistencies.  Sometimes it feels as though you are responding to troll comments online more than Rubin himself, and they are not the same thing.  The Hitchens 9/11 truther example is not a strong point for you.  Maybe I misunderstand the circumstance, but it seems like it is a person trying to interrupt a conversation that is about a different topic - this was Hitchen's forum, and not the random person's forum.  Hitchens, Rubin, and any other rational human being would have no problem with the that truther creating an event and speaking - and they would likely have a significant issue with people shouting him down such that his audience cannot listen to him.  I look forward to your video regarding deplatforming, because I suspect that is a more interesting topic.  People are generally not purist, and it is a mistake to pretend that they are.  Of course they will be OK with some hate speech laws and not others.   Sometimes we make mistakes and don't account for certain things, that is expected.  Additionally, you made a logical mistake in comparing hate speech regulations in the workplace with a hostile work environment created by the use of microaggressions.  Actually you wrongly compared calling people racist/etc to get them to shut up to microaggressions, when they aren't really so micro - they are just intentional aggression (and microaggressions are commonly unintentional).  Whatever though.  For the most part, I think that the classical liberal position isn't necessarily inherently against speech laws that remove people who have been shown to be acting in bad faith, but rather are against people being attacked or legislating such that it affects them when they are *not* operating in bad faith.  Overall, regarding the conversation around free speech - Hate Speech is a mildly interesting topic, but I don't think there is that big of a controversy there.  Certainly not a meaningful one.  The trigger warnings conversation is dumb.  Safe Spaces are pretty simple too, but there may be real disagreement there (don't strawman the arguments against safe spaces, as typically they don't have a problem with places like your home being safe, so much as they are against entire campuses being 'safe').  Deplatforming will be the more meaty topic, I think, as it follows real things that are happening and real intellectual disagreement, more than just dumb internet trolls that get amplified.  Thanks for the video."
"every one of your videos is a psycho-sexual odyssey"
"Most interesting."
"I really like this video since it made me think a lot thanks"
"This is actually a REALLY good video and argument."
"I just hope you realize your side is just as hypocritical about this. Didn't care about censorship of conservatives but suddenly cared when LGBT channels were being silenced by Youtube."
"'Fascism is when you punch people for being racist, and the more people you punch, the more fascister it is'-Benito Mussolini, probably"
"NO TOLERANCE FOR THE INTOLERANT ! BASH THE FASH !"
"People calling you a racist or a nazi is not censorship. That's someone else using their speech to counter yours.  (The same goes for youtubers who get shit on in the comment section)  People de-platforming, attacking, and rioting against public figures is censorship.   THAT'S what most people are talking about when they say the left is against free speech."
"This was very interesting. I like your take on the issue."
"MUH FREEZE PEACH!"
"Sparkling water and Scotch? I will now judge you!"
"I bet Sargon wouldn't de-platform that 9/11 truther."
"I'm loving the different languages you've been including in your videos lately. I also love how you've started taking 'SJW' topics and explaining them in a way that, possibly, anti's will understand."
"Hitchens gets away with a lot because he speaks it with a british accents. It's fucking unfair as fuck because he spent an awful lot of time working on how to make terrible shit sound real fucking logical. And then he died young-ish and gained martyr status. Wonderful."
"As I understand it...the main difficulty Rubin and his ilk have with the Left and 'free speech' has little to do with simply labeling someone a misogynist or what have you, and more to do with violently preventing speakers from touring college campuses etc.  Simply calling someone a bigot is a form of battling their use of speech with your own use of speech, which I suppose would be just hunky dory.  Perhaps that topic will come up in the 'Deplatforming' video to follow."
"Who is driving and where are they going?"
"Did someone slip something into my coke zero? Your videos are very trippy"
"so good!!!"
"You rock, Contra! P.S. Love the Satanic pentagram. ;)"
"Goddamn it, I love your videos so much it actually motivates me to do freelance translation work so I can become a patron and pay for your booze."
"Ayy, you have the same copy of the second sex as me!"
"bill maher compared milo yiannopolis to Christopher Hitchens?   Someone go stop Hitchens from flipping in his grave before he drills out and destroys us all."
"12:14 unexpected shot at Truther of Akkad"
"Oh dis gun b gud"
"Easy answer: Yes!"
"I never fully agreed with hitchens but he was surely a fantastic speaker himself, he was very eloquent etc. but damn is his an idiot on free speech."
"You actually made a good case for individualism and free speech at the same time. And while i see no problem with calling out genuine racists, homophobes, misogynists etc... I see a great problem with falsely accusing people of being those things and then placing the burden of proof on them to prove they are not."
"I love you contra"
"contra i live for your videos x"
"freedom is a spook"
"More abstractism between  them two , so many references , from lynch's twin peaks to Dali's Un Chien Andalou , and many more in between , its perfect , turn it into a movie  'THERE IS NO PHONE'"
"Does it mean Sargon would have been a fascist crackpot in Hitchens eyes for being a 9/11 truther?"
"This is the best fucking channel on YouTube. I love the increasingly absurdist/artsy/pretentious/weirdo direction it keeps evolving into. The black and white Chinese segments gave me a boner."
"i love it when liberals think they re cornetstones of the left. it's cute."
"You could make a song out of 'the left __________ free speech' lol  And by the way, I love the bossa nova song at 1:40 lol"
"The American right thought 'if we could get all the gun owners under our thumb by scaring them into thinking the second amendment would be taken away, imagine how many would come running to us if they felt that the first amendment was in danger.'"
"Okay, could someone more musically-inclined than me decode the notes in the final segment (starting at 16:20)? I'm pretty sure thay hide some sort of message and I'm curious."
"All of your videos are so well spoken wow"
"You're my new favorite person."
"As always Contrapoints, your videos are awesome"
"Your book placement in this video is immaculate"
"Inb4 Dave Rubin announces 'I should be against the deplatforming of 9/11 truthers? Great idea, Contrapoints! I'll have Sargon of Akkad on for another 45 uninterrupted minutes of me sucking his dick'"
"¬ø?"
"So... when are Rubin going to give his plataform to ISIS' speakers? They must be protected according to him."
"i never really understood the big hard on people have for hitchens. He's intelligent and his views are interesting, but the man was kind of just a douchebag. it's fine to idolise intelligence but i don't think putting an asshole up on a pedestal is a good idea. people will begin to think they aren't mutually exclusive."
"i sent this video to my bf so fast that i said 'NEW CONTRAPUNT' typoed and then your first point was about being against punching people so basically i predicted it kind of"
"also you are pretty hawt.Stop it"
"debate milo, contra"
"hitchens is bae. Dont put him in a thumbnail with Dave 'the last fencerider' rubin"
"Well, Hbomb's vid got taken down, so Nick is here to save the day!"
"I had no idea Hitchens was such a fucking asshole. Never bothered to look either."
"WOOOOOOO!"
"*H U G E W I N I N T H E W A R O F I D E A S !*"
"you're getting prettier and prettier by the way"
"Wooo, another straw man episode!"
"Does the right hate criticism?"
"420th viewer! smok wee errdayy"
"Dave Rubin looks like JFK if JFK was a total shit eater."
"I watch this channel religiously."
"ContraPoints has uploaded.  Thank god.  I need this now... more than ever..."
"OOOH BOI THIS GON BE GUD"
"Top bop, won't stop"
"Not really liking this new hairstyle/makeup. You look like Johnny Depp in Charlie And The Chocolate Factory."
"BUT MUH RIGHTWING FREEZE PEACH"
"Only if you mean Free Speech‚Ñ¢ and all of its american exceptionalist identity cult crap. The freedom to say things I think the left actually likes.   But yeah, I'm just answering the question in your title and _then_ watching the video like every person on the internet does now in order to have a comment of minor substance that shows up early.  EDIT: So yeah, this is a great video."
"No more Contrapoints. I don't want you making question me question my sexuality anymore."
"I missed you"
"hitchens is hot tbh"
"Tell me, comment folk, what is the meaning of freedom?"
"it seems like I was the first viewer, if that even matters"
"As a Big Left, I hate freeze peach. I hate peaches. But I like the freeze."
"FIRST MOMMY I LOVE YOU NICKY YOU'RE SO FINE U BLOW MY MIND"
"Notification squad bb!"
"Never clicked so fast in my life"
"First! Notification squad?"
