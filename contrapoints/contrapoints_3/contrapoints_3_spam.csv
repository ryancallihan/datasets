612,"People in general need to just calm the fuck down across the board. From proud shitlord to SJWs and all across the spectrum. I tend to fall in the Dave Rubin camp, where we want to avoid truly offending anyone, but realize there are bad ideas. Not every trans individual is going to pass perfectly, but if someone accidentally screws up pronouns. My dad is short with man boobs and luxurious wavy hair when it gets long, if someone calls him ma'am, it's not a big deal. If I came up to Milo Stewart in the street my initial reaction would probably be to call him her. If corrected I would change. Same with Genderterroist. Sorry but when I see broad shouldered hairy dude I'm going to use masculine pronouns. If they say call me Sarah duchess of York, I'm gonna be like, cool Fergie how you doin. I understand why the shitlord backlash exists. I used to be a social justice advocate until I realized being a decent person isn't good enough for that crowd. I Used to be a feminist, but then I got to know the crowd and realized I refuse to fight for someone's frothing idealogy. I am a human rights advocate. Period. If someone is legitimately being oppressed I will have their back, but I can no longer stand by and support the victim narrative, nor the cultural relativism arguments. Good ideas should be supported and bad discouraged.  I know I kinda went screedy but you seem fairly rational in your video, and we need more reasonable voices in the true egalitarian world.",en,relativeinsight,2019-08-01T00:00:00,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
