But what do I know I'm a white straight women who has never clashed with another persons personality (sarcasm). I may not agree with someone's religion of politics, religious beliefs, life changing decisions, etc, but I make it a point to treat people the way I would want to be treated. That is until I can't take their mistreatment and hypocrisy anymore. That's when I realize their personality flaws clash with my personality flaws and it's time for both to go opposite ways. I can't imagine why anyone's personality would clash with persephone's personality based on the comments she leaves (sarcasm).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think SJW/feminist/trans/etc just miss the point: everyone hate everyone else, the reason is irrelevant. People hate their neighbors, people from a part of the town hate people from another part of the town, people of a town hate people of the city near to theirs, near from a region hate people of other region, people from a country hate people of other country, than sex, color of skin, tradition, political view, food preference (pineapple pizza), and so on. Where there is a group there are people outside the group, and they are wrong (lol). I truly bevilieve that fight for one kind of people (gay, trans, etc) makes that group an outsider and than makes 'grow' a resentment about them. To be racist against withe is not good, talking about 'black lives matters' only put the 'me vs you' kind of feeling that is the core problem about racism. Making a group is become an opposition to others, and that's the opposite of overcome racial prejudice. My mother is a 'bad femminist' and she say all the time things likes 'women are better than men', and my very young nephew after a while started to respond to her with 'women are whiny', even if everybody else always teached to him that 'male and female are equal'. If you separate your 'kind' from the 'normal people' you will be an enemy. I know it's hard to be perceived as 'normal' (none is normal, none is actually perceived o think about himself 'i'm normal') and i have no idea how to overcome this. It's so hard to let think 'white males' that they are on the same boat of other groups that proclaims all the time 'we are not like you people, fuck you' (that's the perception i have about feminism and sjw as a white male on the web, maybe because bad messages are 'louder', i don't know). If you want an 'inclusive society' stop exluding yourself, stop the difference 'we against them' and just.. be what you are.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I think this might be an issue that we should discuss and try to prevent because it's like a paradox of not feeling good enough and then going through with surgery that might make you pass less, make your life harder.  I think the politics surrounding trans people and the massive rejection of them right now might be a big factor in this mentality of never feeling good enough. It's something I hope we can mend over time.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think if she wasn't cis passing and as conventionally attractive as she was and made a utube, it'd be a completely different Blaire white. Not to say she didn't work hard to look as good as she does and to have as smooth of a transition and this definitely shouldn't be downplayed (ykno in spite of what it says about the fact that trans ppl have to bend over backwards to confirm to conventional and useless gender roles but whatever), but because of this she seems incapable of empathy regarding the trans community. It's kinda like a vicious cycle tho. She has a bad experience with the trans community because of some of her more concerning actions online and makes a video on it. The trans community hates her even more and this gives her more conviction to her disscontempt with other trans ppl and it goes on. Like you said her first few vids were genuine and quite good but she was unfortunately edged into the anti sjw mould as most ppl on this website are.

"Yes, part of what's cool about her is the fact she's not easily offended in a day where ppl are offended by anything, and everything b/c it shows maturity and class. That doesn't mean that ppl that complain about real injustice aren't cool but, rather the extremist that limit their personality to victimhood, and see everything w/ let's-look-for-something-to-be-offended-by glasses aren't cool. Some of the complaints are valid, like about lack of rights for the gays & lesbians to get married, trans to go in the bathrooms they choose, ect.  but then u have crazy ppl like Riley J Dennis who thinks lesbians are transphobes for not liking p3n!s, claiming it to be a female part which ironically not only erases lesbians by demanding we suck and fk d!ck like many cis het males would, but erases trans ppl as well by telling them their is no biological differences in the sexes so there is no need for transition and lesbians and hetero males should just accept their c0ck in their @$$ even though it's unwanted. Both the extreme right, and the extreme left are hypocritical fake af whiny bigoted hateful nuts in my opinion, just in diff ways. So yeah, I like the fact she's so laid back, and while I don't agree w/ everything she says 100% of the time (like the idea of female privilege for example, it's naive and I would gladly reverse these 'privileges' for equal respect of ideas, not being sexually harassed and being less likely to be raped, abused, ect or that the bathroom situation isn't a problem for trans that really try to pass, ect.), but I respect that she's not afraid to say it, that she can think for herself, she's at open to new ideas, she's not easily offended and that she's not a fake. Like u say, all that is refreshing these days. While she says tranny, it's in the context of how black ppl will say 'wazz up my nigga'. It's done in love, and not in hate, kinda like re-claiming the word, and taking away it's power. Idk if anyone should or can be a spokesperson for any group. Ppl are individuals w/ diff ideas on how to fix the world, regardless of what label they fall under, and every human on this planet is highly flawed. I don't think anyone is a perfect example of how to be. That being said I love both u, and Blaire. I think ur both great people. Both outspokenness, free-thought, and being laid back are things that help to make anyone cool, and regardless of not agreeing w/ some of what she says, I think it's ridiculous to demonize someone for not thinking exactly the same b/c nobody agrees on everything, and ppl are all human and make mistakes. To expect perfection will eventually alienate everyone for we all fall short of the glory.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"She's gross. I could go on YouTube and talk about how I personally don't face racism, as people tend to identify me as 'exotic' rather than a Native American, so therefore, all Native people are overreacting to the way society treats us. I'm not a victim.  But that would not only be disrespectful, dishonest, misleading, and untrue for virtually every other Native, it would denigrate a very real and very serious problem in our society. Native people face insane discrimination, and make up ten times the population average of those missing, murdered, and incarcerated.  That's what she's doing. She's saying that SHE doesn't get the shit kicked out of her for daring to dance with a man without announcing the status of her genitals. SHE wasn't disowned by her family and forced into prostitution to survive. SHE has never been publicly humiliated when she just wanted to go pee. So therefore those problems don't exist? No. Fuck her. She is silencing the voices of thousands of people who don't WANT to be victims, but are victimized on a regular basis. Against their will. That's what victimization is.  She has moments where she acknowledges her privilege, but she just resumes deriding the experiences of most trans people immediately afterwards, so she either doesn't realize or doesn't care what she's doing to her own community. Community being other people living the same experience of being trans.  Most people tend to guess half a dozen races before I just tell them. I've had people say, 'Oh. You're just too pretty to be Native!' like I'm supposed to take that as a compliment. But that's how society sees my people. It is ugly, disgusting and totally unfair.   I won't let anyone exempt me from the experiences of the hundreds of Native women who are missing that cops won't even look for. From my grandmother's generation that were abducted from their families and forced into residential schools where unspeakable things were done to them. From the Native people who have garbage thrown at them, who have slurs spit at them, who end up beaten to death in a river. From the millions of Natives who have been killed in the largest and longest running genocide in the history of humanity. I won't disrespect them by telling the public how my individual experience has been free of abuse, or laugh and thank someone that tells me I'm too pretty to be Native.  Blair White should be ashamed of herself and the enormous negative effect she's having on the progress that has been so hard won by the trans community thus far. She has no right to do that. She's wrong to think that she has any authority to speak on anything but the privilege she has as a trans girl that looks like a pretty cis girl, and she should be angry on behalf of all the trans women who get abused and treated like perverts in wigs, because they don't look like her.

I saw her video about 'detransitioning' and she isn't even going to detransition. She's simply going to stop taking hormones and try to get her sperm count up to hopefully be able to reproduce. She is still going to identify as a woman. She just wanted to use the whole 'LOOK AT ME I'M DETRANSITIONING!!!' thing as clickbait and thus adding more negativity to the trans community because 'Oh look, another transperson who regrets transitioning!' and it really just gives those people who hate transfolk more reason to believe that people who are trans shouldn't be taken seriously and are mentally ill.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

With the whole positivity-only-movement, not-happy people are perceived as not cool/chill and it's all around irritating that I can't be unhappy or depressed or anxious without being told it's up to my thoughts. In a sense it is, I'll admit. How does one get another one out of denial? Talking about your real life experience doesn't seem to help, even though research in discrimination says that is what helps - telling the person oppressing you how you feel when you're being oppressed. But the sick victim-shaming still happens, and the oppressed is then endlessly mocked, blamed, and bullied. I wish there were a magic sparkly that could bring people out of denial of other peoples' and their own experiences and pain.

"No trans person should ever be physically assaulted -- not even by another trans person -- or randomly for being trans Even if you are a scientist who can prove there only two physical genders, with rare biological exceptions, and that most people's identity corresponds to their physical gender according to statistics  There is still no reason to assault someone (that scientist never said there was) Nor is there justification for being rude and passive-aggressive to people for being trans or any other reason Yet we all know people who can be rude and passive-aggressive, and that includes various forms of people on the gay/trans spectrum But there are serious problems with attempting to pass any specific LAW to outlaw rudeness, because it can be so subjective and because being passive-aggressive is by definition not aggressive and cloaked, and therefore a person who identifies as a victim of passive-aggressive behavior has to make a subjective determination that said behavior or pattern is in fact aggression of a 'fake-passive' nature and not an innocent mistake or other motivation, such as Lindsay Shepherd playing part of a TV documentary that was post-facto determined to be potentially insensitive to trans persons even though no trans persons in that classroom complained of 'feeling marginalized' and EVERYONE (god knows I did) feels marginalized at times, I just lacked a specific protected status for when I was a terrified pseudo-Aspbergers dweeb largely isolated from all my peers during school, terrified of saying something that would make me look stupid or weak. Passing a Law to clearly outlaw rudeness would be as difficult as trying to pass a Law such that a Board defines who can and cannot be defined as gay or otherwise determine their specific gender orientation.  Passing a Law to outlaw rudeness would result in applications based on an excessively wide net or excessively narrow net. Like if it was punishable to wrap a name in 6 parentheses to marks something or someone Jewish, how could it not be punishable for a Jewish person to wrap their own name in 6 parentheses?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's funny watching these older videos where Contra is like, 'What me? Trans? No no no no no!'  On a slight tangent, since starting to watch these videos I've been considering re-creating my Freddie Mercury costume and posting it on Instagram, just to annoy those people who get bothered by gender bending. (I love playing Queen bingo when watching these videos). I wore it for a party with supposedly totally politically right on friends around 2001. I was surprised by how many people were really quite disturbed by it. My ex-boyfriend stood across the hallway from me for about ten minutes grinning inanely at me, then finally said, 'That's really. Fucking. Disturbing. The best thing about that costume is that I coudn't work out who you were for ages.' Mind you that is nothing to my shock on finding that  some people of similar political background to myself, (Anorcho eco activists), turn out to be raging TERFs. I don't think I ever really appreciated how difficult people find it to deal with when you don' t fit into the binary, even though it is something I have lived with all my life, not being considered a proper woman and all just because I have opinions, fail to remember to be not as good as men, and like playing football etc.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm kinda late on this, but I'm going to go ahead and say that Blaire White has moved me to the left on trans issues. I've seen a few of your videos where you criticize Blaire and/or other conservative* trans activists for not challenging the preconceptions of anti-SJWs. However, for myself and a lot of other scummy shitposting assholes, having someone we agree with from an 'outgroup,' in this case from the trangender demographic, makes it far more natural and easy to empathize with OTHER transgender individuals.  The three biggest cracks (on this website, at least) so far that have helped break me out of a more conservative mindset have been, in this exact order: Bearing & others introducing me to Blaire White, the reconciliation and understanding between Sh0eOnHead and Milo Stewart, and your INDESCRIBABLY HIGH PRODUCTION QUALITY, JESUS COCKSUCKING CHRIST!  I might be representative of a lot of people, I might not. But I know that I've become a much more sympathetic individual towards all trans men and women because of the very people you parodied with that 'Tiffany Tumbles' video. I also know that a couple of my friends and a couple other people on YouTube have gone through similar ideological shifts for similar reasons.  You probably won't notice this comment, since it's on such an old video, but there is an entirely valid place in the transgender movement for people like Blaire. Without the 'cool' people helping to acclimate people like me, very few of us would ever get out of our ideological comfort zones.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a largely pre-anything permanent transguy who really does not get seen as a man by the vast majority of people around him, I just find it odd that she seems to be one of the few people who feels like what she is experiencing (the coddling and infantilization of women) is privilege. You can easily find dozens of other transwomen discussing how that they simply lost privileges now that they are viewed by the general public as if they were cisgender women. They are taken less seriously in social context, coddled, more likely to be publicly sexually harassed, paid less, among other things. While, in contrast, transmen discuss being taken more seriously, treated as though they are more knowledgeable (despite the same level of knowledge), paid more, etc. I suppose, being white and being a person with a lot of luck when it comes to passing, she just is denying the oppression that others experience, which is really sad to see. You can also see that Bearing is simply using her as a tool, while she just giggles in response to being used as a 'token trans person' to justify whatever crap he wants to say/ask and that's kind of sad.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Probably because of TERFs and the somewhat common feeling amongst transpeople that they are the overlookes LGBT letter. So a lot of transpeople probably feel a bit alone in their fight. I know I certainly do some times. It does feel like that I'm almost always the only one in a thread arguing for trans rights and against the normal ideas about gender.

"I felt it appropriate to separate my praise for you and this video generally from a grievance I have with a specific facet therein.  Around the halfway mark, you separate yourself from transfemmes and refer to yourself, to paraphrase, as 'just another crossdressing pervert of the kind who probably shouldn't be in women's bathrooms.' Your cognizance of your seperate-ness from trans people and your position hence as an ally is appreciated and, sadly, quite rare.  However, during this segment you use a few clips, one of which is from the rocky horror picture show.  I would like to point out that this character is, in fact, considered a transmisogynist caricature by many, including myself, and Frank N. Furter's appearance in this segment tinges a lighthearted joke with some quite unfortunate implications as a consequence.  My position on this is further supported by the fact that the character's creator has, despite being nonbinary himself, overtly stated that trans women aren't real women. (source: URL  To quote someone else who relays experiences I myself share almost to a T (pun intended):  'Dr. Frank-N-Furter is not an example of positive queer representation. He is a ton of shitty, old-fashioned queer exploitation stereotypes mashed into a single character. He's a vampy, cruel, selfish, abusive, violent murderer and rapist. Y'all, he rapes people and keeps sex slaves. Not a role model.  I understand that RHPS was integral to the coming-out stories of a lot of my queer friends, even some trans ones. I realize that some people, decades ago, looked at Frank and saw a brave, unapologetic gender-nonconforming person with brazenly displayed sexuality, and they said, 'Hey, I can do that?'  That's not what young-me saw when I looked at Frank and characters like him. I saw a cruel, unapologetic gender-nonconforming person, grossly over-sexualized and inconsiderate to others, and I said, 'I can't try to be a woman - people will think I'm him.' [I'd like to add that this particular paragraph hit home exceptionally hard for me. I was rarely exposed to transness as a kid/adolescent, and the only three times I'd seen transness depicted were in two horrendous family guy jokes and RHPS. All of these experiences pushed me further back into the closet and exacerbated my self esteem and identity issues for the precise reason mentioned here.]  Characters like Frank set the tone for queer characters in media for decades, as well as the conflation of transgender/transsexual women and transvestite men. To this day, transgender women like me are thought of as inherently sexually aggressive, our gender identity based in fetishism.'

"People like Blaire- gatekeepers and respectability-politics-touting lateral violence perpetrators- are generally known as 'truscum'. They tend to be among the cosiest with reactionaries in this way.  I've heard overt violence against nonbinary people specifically termed 'exosexism'- although my knowledge of the term's origins is purely anecdotal.  What Blair says also has a profoundly destructive impact on transfemmes and nonbinary amab folk who do 'pass', however. All trans people are subject to transphobia, but amab trans people are subject to transmisogyny as well. Blair's statements victim blame and gaslight the horrors that many dmab people who do in fact 'pass' face, and essentially amount to 'if you're victimised in any way it's because you're not a good t***ny and you just need to git gud at this whole gender thing.'   Communities have a depressing habit of violently striving to throw their least 'respectable' members- trauma victims, loud controversial activist types, people with mental illnesses and physical+mental disabilities, people for whom the community's oppression intersects with other oppressions- under the bus.  It's important to call this kind of behavior out and advocate for those of us in the community who don't often get that kind of respect. I love your content, appreciate an actually respectful look at who we are, and love the balance and civility you bring to a discussion fraught with the precise opposite.

"Well as another fellow slightly crossdressing leaning person who is gay,  I can say that Blaire is a fresh breath of air because she doesn't use  trangederism as some sort of crutch. She can be reasonable and she  doesn't get easily offended. Even if she wasn't conventionally pretty, I  still would listen to what she had to say.   The problem with a lot of trans people is how they revel in Victim-hood and that is what turns of people when they see it on a daily basis or in the case of Youtube, see it on constant video after video which is eyebrow raising because you'd think they'd be one of the first people (along with us gays) to develop that thick skin in a world that may not be the most accepting.   But I can say that other than the  occasional rude commenters, a lot of people have become a little more open to trans people and will give them a listen if they can explain themselves in a well-thought out manner instead of raging angriness.   However, most people are going to be against transtrenders like Milo Stewart or Riley Dennis and there's no getting around that. Heck, it's no surprise trans people like Blaire despise them with their insistence of 100+ genders and don't forget Milo Stewart's infamous quote of 'all white people racist, all men are misogynistic, all 'cis' people are transphobic'. When you start off with something like that, you shouldn't be surprised when people don't want to listen to anything you have to say (not that it would help because a lot of what she says is just... Dumb but I digress).  And the other fact of the matter about the whole 'passing privilege'. I do understand that hormones and surgery do cost a crap ton of money but what with makeup tricks these days, it's a lot easier to go half way and paint your face to look more of the gender you identify with (both for women and men). Saying that, I know there is someone out there who's going to tell me that not all women are feminine appearing and not all men are masculine appearing, I get that. I really do (I'm a feminine appearing guy).  But my point is that if you're a transwoman who doesn't make any effort to look remotely feminine, you shouldn't complain if a few women are freaked out of you going into the women's restroom. I don't hear as much backlash from men like I do with women but I think it's because a lot of transmen do put in a little effort to look at the most, boyish. But my point is, if you're a transwoman with a beard and just look like like a feminine guy, it's better to use the mens restroom because it'll be less of a hassle instead of potentially making a scene in a women's restroom.  Anyway, it was certainly interesting to hear the other side, you brought up some good points and I agree with a few but I still feel the way I do about Transtrender people who are playing make believe with their 100+ genders and sexualities.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"A trans person is a trans person. they don't change gender. It is as simple as that. Should trans people be treated as shit? No, but why get offended? The Joker from the Dark Knight resonated with a lot of people and part of that was because of that line... you know that line right? 'Why so serious!?' And that is basically what we have here. People take offense. Why take offense? If you can take heckling then you aren't falling to the mass ridicule but if you make a big deal about it then you are just being autistic.  Just look at yourself in the mirror. You look like a guy and you are a guy.  If people tell yo to your face that you look like a man, would you take offense? Does the truth offend you? In the case of the example I just posed you likely not... but then what if you did? Taking offense at being told the truth and then going on about how much of a victim you were because of this...  That should explain it.  Basically, if you aren't acting like a piece of crap... then that is cool.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

People like Bearing and Sargon are certainly abrasive, but I think there is a logic to what they are trying to do ABOVE just merely trying to bully and offend.  Do they bully? Possibly (maybe even probably), but I don't think they're bullying out of spite. I genuinely don't think they mean people harm, and I think they are trying to address ideas. (Lets not forget how intense someone like Isaac Newton could get in an argument. Many arguments with Socrates became quite personal, I'm recollecting Socrates' encounter with Callicles...) I think you can see that.   Since most people who hold your views cant see that they're not intentionally malicious, you are in a particularly unique situation where they might actually be willing to actually listen to your criticisms.  I don't expect that you are planning on doing this, but please don't stop the dialogue with these guys. I think you can add a much needed perspective to what they are saying.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"78% of Trans people have been harassed for their gender identity. I'd bet that so have 78% of cis people. The question is: How do you deal with it? Do you WANT to be a victim, or do you brush it off? And yeah, I get that brushing it off is easier when you didn't choose your gender, we know from psychology that whenever choice is involved in something, we tend to be more vulnerable.  Eventually, playing the victim card over and over again and rubbing it in people's faces gets old eventually and there is a push back. And hence, people who just act normally and don't abuse a victim status that everybody goes through from time to time despite having a gender or ethnicity that would allow them to become cool.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I think you made a lot of valid points. There are extremes on both sides and they're equally as wrong as each other. Of course trans people have valid issues to complain about and we should be respectful of that, likewise of course there are some people who take their victim mentality too far and complain about almost everything.  To offer a different perspective here, I think Bearing would see his channel are more of a comedy channel. He's picking out the extremes on purpose so he can make silly response videos back to them for entertainment. He's videos wouldn't be as humorous if he was stopping to clarify exceptions where their might be real issues every 30 seconds.  The truth is right now the extremist SJWs are ones holding the political power. I think there is reason to suggest they need to be ridiculed to some extent to protect everyone else's freedoms such as freedom of speech, which arguably a large number of SJWs are fighting against. I guess I agree there are issues on both sides, but if you're going to pick a side to criticise I'd argue the SJWs are the ones who need more criticism right now. I'd be interested to hear if you'd agree or not?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"People in general need to just calm the fuck down across the board. From proud shitlord to SJWs and all across the spectrum. I tend to fall in the Dave Rubin camp, where we want to avoid truly offending anyone, but realize there are bad ideas. Not every trans individual is going to pass perfectly, but if someone accidentally screws up pronouns. My dad is short with man boobs and luxurious wavy hair when it gets long, if someone calls him ma'am, it's not a big deal. If I came up to Milo Stewart in the street my initial reaction would probably be to call him her. If corrected I would change. Same with Genderterroist. Sorry but when I see broad shouldered hairy dude I'm going to use masculine pronouns. If they say call me Sarah duchess of York, I'm gonna be like, cool Fergie how you doin. I understand why the shitlord backlash exists. I used to be a social justice advocate until I realized being a decent person isn't good enough for that crowd. I Used to be a feminist, but then I got to know the crowd and realized I refuse to fight for someone's frothing idealogy. I am a human rights advocate. Period. If someone is legitimately being oppressed I will have their back, but I can no longer stand by and support the victim narrative, nor the cultural relativism arguments.

"While I don't really agree with all of your interpretations, here, you do pose some interesting questions, and so I'd like to share a few of my thoughts. I suppose you can consider me one of the Bearing/Blaire White/Shitlord crowd. Hello!  Blaire obviously recognises the privileges she has, and yes, of course people are going to be more accepting of someone who 'passes'. That doesn't make them bad people. Not that I'm insinuating you think it does, but this just seems like human nature, to me.  I don't think Bearing was giving off the wrong message with his stream with Blaire. Bearing is a **very** outspoken Bear, and obviously knew he could be direct with Blaire and that she'd be okay with it. You're right, though. We shouldn't just be walking up to trans people and asking them about their genitals. I don't think this was a fair example, though. I can't imagine Bearing would ever say that to someone he didn't have a rapport with.   As for the question itself; What Makes a Trans Chick 'Cool'? It has a lot less to do with looks, and a lot more to do with general attitude. I think you've somewhat conflated being easily offended with what is legitimate victimisation of trans people. Having legitimate grievances about the struggles trans people face is perfectly okay. The kind of people shitlords such as myself hold a mirror up to are the safe-space loving, trigger-warning using perpetual-victims.  Anyway, despite disagreeing with you on several points, consider me subbed. You seem thoughtful and have an interesting manner about you.

"I've had a few experiences recently involving accidentally triggering SJWs and it does get tiresome but they often realise their mistake and repent.   There are post-op trans women (not trans men since they seem to just blend in and vanish) who feel a (possibly) subconscious need to distance themselves from 'trans', that is, to psyhologically transition away from being trans.  That can manifest as this 'im not a victim' mentality (if one associates being trans with being a victim).     My own experience is that I'm suffering discrimination for acting out in a way that a woman 'should not' act, whether that be from a patriarchal perspective or a transphobic perspective.   I never had to suffer such judgements when i was disguised as a male.    There are certain advantages to being female, yes, people are friendlier, more caring, more talkative, etc towards women than they are towards men.  Blair makes a good point, but there's also the other side of things like men being unable to talk to one as an equal because they are thinking about sex.

I'm also disgusted by fecal matter and rotten meat...which is morally equivalent to being disgusted by poorly transitioned people who spit in the face of the gender binary. Yes, people exist on a spectrum ranging from the (non-existent) platonic male to the platonic female but the gender binary is as real as the x and y chromosomes. Intentionally fighting against this reality will make people disgusted by your appearance and behavior, it's just the way it goes. They have just as much right to be a complete asshole to a fat and ugly person as they do to a gender straddler. It's just not morally right to make people uncomfortable when you can choose to keep your mouth shut.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
