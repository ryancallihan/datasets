"So, I don't know if anyone has mentioned this, but I think you are *far far* more attractive than Gigi Gorgeous, but then I find conventional beauty standards flat, conventional and uninspiring. Like, most 'makeovers', I think the people looked way better *before* the makeover then after, when they look like Beauty School Drones.  Er, my point is not to insult or minimize Gigi, just that standards of beauty can be different for different people. I think you are beautiful, and (for me a much more important standard), you look interesting. Not 'interesting' in that left handed compliment way, but interesting in the sense that you look like someone it would be interesting to know and be around.  Um, I hope that's not unintentionally hurtful.or insulting? That certainly is not my intent. But I struggled over my looks for a long time, myself. I thought I was hideous, and no amount of external validation made a dent. So I understand a little? I hope you get, or are getting, to be comfortable in your skin, because to not be is just *awful*.  Um, I hope I'm not being...weird? Too weird? It's been brought to my attention that my communication style.can be off-putting. I just want to let you know I find you and your aesthetic style (and appearance) enjoyable to look at. I look forward to your putting out another video.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've noticed a trend of this notion that 'beauty equals low intellect' like when people unironically say stuff like 'marry a smart loyal girl' and just theoretically 'fuck a pretty girl' because 'she has eyelashes but does she have brains?' It's dogma spread around by  men who are literally emasculated by a pretty girl. They see a pretty girl and get triggered bc they have this 'no one will fuck me' complex that they believe stems from their looks, and obviously not the big red clown nose that is their shitty personality. So they talk over pretty girls because they believe pretty girls have nothing of substance to even add to a conversation. So they skip the conversation part and get right to 'suck my dick' and then go on Facebook and joke about marrying a fat woman. Boy bye","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I know many women who look like your 'before.' I have a pretty prominent brow and a square jaw line myself. Looking feminine doesn't necessarily mean having a smaller nose, brow, slimmer jawline etc. At the same time I totally get that being trans would make a woman extra sensitive about wanting to have traditionally 'feminine' facial features.

"Natalie I think you need to ask yourself how there are cis women walking around unconcerned with beauty standards. I hear your struggle but don't assume everyone is experiencing that, many women both cis and trans have broken free of this thinking. Honestly it is partly to do with privilege, a lot of people simply have far bigger problems than worrying about meeting conventional beauty standards. I know radfems are scary because of TERFs but I really don't think you should throw the baby out with the bath water so to speak. Radical feminism has a lot to offer on this point. It's a bummer that when you mention women in academia going without makeup because of sexism (which is very true, I'm not disagreeing with you here), there doesn't seem to be any room in your worldview for women who actually don't feel a preoccupation with beauty, or don't conflate conventional beauty standards with actual beauty, or outright reject conceptions of beauty and it's trappings (like makeup), or all of the above. It's in the experience of the women who hold those views that you'll find self-worth beyond the conventional beauty standards designed to subjugate us.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Feminine gay girl into feminine girls here: TBH, the first video I watched of yours was the incel video, and I had no idea you were trans until you said so. Actually, I was thinking you looked the way I wish I looked, and that you were cute as hell (and that your voice was sultry like Emma Stone's). My fiancee and I agreed that we'd both hit that. And I'm new to trans culture, so I'm not sure if it's okay to say, but TBH, after watching your 'Are traps gay' video where you described what a girl penis is like, we agreed that we'd both still be down for whatever as long as the penis is attached to a beautiful woman like you (or you specifically, you gorgeous genius. Call me).   And I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting to be beautiful, wanting to pass (I prefer to pass as straight, especially when I'm in public alone or with my fiancee, for safety reasons), or wanting to change your body/face to look the way you want. You only have one life, may as well live it looking the way you want.   As a cardholding member of the IBTC (34AA over here), and a girl who could definitely look more feminine, I would get a boobjob and throw in some FFS while I'm under in a heartbeat if breast implants didn't give you cancer. And I would be doing that to look more like a normal woman and to fit into clothes better, not to attract my partner or other women more. It would all be just for me.   Long story short, if you want to be beautiful and look like a prettier woman than someone who was born as one, you've definitely achieved that. And there's really nothing deeper into women's culture than an obsession with beauty based on nothing more than achieving the beauty for the sake of it alone. Somehow you understand it better than most women as well, even though you weren't raised as one.   Let me know if any of that was offensive. It's not my intention.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"If you still feel the same way about beauty after saying that beauty is a racist, sexist, ableist, transphobic, fatphobic social construct is it not possible that it isn't racist, sexist, ableist, transphobic, fatphobic social construct at all? That beauty is something else, that complaining about beauty as a racist, sexist, ableist, transphobic, fatphobic social construct is the wrong thing to do, that it makes no sense and why these critiques don't even convince you (the person making them). Now it just might be the leftist mindset, where the whole world is a racist, sexist, ableist, transphobic, fatphobic social construct, so you become immune to caring about these things, but if I were to genuinely believe something was a racist, sexist, ableist, transphobic, fatphobic social construct then I would stop endorsing it, but you don't, you instead put a great deal of value upon it.

"God, even though I'm cis woman who does not experience gender dysphoria, the pressure to fit society's expectations for beauty and femininity is so stifling that sometimes it overwhelms me. I feel indescribably ashamed and disgusted by my facial hair, in particular. I have a lot of it, and it's thick and dark, and I have to shave my chin on a daily basis. And I don't even feel like I can talk to anyone about it because I'm a woman who isn't supposed to have this problem, and it makes me feel ugly and unloveable. I want nothing more than to fork over the hundreds of dollars that I don't have for laser hair removal or something, but then I feel guilty for wanting to change my natural body for the sole purpose of improving my appearance based on societal expectations.

"Just finished this video while binge-watching your channel since yesterday (when I first heard about it), and damn, you are so good! While watching the Jordan Peterson one I thought to myself how you are beautiful, thought about commenting that, but soon realized that this willingness to comment about your beauty, given that I had never before commented on any other female internet influencer's, would be motivated by the possibility that, subconsciously, I may think that as a heterosexual cis male I might want to manifest the approval of your beauty and, by imagining you would take offense or not give a shit, gave up commenting. However, after this video, knowing about your struggles with self image and beauty, and realizing that the Jordan Peterson one was way before your surgeries, I want to say that you were and still are beautiful. Of course you look more feminine according to societal standards, but your true beauty was definitely kept the same.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Is it wrong to actually not care about how you look (mostly)? And not in a not-like-other-girls way? I just don't want to look dirty, and to wear things I like. Jewelry and makeup make me itch. I don't look at my face for long enough to care about my pores or whatever shit my skin is made of. I just like my hair neat and tidy.   This lesbian is chillin'. Mostly. Because my mother constantly gets on my ass about my flat short hair and giant, filled pores. My entire family tells me to grow out my hair if I hate hair product so much.   And yet I don't even want to present masculine or androgynous. I have big boobs and hips (and fat), I already look like a girl in my cis girl body. I don't feel the need to present extra femme.   But I always hear 'you can't get a job looking like that' and 'why won't you just try to wear jewelry/makeup/hair product.' 'Your haircut looks like a boy's.' 'Would you care about what your future possible girlfriend looks like?' (Yes, hypocritically of me, but that's a whole different topic.)  Even when I have had makeup put on me, it feels wrong. Not because it's feminine or anything, just because it isn't me. It's my mom, or my friend, or whoever looking back at me when I'm in makeup. When I'm wearing jewelry, it's for them to know I'm wearing their gift, not because I like jangly shiny things on my person.  I really appreciate your take on this as someone who doesn't feel like I fit in a 'correct' female presentation a lot of the time, with a cis female body, (especially as a lesbian, who always get put in boxes of butch or femme) because of some of the things you talk about.

"So... I am on the (minority?) group that truly, honestly doesn't care about appearance enough to wear make-up. (Does that make me a lesbian?) OK...So. I wanted to tell you this. I am a 34 year old and I never used makeup - except for a wedding or two and when a few parties in my adolescence when my mother wouldn't let me get out if I didn't wear the few layers of whatever... True story. I think I can count the times I wore lipstick with one hand. Again, 34 years of my life (minus 10 when I was too young to?). And I just wanted to say, the reason I don't wear it... is because not wearing makeup makes me feel free.  Oh how I hungered for freedom from pointless worries too... I literally felt harrassed, watched, judged, stared at, unable to see myself in the mirror and not see the flaws, for all my childhood and part of my damn adolescence. I was under a lot of stress caring about those things WHILE trying to care about other (honestly more important, like trying to make the world a bit less shitty) things at the same time. I was miserable and, again, oh so stressed. The social imposition of 'caring' about how I look was unbearable.  Then I realized... if I stopped trying to hide my 'defects', I simply didn't care, a weight was lifted from me. That's not to say I don't care about physical appearance, far from it. Physically speaking, I need to like me... but I honest to god feel like I have an easier time doing that if I stop trying to look for flaws to correct/hide. Because if I had to hide one flaw, I had to hide all. And we all know we are going to find another and another thing, obsessively and fuelled by all the insecurity that will always fixiate on something and is never going to go away. Honestly, less time-consuming and productive - and healthy! - to just stop. Oh how I hungered for freedom from pointless worries too...Hey, btw. It did help the whole idea that 'people liking me just for my appearance would lead to a lot of heartache, so I might as well be natural and appreaciate the people who stick around despite it'. The 'appearance doesn't matter' stitch(?), mock all you want but, it is kind of the utter, ultimate TRUTH and savior to me. And something else. At some point, I started to really love my physical appearance. I honestly love how I look, even though my face and body has all the same flaws as before and more. I have affection for this appearance. (I'd hit that... I think I'm kind of a bonafide narcisist.) I see that's not your experience but, I recommend it if all possible. To me, it was breaking the chains of social imposition and self-harrassment. And I could use that mind-burnout for other, better things.   As for validations from others? I got a secret. It's not them being liars: they literally don't care. Everybody cares more about their own personal appearance than how others look to them. Knowing that was liberating too for me, because it looked I could finally stop caring about how I looked to them. (I stopped waxing my legs and walked around trying to see how many people would even notice... even to this day it makes me smile like crazy.)  And I don't want to be cruel, but I associated your old face with your ideas, the experience of watching you all these years, and I kind of miss that face now. Sure, you look prettier now, but affectionately speaking, I grew fond of the other version of you a lot. And that's how beauty is perceived too. Sometimes, it's association and getting used to seeing a face.

"Your statement on why surgery doesn't fix body dysmorphia (essentially) reminds me of the conversation around romantic relationships. You can't get into a relationship expecting the other person to make you feel better about yourself, just like you can't rely on the validation of others to feel beautiful. You have to change your own mentality, learn to love yourself, etc. Even if a thousand people a day tell you how amazing you are, your mind will start to rationalize that those people are lying. It's amazing how many things in life come back to positive self-worth.   ALSO, I desperately want the confidence (and patience) to wear your eyeshadow, because damn, girl, you are gorgeous.

"I was watching this on my TV and I had to pull out my phone specifically to write this comment. 1) You, without your makeup, are 100% organic beauty, and I don't mean that in the empty, mushy platitude way, I mean it literally. Your face shape reminds me of three influential women in my life, My Mother, My Older Sister, and my Elementary school Montessori Teacher. I could totally see you, without your makeup or with light makeup, carting your kids to school in your minivan, dressed in a T-shirt, sports bra, and an ankle length hippie skirt, full length leg-hairs, and unquestionable, rock-solid feminity. I could see you strolling through Wal-Mart, chatting with your sister on the phone as you shop for breakfast cereals, completely unclockable by the average Wal-Mart goer. I don't know if it's just because I'm from the Deep South and we just don't have the same high-level/movie-star beauty standards of  big-city folk, but I totally can't see a trace of overt masculinity in you that isn't present in at least 30% of Cis women. If anybody were to stare at you down here, it would probably be due to your beauty (You're like a Deep South 8.5/9 without makeup, 10 with the makeup you have on in this video), or due to your Cardi-B nails (which are uncommon on the average southern white woman, and would turn a few heads).   2) We all go through a stage in our womanhood (for Cis women it's sometime between Middle school and that first bout of early/mid-twenties weight gain or first time motherhood) where we basically hit rock bottom with our self image, and have to build up a new and better image of feminine beauty that includes all of those gigantic pores, and the stretch marks, and the raccoon makeup of infant-influenced sleep deprivation. It's the stage where we learn to accept ourselves as who we are, not as who society tells us to be. It's that stage where we stop playing dressup with mommy's makeup and heels, and we emerge from our girlish past preconceptions of feminine beauty as beautiful grownass butterfly women who decide for themselves what beauty looks like. I guess for Trans Women, that stage can be way more elusive, so I want to give you some pearls of wisdom. A) most women, especially Cis women, pretty much have that one day out of any given month where they feel totally beautiful, and then it's abruptly followed by PMS and a cycle that makes us feel like dirty trash hobos, so if anything, that feeling just confirms your womanhood.  B) You've done it. You've become a woman. But right now, you're just a low level baby Woman, you have to build up the powerlevel of a high-tier sagemistress. Quick leveling tips: Read a lot of Mommy Blogs. Consider  Motherhood (actual motherhood isn't required, but as a woman you should almost always feel pressured to become one. Idk if you have an elder woman in your life pressuring you to have children like most Cis women do, so I'll stand in). Question your ability to mother (we all do). Come to the conclusion that no matter what kind of a mom you might turn out to be, your womanhood is valid.  Watch the Netflix show Tuca and Bertie. Contemplate sisterhood. Basically consume media made by women for women. The idea is to build a picture of womanhood from the average Woman's perspective, not the image of womanhood that corporations want to sell you. This ultimately will make you feel more 'part of the club' 3) This has been pretty wild and rambley, but I hope you get that the gist of what I'm trying to say is that to feel more like a woman, I suggest that you try to stop thinking and consuming media like a man who is trying to become a woman, and more like a woman who simply trying to be the best woman she can be. Either way, you're already Mom/Sister/Lady material in my book.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've always held the idea that most women wear make-up because they feel insecure about their looks. Not necessarily to men, but to other women. Girls are fucking vicious to one another. You look off for one day and you are called a garbage dump and disgusting. I think make-up's kind of like a drug? Like a psychological drug. Like shoes, or clothes, some girls go all for it and dress stupid pretty and throw on camp make-up and the whole shebang; because it makes them *feel* pretty? Maybe cause it's feminine, maybe because of society? In the end, I've never met a man that actually wanted a girl to wear make-up. It's like a:' Eh, whatever.' kind of thing (in my experience, of course) Too much make-up though, to most, looks really bad. 'fake.' And girls call it that because we know how shallow and insecure we all are we just don't admit it, not to ourselves, nor to others.  I like to think about it like Nutmeg on a desert. The Nutmeg is meant to be a little treat, a little extra special something. It's supposed to take you five minutes. But instead, you throw on 3kg and move it around and paint the poor desert with it to make it look like a queen and then it looks like 90% powder. AKA; bad, fake, powdery, too much blah blah blah whatever you want to call it. Obviously some people like that, and that's fine (however bad it is for your skin) If you like wearing a lot of make-up for a lot of the time then go right ahead.  I just think, instead of wearing it for fun, for a little extra zest, women are wearing make-up because they feel ugly without it. Both because of marketing, other women, and the belief that it will make men think you're prettier. (Which is debatable, but I'm not a man, so I wouldn't know.)    Though I think we can all agree, marketing went ape shit on make-up. Holy damn.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Also, when you talk about the whole 'What do we next?' question. I think for me what has been most helpful in building up new conceptions of beauty is just being around other trans women and pushing past the urge to criticize them. I'm a lesbian and I probably fit in more with your description of grad students even though I'm a drop out.  I think makeup's awesome for some people, it just isn't a thing I've done.   But yeah idk I think if you have an open mind and heart around other trans women you can see the myriad ways people can be beautiful outside of beauty standards. Also, before tumblr canceled the nipple, I would see all kinds of drawings and selfies that just made myself more comfortable with seeing the different ways for women to be beautiful.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"not trying to be mean but trying to understand. I never understood the idea of 'Gender is a social construct but let me get surgery to look like the other sex to use makeup and wear womens clothing'  what  is 'feeling like a woman trapped in a mans body' even feel like. if gender is a construct based on roles and societal rules, why alter your sex and physical attributes to look like the other sex. How would you know what it is like to feel like the other sex? unless feeling like a woman means that you feel like you should be playing female gender roles. But then, Just because you feel like you prefer the other gender role in the construct,(ie feminine demenor, clothing, makeup and hair) doesn't mean you are naturally a female and should therefore get life changing and permanent surgery.   Im really trying to understand transgender side of story if anybody would like to help me out.  It is extremely confusing on how somebody who prefers the opposite gender construct would conclude that they feel like a biological woman and therefore surgery is necessary. i get going up to cross dressing and demenor but jumping from there to surgery is bizzare.

"Regarding makeup: I think the assumption that people, or animals, will stop doing something that they are biologically programmed to do just because a specific stimulus is not present, is flawed. The whole point of something being driven by evolution is that it's innate and instinctual, which means that it will come out on it's own, even if there isn't an appropriate stimulus that needs responding to.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"following you for some years now, always been interested in how you dealt with your transition. it's obvious that you see yourself as a person first (i get that perspective, for example the gender neutral attachment theory helped me with my BPD a lot) and your effective  and successful transitioning as a byproduct of your general development, with an integrated self being the ultimate indicator of success. now having said that. I honestly think you've become quite hot, both in a sexy but also interpersonal kinda way. and this is coming from just a dude who is just okay with his dick (but maybe not with his manboobs, definitely will get surgery at some point). I put this comment about me thinking you are hot to a somewhat open dude on purpose here on this video, with the hope you can feel like 'hey, my personality is well rounded, the body thing seems to pay off, the pieces are starting to fit AND I am getting outward validation'.

"Fun story, I cosplay as Jessica Rabbit, and I'm also in university to become a biology teacher, in hopes to extend that to becoming a Professor. While in cosplay I got in a discussion about philosophy and this man just couldnt seem to believe that a physically attractive woman was also educated. At some point in the conversation it was all he would talk about, and very much turned me off of the conversation in general.  There's such a stupid idea that beauty and brains cant exist in the same person, very possibly connecting to the concept of looking more androgynous or masculine to be taken seriously.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Personally, I believe women wear makeup to impress other women and to compete for attention. It makes sense to think that the women in the prison are so insecure about how they look, they would go at such lengths to gain access to makeup. To wear it for other women, for other people. It's pretty undeniable that with makeup you make yourself more conventionally attractive, you draw in more symmetrical browns, you make your eyes appear bigger, make your lips look pouty, give your cheeks a rosy healthy glow. That's to be perceived beautiful by other people AND yourself. When you're wearing the makeup, you feel more confident, happier in your self and your outward appearance. It's still technically you, but its a slightly better version (depending on the amount of makeup) of you so It doesn't feel disingenuous to many girls.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You know, I've watched several of your videos and as a straight man, a CIS as you like to call us, I have to say I have never, ever met ANYONE who spoke so eloquently, so honestly, so confidently even in your insecurities and so funny with how you deliver your content. You are wrong about things, especially straight guys like me. Yeah, there are plenty of assholes out there that are scared of people like you...mostly because the more you look female, the easier it is for you to 'trick' them into 'doing gay things.' Of course I'm know you understand that idiot belief. But away from those spineless douchebags, there are plenty of straight guys like me who love what you're doing. Also, trans and cross-dressers aren't the only ones that like women's clothing. Personally speaking, I did some acting where I played a split-personality guy who's other half manifested as his sister. While I looked HORRIBLE in drag, I enjoyed it. Nylons are fucking wonderful against the skin. Wearing the skirt aired out my nuts which are almost always a little sweaty. It's not how I would want to dress normally, or even on weekends, but I can definitely see the appeal.   I do have to say that you are a very beautiful girl and you have an amazing personality.  I would feel awkward and uncomfortable because of my social brainwashing to be in a relationship with a trans person, (Yeah, that 'you're turning me gay' shit still has an echo in my white-privileged brain), but I would highly value a friendship with you, and I'm far from alone on this side of the gender fence. I pride myself on being scientifically well-versed, and I know we ALL start out female in the womb, and that a series of genetic triggers must be fired in perfect order to make a male. I get that in trans people, some of those triggers went off, others didn't. There's nothing wrong with you feeling like a girl inside. You ARE a girl inside. Looking at you as a female, you're prettier than most girls born female. I don't see any of the 'aging trans' you talk about. You're gorgeous, don't sell yourself short.  As much as you talk about how CIS guys are assholes, and rightly so, know that you have at least one straight guy on your side who, regardless of your sexual alignment, takes your side on the issue, understands the hell you face every day in a society that says 'you can be whatever you want to be' and then demonizes you for doing it and is doing what little they can to help end the torment LGBTQ people go through. Keep up with the videos,  you're so right on point and intelligent and pretty I'd feel terrible if you left. :)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I agree with a lot of the points made, but I disagree that women in male dominated fields that don't wear makeup are doing it because of pressure to be masculine (or that it's a weird flex). As someone in that situation, in a day to day basis I'm trying to keep up with my peers, and beauty to the extent of wearing a face full of makeup everyday is just not in my priorities because of that. Most of the women I know that wear makeup even admit that they do it more for themselves and other women than for men, so working around all men doesn't create the same desire for makeup for a lot of women.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I just wanna talk about the part where you address women who don't wear makeup. As someone who falls, intentionally, into this group, you didn't address another possibility. Personally, I do not subscribe to the belief that I have to wear makeup to be beautiful. I feel that makeup is a side effect of  society that does not accept women for who they are without tweaking, changing, or enhancing them. I absolutely am not in the Becky category, and do not think makeup is frivolous or unacceptable. Wanting to be more beautiful is a biological need related to the desire to reproduce (ignoring all the social reasons we might want to makeup), and I would never shame another person for wanting to use it. But it's just not for me. I don't think I need to augment my body to be beautiful, and I believe that MY truest beauty is a completely natural one. But I don't shame other women for wearing makeup, and I think it's a great tool for fun, for comfort, for getting that good ole sexytime.

"I dunno man, I kind of see it as 'I can spend 2 hours of my day making myself look 'perfect' and 'pleasurable to myself' or like an artsy moving statue... or I can go learn a skill that actually bears weight in ways other than how I add aesthetic to the room I'm in while to the point I can't touch my face.' Personally, the worlds where etiquette and aesthetic matter are so very, very small, they bear no weight, and everything's been done so many times it's like a pouring a drop in the ocean on collective consciousness and interpreting it as a tidal wave. Look behind the eyes, not at the facade.   I mean this in absolute support: you'll never surgery away the broad shoulders and manly hands, the collar bone or the hips, or the feet. The skull overlapping your face in the beginning kind of resonates with how an obsession with one's image often stems from an obsession with death and the concept of there being a statuesque perfect 'form' of ourselves we must strive to achieve (however conditioned that is by the age we live in - especially for women and other marginalized groups whose sense of identity are rarely allowed to be fully cultivated from within due to outside forces attempting to control that, as we are products of our environment to the degree that environment has power and presence over us - but also subconsciously and in the way we plan things given enough over-exposure).    Almost the whole beauty industry relies on cultivating the inner drives glorified in this video and just about all media, and that's not to take away from the side of it that genuinely restores people to who they should have the opportunity to be - like surgeons who save a kid's life from cleft lips or brings a burn victim's skin back to life, or take care of other severe deformations. I'm still on the fence about gender 'confirmation' surgery (mainly for minors, as there are more obvious issues there) but none of that will ever be my decision to make nor would I ever interfere with personal choices like that for people. However, I still caution that we must listen to and cultivate our spirits away from any and all influences or 'influencers' for as much time as we can, as the universe is a lot, LOT bigger than we can ever see from any one or handful of times and places (e.g. like those cultivated in these series of sounds and images), and so may be our callings. Our consciousness in one moment may be from a completely different place than in another moment, and we have to listen to all of it to know ourselves enough to make meaningful developmental changes to what's really going on behind our eyes in a way that makes our outward affects a lot more, well, meaningful and far-reaching. Pleasure principles are overrated, also, not that I'm some self-suffering edgelord, but I know a lifetime of pain would be worth it if it meant having the time to complete certain missions. Okay that's enough abstract emotion gibberish for one day.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm a lesbian but I'm also asexual. I'm not sure if asexuals can relate, but I have no desire to become beautiful. It's not really out of a wokeness, I just don't really understand what attractive is supposed to look like. I think without a desire to procreate or engage in sex, the standards of beauty become more mixed. that being said, I do love style and fashion and I like being a goth and wearing pink a lot.  I can empathize with the struggle of feeling worthless, it's insecurity rooted in beauty. I also feel like that insecurity is probably tenfold when you're living in a society where most people are transphobic and the rest are cis-people who only value trans people when they pass. And then the outliers who are woke or whatever. I feel like that experience is extremely gripping and almost feels hopeless. Insecurity is a tunnel you keep digging no matter how much you improve, you can only go deeper. That being said, i'm very bewildered by your claim that you have no style. wtf girl, you literally wear cool costumes and have unique over the top makeup. Of course you have style. I'm not just saying that for parasocial reasons. Objectively, you are stylish.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I really like your point about style. I've been pretty active in the goth community for about four years now and I think this is something goths have known for a long time. There is a particular type of goth girl that the internet loves, but most actual goth women are not thin white tattooed women with long dark hair and big boobs. Most goth women are of average weight or bigger, some are curvy, some are not. Fat goth women are not uncommon, and you also get goth women who are very skinny. But none of that matters. Fatshaming within the community isn't so widespread because there is a greater emphasis on personal style, on the development of individual aesthetics, turning your makeup and outfit into art. The focus is on your expression, not your beauty.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"For those who *continue* to walk these wrong paths:  *Get to know Jesus. Now, while you are alive and perhaps have an opportunity. Truly get to know Him. For it is a certainty you will meet Him after this life is over.*  It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.  Hebrews 10:31 KJV  Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,  Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.  *And such were some of you:* but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.  All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.  1 Corinthians 6:9-12 KJV   It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God.  Hebrews 10:31 NLT  Don't you realize that those who do wrong will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don't fool yourselves. Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people--none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God. *Some of you were once like that.* But you were cleansed; you were made holy; you were made right with God by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. You say, 'I am allowed to do anything'--but not everything is good for you. And even though 'I am allowed to do anything,' I must not become a slave to anything.  1 Corinthians 6:9-12 NLT  It is a fearful and terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God [incurring His judgment and wrath].  Hebrews 10:31 AMP  Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate [by perversion], nor those who participate in homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers [whose words are used as weapons to abuse, insult, humiliate, intimidate, or slander], nor swindlers will inherit or have any share in the kingdom of God. *And such were some of you [before you believed].* But you were washed [by the atoning sacrifice of Christ], you were sanctified [set apart for God, and made holy], you were justified [declared free of guilt] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the [Holy] Spirit of our God [the source of the believer's new life and changed behavior].

"New subscriber here. Just wanted to say your channel is so entertaining and informative, I'm impressed. And so professional. I also have those days when I look in the mirror and think it's all wrong, aging and bad. Then I remember that we see all the flaws, all of them, most people don't. And I remember that I'm loved and considered valuable, that I'm kind and intelligent... (Eww, gross!) And that this society, our media and culture is built on creating insecurity. Inadequacy. And desire to emulate celebrities. The world is just... Backwards.  And also I do what I can with makeup and accessories, it makes me feel good. It helps the outside align with my inside. I also loved the conclusion about style!  Yes, you're very pretty, I hope you realize this.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Natalie, a trans friend of mine directed me to your videos after i posted a quote from Jordan 'Daddy' Peterson and it has been a boon upon my life. im a cis white male (i hate labels but i feel like saying that is relevant here) and your videos have been incredibly enlightening to me. i have struggled understanding trans people for awhile now. ive watched some friends transition and have had conversation with a few trans people to try and really understand what it is you guys go through. your page has really helped me do that. i had a funny thought the other day. so many rightists hate the gay and trans folks, but uphold the values of the west. it seems to me the foundations of western thought started in ancient greece with Plato. but any right leaning, trans hating types would fall into hysteria if they witnessed the hedonism and decadence of the ancient greeks haha. anyway, i just wanted to say thank you for laying out all your insecurities, i know thats a hard thing to do. and before you started talking about how all your fans flatter you and you arent sure if its true or not i was actually thinking to myself while looking at you, 'wow. I think i would fuck a trans chick.' XD so, in the off chance you read this i just want to say thank you for all that you do, and that you are beautiful and even though you have a lot of cynicism you are beautiful inside. fuck outer beauty. no, like literally, fuck outer beauty ;) i look forward to your next video.

"Just discovered you, love your videos and insights! :D  One quip with this one, though. As a woman who doesn't wear makeup, it's definitely not for the hipster meta reasons presented here about 'smart grad folks.'  As a kid first experiencing acne through puberty, putting on makeup simply made me feel worse about myself. It made me feel fake and like I couldn't be happy without depending on a thing I didn't even need before. So I stopped like the third day in. I liked makeup as a fun activity for dress-up or Halloween (as mentioned in the vid lol), but suddenly _needing_ it to go outside? Not a good feeling, not fun anymore.  Not saying experiencing middle school, high school, and college with acne scars and no makeup didn't feel absolutely awful either. But I don't know. In a way I feel like I learned to appreciate what I have more. I still have acne, scars, discoloration, and hirsutism now.. but I've found in a way experiencing what I did strengthened me. Probably not any more than the power and confidence makeup can give to others. But just a different perspective is my point, I guess. ^^  Also, vanity isn't inherently a bad thing! I can be real vain about my hair and clothes, lol Many days I spent 6 to 9 hours on my hair, yet I still have a perfect GPA and what not, as though being smart and pretty are mutually exclusive.

"The reason that women also wear make-up when they are not in or do not expect male company, in evolutionary terms anyway, is that they are also in competition with one another. Those females who, through their potential ability to attract the opposite sex, can afford to be most selective and still attain reproductive success are at the top of the social hierarchy. You don't need male company to prepare your group dynamic for the next encounter of a potential suitor This is what puts pressure on women to look good for men even when they're among women. The same is the case for men bragging about their workplace accomplishments, how much they can drink or how much they're making when their among one another - because their dominance is determined, by and large, by power and influence over others, competence and the measurer of it all: money. A person who is home alone and not expecting anybody nor intending to go out will never wear make up. We do it for other people. What else would be the point in looking good?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I want to say something irrelevant with the video. But something I've been thinking for a long time and I am kind of confused. I was thinking that when it comes to art, as time passes more LGBT people get to be represented, and make art and be recognised etc etc. And that is a good thing. But it makes me kind of scared because it seems that the things that are 'cool' and in nowdays (and I am not talking about mainstream art) are those that revolve around LGBT experiences. I mean it's one thing to be an LGBT person and an artist and create art based on those experiences. But it makes me kind of sad when straight people write books about lesbians, make movies about gays, sing songs abouts LGBT experiences in general and so often. It's like my identity as an LGBT person is a means of them making their art hip and cool and woke and serious. And I as an LGBT person and artist I am one that my art doesn't revolve (I can't think of a better word because I don't speak English that well) around my gender or sexual orientation. And I feel less 'cool' about that. That people are going to be less interested in me because I and my art don't fit their stereotype about queers making art.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I loathe the idea of beauty ideals, I was a caricature artist for 10 years and many women were uncomfortable with the way they looked, and most men didn't seem to care at all. It's pretty obvious that our society and corporations put immense pressure on people to define what is a ' good enough woman' that even in prison with no men around, women are still uncomfortable with the way they look.  Everyone I drew was a composite of feminine and masculine features, often the prettiest people had an interesting mixture of both. Trying to purify yourself of all feminine or masculine traits will only turn you into a caricature of what you think those genders should look like.  I watched most of this video without one mention of 'subjectivity' as we all agree on what constitutes beauty and we don't all agree it's vast;y different. I grew up convinced I was ugly because I looked kinda like a snaggle toothed orc and it took my experience of a caricature artist watching all these beautiful people hating themselves to figure out that I couldn't get a date because, I wasn't putting effort into getting a date, I was ignoring people who did want to date me, and I didn't conform to anything and enjoyed my status as a goofy weird kid.  What I found out is beauty is the search for a ideal that will never exist, you will never be happy chasing beauty because true objective beauty does not exist. What I found out is there was a flavor an aura I wanted to promote as my look and I've been satisfied deeply just going for that aura, I grew up thinking I had to dress manly and now I wear whatever I want to defy anyone who tells me to fit into any kind of mold, still resting within that look I'm going for.   if you have a look or an aura you want to portray I think that is an achievable goal, but to be 'beautiful'? That's like saying I want to be ' the most manly man to ever man' I DONT NEED TO BE THAT,  what I need to do is be the best version of me that I can be, embrace my flaws and make them work, show people what I'm about and stand my ground.  Natalie you were beautiful  ( to me ) before and you are beautiful now, and if the surgery made you feel more like you that's great. But I advise you to let go of 'beauty' ideals and focus on what's the most 'Natalie' way you can present yourself, if you're doing that you will be always beautiful to people who you were meant to be beautiful to.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You sort of imply women's concern for their appearance is more noble than men's. Straight men also care a lot about their appearance when there are only men around.   Also the 'incels having sex won't make their lives more meaningful' comment wasn't very thoughtful. There are just few people for who having sex doesn't add to their life's meaningfulness to one degree or another. Also the incels see someone choosing to have sex with them as validation; it's not so much about the physical act as the way it would make them feel valued. I think it's a little cruel to be flippant about that.   Why is wanting to look good ever 'shallow'? Anyone in their right mind wants to be intelligent, healthy, fit, happy, and beautiful, among other things, and wants those things for people they love.   Is the 'aymak' thing an in-joke?

"I love makeup videos.  So I clicked onnthos video to see what this was about.  Did not expect the young woman to mention she was a trans person.  If she hadn't mentioned it, I never would have known she had urgery for facial reconstruction due to gender transition.  All I saw was a lovely woman discussing plastic surgery.   I wish you happiness and health in this life.  The idea that women seek approval for our appearance is ingrained from cultural standards thay span millennia.  It doesn't matter whether you were born male or female.  The pressure to present oneself as an attractive person is reinforced by the advantages that attractive people are given.  Superficial or not, one's appearance does influence their job opportunities, dating partners and mates, their salary, promotions at work, and opportunities for more on the job training.  We call it an attractiveness stereotype.  I study attractivess and find that a number of variables impact perceived attractiveness, which in turn, leads to either access or denial of important resources.  Transgender, cis gender, and so forth...are all judged based on aspects of their appearance.  Frankly, I find it depressing, but the research is clear.  Women wearing natural makeup (whatever that is) and glamorous makeup (think a well done smokey eye and nude lip look), are rated significantly more attractive, trustworthy, and competent than the same women presented without wearing makeup.  No such effects occur for men.  And in my research we found that men and women provide higher attractiveness ratibgs for a woman with long hair than the same woman adorned with short hair.  So hair length and makeup play a role in perceived attractiveness, which impacts the job opportunities and access to resources for women who display these cues linked with fecundity and youthfulness.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Then, I became Catholic; I joined a Church that has some rigorous teachings on human sexuality, and have personally come to terms with these.  There's a voice inside me that wants to plead with you to reconsider your transition.  Otherwise, I'd like to posit that one can, and should, make efforts to look attractive somewhere between the extremes of 'obsession with beauty' and 'the futility of trying to stop caring how we look.'

"If you can't tell what beauty is (for you) such that you need other people, then who are you trying to be beautiful for?  If it's you then you have a goal that's unachievable because you don't know what it is. If it's other people then why are you cratering your life to reflect superficial charateristics for others? This kind of external validation seems unhealthy to me - put your foot down, take control, choose to stop (would be my plebian advice).  Also, I'll try and give you what you want - honesty. I'm a strait man and you mostly look like a cute woman to me (mostly). Sometimes my eye catches a bit of maleness and the cuteness equation changes a little, but the female outweighs the male pretty consistently to my eye. I've also only seen you at the angles in the lighting you have in your videos, so things would probably change in person. I'm not saying this to be cliche, it probably sounds hollow, and you probably won't accept it, but I honestly think you are fine the way you are, you are beautiful. The art you make is beautiful. While I don't agree with your lazy use of trite labels like 'fighting facism' and the like, you are great! So just be yourself and everything will be ok. If that means constantly toiling over beauty then it is what it is, but try not to beat yourself up too much. (I get pretty frustrated about things sometimes.

You know, I just saw a woman.  A very attractive woman.  After watching enough more to better understand who you are, something very real has changed in me, a heterosexual man.  Admittedly an older man, but not dead yet.  For the first time in my long life, something or some things that you said, helped me to understand that you (and if you then surely many others) in a very genuine way have always been a woman.

"Yup. It is a properly worthwhile philosophical puzzle. A maze. A worthwhile maze. A maze with no exit, or a maze runner who insists on ignoring the exit...not so much fun. Worthwhile = difficult. Here are some solid walls that underpin the maze.  1) Human beings and multi cellular organisms generally value beauty relative to other valuable things as part of the wider continuum of valuable things. 2) People also value wisdom and courage and sobriety and wit in that wider continuum. 3) Aging and death is a thing. 4) People are an unstable coalition of conflicting moods and impulses. 5) People contain a divine spark and consciousness of a duty to honour that in each other.  Those 5 points there are plenty enough to focus on. Beyond that? Just a mess of dead ends really. What? Those 5 points are not hard boiled grim reality enough? Beyond those 5 points is a whole mess of confusion. Confusion is.....hmm...what's the word?...' Messy' maybe? I think ' ugly' is better.

"I want to thank you for sharing your journey. As a cis gender, straight female, I had the privilege of being brought up with the discrimination and mixed messages, you only had inflicted upon you as an adult. You did not have the life-long preparation for the kinds of issues women experience that cis women are trained to expect. I can only imagine the mental games this might play out in someone's mind.  Your videos have really helped me gain a better understanding of the 'plight of trans' (for lack of a better term). I won't lie and say that I completely 'get it.' I will however, say that I have much more respect and appreciation for your experiences as a woman, after watching your evolution via youtube video. I have known trans people before, but never had an appropriate opportunity to engage in an honest discussion of the subject with them. So thank you for the perspective.   By the way, you are beautiful. I will likely comment more on the beauty issue at another time. For today, I really just wanted to acknowledge your brave journey.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's almost ironic that you skip sunscreen, it's the most helpful skincare product to avoid aging. A broad spectrum with SPF 30 or 50 suncreen protects you not just from freckles, but can also prevent hyperpigmentation and also slows down aging very very much because it protects your skin from UVA rays, which causes aging. Free radicals and break down of collagen also results in your skip losing elasticity, these will cause wrinkles. Also moisturising is important as dryness causes aging as well. Lastly, avoid tobacco, which breaks down collagen, and alcohol, which causes dryness. Especially if your skincare products also contain alcohol, it will dry out your skin. Topical and oral vitamin A can reverse aging and stimulate collagen production and cause faster cell renewal. If youonly take away one thing from reading this, it must be that you MUST use sunscreen, it is absolutely the best at preventing further aging, but only vitamin A can 'reverse' aging. Dear Natalie, you are beautiful and even more so after the surgery, but please use sunscreen, it will keep you beautiful.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As an almost 6ft cis woman who has struggled with alot of dysphoria growing up I understand how hard it can be to learn to like yourself in that manner. I'm gay struggled alot with the idea that people would consider me butch to the point where it stopped me coming out for a long time, and I still deal with it because my wife is alot more conventionally feminine.   You don't have to feel bad for caring about how people see you, find things that make you feel comfortable and enjoy them. Growing out my hair and switching to more skirts and dresses has done wonders for how bad I used to/sometimes still feel.  You like makeup so enjoy it, my sister does too. Pretending that your worried make you petty is a losing game. I wore only Tshirts and jeans and pretended I didn't care what people though of me, and it just makes you feel gross.   Also, and this is not flattery, that fact that people would ever clock you (before or after the surgery) is pretty amazing to me. You don't have any traits that really stick out to me as masculine.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"First of all, Natalie, you're my role model.   With regards to the idea of giving up the desire to be beautiful - I had a couple years where I genuinely didn't care about my appearance at all. Mostly because I was arrogant enough to firmly believe it was a waste of my time. But even when I sincerely gave up that desire, practical consequences followed from not putting effort into my appearance. Now that I've started caring again, people treat me REALLY differently - they take me more seriously professionally, they're more willing to help me, they're more willing to get to know me. Literally just the fact that people LOOK at me more opens up opportunities to engage with my world. When I didn't try, people didn't acknowledge or value me.   And looking good isn't just an obligation. I'm having fun with style and playing with exaggerated femininity. I just want to give my account because even sincerely letting go of the desire for beauty wasn't really a solution. I still had to live in a world that cares how I look and it didn't go swimmingly.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Although I agree with how you wrote the script and added nuance, I still disagree quite strongly with the vibe I get that you 'cant help but conform to societal beauty standards'. I appreciate you water this down somewhat and have more nuance than that, but... no. This is really harmful to your mental health and IMO just not the right way of going through life. I feel like the aesthetic issues you have with your body get blown waaaay out of proportion.   Now, don't get me wrong. If you genuinely enjoy, intrinsically, grooming and if getting all kinds of cosmetic surgery is all you ever wanted in life then more power to you. Plenty of people do things I couldn't disagree with more, but if that's their ultimate turn-on, go for it. What I find harmful is if you don't actually intrinsically enjoy it or find it useful but still do it because you feel pressured to the point of not just doing some nominal grooming but wasting significant portions of your time to make yourself pretty.    A large part of my development becoming mentally mature was figuring out how to 1) regard my own behaviour somewhat objectively, 2) evaluating it and 3) doing something about it. As a male, I have a few issues with body hair and in a perfect world I'd do the full body laser removal, but giving in to this desire would IMO worsen my mental state about it. Right now I have to confront a myriad of imperfections and that's a good thing, it makes me prioritize what is actually important and what's frivolous. If I'd fix that problem, I would find another, and then increasingly less important problems, because that's how the human mind works. It's never enough. You can preempt this bullshit. It's not easy, but, again IMO, it is worth it to become a more in-touch, well-balanced adult individual.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I don't feel particularly strongly one way or the other about the 'whys' of the pursuit of beauty, but I think the objection to the claim that we largely do it out of sexual interest by saying 'that's not why I do it' or 'I do it to feel good about myself' or 'I do it out of social pressure' etc. Or basically any other explanation that relies largely on introspection is that it fundamentally confuses both the argument and the context of the academic discipline it comes from.  The argument isn't that women wear make-up or men hit the gym because they're consciously trying to hook people (although certainly some are). The argument is that the fundamental inclination that drives the behavior is rooted in that biological inclination.   The idea is rooted within a view of humans, not as rational actors, but as rationalizing actors.  Just like we might post-hoc rationalize most of our behaviors inaccurately, the same logic would apply here.  We might think we wear make-up or hit the gym because it makes us feel better, and we might persist in doing so even though no potential sexual partners are currently present or available - but the reason this makes us feel good in the first place is because of our internalized discomfort at being 'ugly' - a social construct that we likely appreciate and internalize in the first place because of our biology as it pertains to successful social interactions.   I.E you might wear make-up because it makes you feel good, but the reason it makes you feel good is a response to successfully manuevering social expectations and alleviating a desire for validation that is biologically rooted, without which you and your ancestors likely would not have performed particularly well in the evolutionary race.  It's well and good to object to poor usage and bad faith use of the argument for cosmetic pursuits being sexual driven by sophists like Jordan Peterson, but I don't think we're doing ourselves any favor responding to the reductionist and the most vaccuous version of an argument  if that entails making nearly as vaccuous objections in turn.   The response 'I, to my conscious knowledge, don't pursue beauty to attract others.' is just that - A vaccuous response.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I get why it sounds like you deny the importance of beauty in today's society if you say you need to focus on other things but maybe you don't have a lot going for you in other areas if you start blaming your unhappiness or lack of success on your appearance. If you stop looking at celebrities or social media you will realize there are many conventionally unattractive or average people out there who are happy and successful because they play to their strengths and don't get discouraged because they have imperfections (as we all do in some area). I wouldn't have a problem with people having plastic surgery if they weren't obsessed with their appearance but I think that rarely happens and it just furthers peoples insecurities as you normalize it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"The concept of 'passing' is misleading in itself. It's normal for your identity to be influenced by feedback from others but let's say 30% of people accept as you come out as trans without changing your appearance. then you wear makeup and 50% accept you. Then you have surgery and 70% of people accept you. At what point is it enough, because there will always be people who don't like you no matter what you become. If you can't take the one person calling you a freak once in a while then you're frankly fucked because you will never be accepted by everyone no matter who you are.

People may still wear makeup in contexts where they are not trying to flirt, but I believe that those environments are still competitive, whether or not we consciously recognise it.

"Thank you for this.  As an old cis broad, who peeked at a 7 at my best, I've been in quiet pain watching young trans folk wrestle with beauty=worthiness questions. The solitude of their struggle is what makes me weep. All fems go through this, each journey is painful. A yearslong fight to attain modicum of attractiveness only to have the ideals change just as you reach the old one, sending your esteem plummeting all over again. If I could impart advice to my young self? Work on the outside isnt work on the inside.   Make your outside pleasant to yourself, make your interior human someone whose thoughts you'll enjoy when you're old. They are actually two different journeys. Conflating them is a recipe for disaster. Beauty ideals are fluid, don't cast yours in stone. Take joy in makeup, skin care, shoes, etc. Shave a brow bone if you need to. Present yourself in a way that empowers, affirms, strengthens, but dont skimp on a healthy mind. Your interior self, who you really are, needs as much, actually more, daily maintenance than your skin. No one, trans or cis, stays sexually attractive forever. Working on your inner beauty every day is like saving for retirement. You will be rich when youth is just a memory.   Love to you all.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I used to be soooooo concerned with the way I looked. I would spend hours upon hours in the morning, getting up at 4am, just to put on a perfect makeup look, do my hair and pick out a great outfit. I would run around looking 'snatched', and the looks that I would get were the silent acknowledgment that I was seeking. Not the male attention.   I started a very, very time consuming university program 3 years ago. Since then, I have noticed my efforts for beauty and style going down slowly but steadily. I will go out with glasses, minimal makeup and random clothes from my drawer, because I'm way too busy and my mind is eay too occupied with other, more important things. And I honestly have never felt better about my appearance. No longer do I spend 3 hours every day getting ready. Instead, I devote that energy and time to things that actually matter to me. Learning. Growing. Making changes.   When I was in high school, I was a very good student. I was interested in the things I was learning, and liked to go beyond just the school material. But I wasn't really challenged. The fact of the matter is, if you have time to spend 3 hours a day on your looks, it's because you're not stimulated otherwise.   I am a maths and physics major, and like you, I often struggled with the way women in academia view women who dress very femininely. At first I felt the same way as you - it must be internalised sexism, right? Wearing pants suits and square glasses instead of mini skirts and oversize shades has got to be an attempt to look more masculine, RIGHT? Well, over the course of the past few years, I have become that pants suit and square glasses wearing girl, and I DO find overdressed women at the university a bit funny. And the reason is that I feel that if someone (guy or girl) puts more time and resources into something relatively meaningless like makeup or hair cuts, they cannot be taking their acacemic career TOO seriously. I know this from personal experience.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I, myself, am in the same boat. Know it's a shot in the dark, but would love to hear your take on this. A potentially contrarian video linked below.  URL","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I don't think that anyone wants to be beautiful for beauty's sake.  It's not about aesthetics, it's about power.  Seeking to be beautiful is to seek to have power over others or to feel powerful within one's self.  If beauty were enough of an aim within itself, there would be no standards to adhere to, there would be something beautiful to find in any direction you'd care to look in.  It's like that Twilight Zone episode, The Eye of the Beholder, where the power was held by people who we would consider to be mutant and ugly.  It's really all about power.  If you don't connect to the sense of being powerful within yourself, there is no aesthetic enhancement you can make that will fully satisfy.  People who are most able to move others with their beauty and who are themselves moved by their own beauty are people who have connected to this power.  You can't work in from the surface.  You have to start from within by knowing that you are powerful and that your beauty is a reflection of that, not by hoping to create power within yourself by trying to be beautiful.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"To me the societal pressure to be beautiful is unbreakable, history and mythology (across various cultures) are littered with examples of BEAUTY (male, female, non-binary).

I love the way removing the body hair allows me to feel my skin, and feel more with my skin, although the cost and effort of both removing the hair and dealing with the damage this does to the skin means I can't maintain it permanently. I like to be able to look in the mirror and think I look good, regardless of what anyone else thinks about my looks (although it is nice to catch someone checking me out, too). Of course, if I try too hard to look and feel good, when I'm in public I will be treated as though I have broken some natural law of manhood, because that's supposed to be feminine behaviour. I've even been physically attacked by complete strangers that didn't like the clothes or make-up I was wearing.  Does any of this mean I am suffering gender dysphoria? No, it just means some people are arseholes, and no good can come from worrying about what they think. Know thyself, and to thine own self be true.

"Hey, big fan, but you completely misunderstood what Jordan Peterson meant because whether or not a man has an opinion that they prefer women having no makeup, they subconsciously like someone who accentuates their features to look prettier. Some are so into the females who wear makeup that they don't even think that they're actually wearing it or care less about it because it stimulates their senses. Males are visual, if you're going to let them judge the surface, they will.  You seem biased here, I don't listen to Jordan Peterson that much but I pretty much understood what he meant. It's the same with any other person who CAN'T CHOOSE who or what they'll be attracted to (gays, bisexual, skinny, plump, bisexuals, etc).   I'm a female myself, and even I think makeup is like a cheat to the system. I don't have a problem with it if you're going to wear it on special occasions, but to wear it every day is pretty much like a mask.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hi Natalie & youtube, I agree with your points. I think woman in general suffer from a kind of 'dysphoria' feeling like they are trying to look like an ideal woman. There is an unacknowledged MORAL pressure to be beautiful as woman, and not just beautiful, but in reality, match the valued features of this society by obtaining what is viewed as rare and right--- it's not being pretty--- it's about looking like a certain face, a certain person-- and you're right, if you try, you're viewed as shallow, but most woman have absorbed to some degree through advertisement, the way woman talk about other woman, the way men judge women for 'trying too hard' but laud the 'naturally beautiful' or those who are subtly trying without being obvious... the intense pressure and self-hatred that drives women to wear make-up (some women wear make up for fun or not out of shame but lets acknowledge the woman who feels embarrassed to be in public without it or else they feel unattractive or unworthy of respect), the woman with eating disorders, the woman who shave their natural leg hair, pubes, get boob jobs, vagionaplasties, change their noses, adam's apples (I'm a cis woman with a larger adam's apple... watching your video made it occur to me that you pre-FFS looked similar to me-- I have Jewish heritage that gives me a small bump in the nose, I have a slightly more visible adam's apple), their lips (mine are slightly thinner)... not to look Beautiful but to looks like the image of a certain woman they think they have to be to be 'the beautiful woman'-- in society we relate to these few who fit these beauty standards not even as though they are more attractive, because there are soooo many ways to be beautiful, but with envy.... I've always found you attractive and feminine. In my mind FFS didn't make you more 'female' it made you just a slightly different woman, because, there are so many ways to be a woman. What you are experiencing is what many woman experience-- the rejection of their features. My small lips, my larger labia, my small bumb in the nose.... this miniscule thing about us is wrong-- naturally hairier woman for example, middle eastern women perhaps, may feel shame over hairy arms, eyebrows, or bellies, woman ashamed over their smaller hips or breasts or larger bellies, their lack of thigh gap or smaller butt.... I agree that trans people when experiencing a transition may be giving language to their gender dsyphoria without realizing what they are entering into his the female experience of continual self-rejeciton. In reality, like you said, woman have hair, not all woman are beautiful , there are so many ways to be beautiful, some women look masculine or androgynous and men and woman are still attracted to them... the thing you and many are entering into isn't about being womanly but perhaps the worst part of being female in this culture--- and that's why rich trans people like Caitlyn Jenner or perhaps Laverne Cox I feel are given a level of acceptance by society because they don't just transition to a female appearance, they transition t the 'right' female appearance that most normally won't ever achieve without plastic surgery and cosmetics.... perhaps you've already read Naomi Wolf's book 'The Beauty Myth' talking about how all women are trying to become the form of 'the iron maiden', an image of a woman they torture themselves trying to become..... when woman are still beautiful with all their variations... but we aren't taught to think that. Most woman have a 'dysphoria'-- I relate to your videos even though I'm not trans, and I always have--- someone asked me, why do you care so much about being beautiful... I don't know, because if I'm not, I feel I am viewed by others as worthless... a deep need and despair I can't really rationalize, that I also don't want. And it pains me to see you and other woman feeling the same way, and it pains me to talk to others who don't understand how it feels, like the men I date... what is my point? I don't know. I guess I just wanted to point out how all woman are taught to hate themselves.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hey Contra, I really loved this video and your insight as always. I can't say I have the same experiences struggling with beauty, since I'm not trans, but I do relate to the fact that as a woman, even as a chubby, queer, belligerent feminist and self-proclaimed intellectual, so much of me still just wants to be pretty. You wouldn't know it looking at me since I barely ever wear make up (originally because of internalized misogyny/'I'm not like other girls phase,' but now it's just pure laziness) and I don't often dress well. But a lot of this is because I do care about how I look and the lack of effort is because I've given up and see my appearance as a lost cause. While I know intellectually this doesn't make me any more or less of a person, emotionally I still hate looking at myself in photos and just wish I could somehow become beautiful. For what it's worth, I do think you are a beautiful woman (with an excellent sense of aesthetics). But I also think that my opinion about your or anyone else's looks shouldn't carry that much weight.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"thank you for your honesty, as always. i think as women we feel trapped in our desire to be beautiful more than men do, because history has given great importance to female beauty over brains. women such as marilyn monroe or cleopatra, who are remembered and probably will be for a long time as icons of feminity, are reputed for their beauty, regardless of their power or talent. a woman who has managed to impact the world despite not being seen as beautiful is rarely remembered by her face. i doubt any of us have a clear image of what marie curie looks like. furthermore, women get forgotten as they age bc of the idea that beauty fades with time. i once read a quote that said something along the lines of, when men like elvis or kennedy die, there are always reported sightings and claims that they are in fact still alive. but when a woman like marilyn monroe dies young, people never doubt it. because they don't want to find her having become old. and that's just so deeply set into our brains, that as women we must possess beauty before anything else, and once that fades, we might as well die. cis or trans, the stakes might be different, but all women share this incredibly powerful idea. beauty is our personal god. and i think men just don't understand that. i don't even think many women realize just how much we are influenced by it. there was once a survey asking women and girls if they'd rather lose an arm or gain a lot of weight and almost all of them said lose an arm. that's just womanhood. beauty over function. beauty over self. beauty over life. would you rather die right now or live a hundred years looking ugly? would you rather be twice your weight and have the career of your dreams or struggle to pay rent and be skinny? would you rather be called a bitch or fat? we must all ask ourselves what kind of image we have of ourselves and what self respect really means. i fear for the future of women and girls. i hope my daughter never has to feel the way i do. anyway... you are a smart woman, as you know it, and you have the power to influence many people. i think it's great you made this video bc it forces us to reflect upon an uncomfortable problem we are all facing. so thank you.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've been watching your channel for only about six months. For the record, in all that time, I always thought you were gorgeous, and I think the changes (they are subtle but very effective) have kept you looking like you  only *more* gorgeous.  The thing is, its easier to look beautiful more effortlessly if you have confidence and if your surgery has helped you gain confidence, then you're going to find it more and more easy to look beautiful. As someone whose own mother thinks she's 'just not that pretty, but at least you've got a brain' I think I know a little bit about not being able to judge my own appearance, but I've found that the main issue is that I see the remnants of my teenage face (which was NOT pretty because I was all nose) and can't see past it (pun intended). I expect you still see the remnants of your old face in the one you have now and so you still feel like you've not succeeded as a woman. I 'm sure all your fans (and I count myself among them) don't see that, we see you as you are now, a beautiful intelligent woman. And you can use both your beauty and intelligence in any way you like. Whilst I hope that you continue talking about the kinds of things you've brought up for the last year or so (I haven't watched much before that) if you find another route, i'm sure most of us will still watch your channel because you are so compelling as a creator.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"K, I've been thinking about it, and I have two remaining thoughts.  1) Style norms are still influenced by unjust power structures.  It isn't as if all styles receive equal admiration or acceptance.  You can still be ridiculed, and you can still be disrespected because your style is associated with race, body-type, all that stuff.  Style norms are easier to change than beauty norms though, and one's own style is easier to change than one's own beauty, so I think you are still right to redirect our self image to style rather than beauty.  2) It's not really easy to change our desires directly from intellectual critique, I see that.  However, it is somewhat possible to make a direct change to the way that we consume media, or to some parts of our lifestyle, and that might change our desires.  We might be less obsessed with unattainable beauty if we consumed less media of some types, or contributed to it differently.  I'm thinking, for example, like getting on Insta less often and posting and commenting on fewer 'beauty' pictures.  All that said, I really appreciate yet another thoughtful episode!  That staring in the mirror trying desperately to convince myself that I'm beautiful... Oof.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I feel. Weird when it comes to this topic.   About lesbians and performing gender. Idk how common my experience broadly is. But my gender performance is mostly to reject the male gaze as hostile as possible. Because I don't like men and I didn't like being seen as a girl either.       To simplify much too greatly I'm basically a genderfluid afab demigirl lesbian with several areas of dysphoria. But they aren't really areas makeup would help with. More height and hips kinda stuff.    Growing up unsure of my gender or orientation  I was very confused. And for quite a while I just kinda just adopted a butch identity which just became more distressing as time went on. And even from a young age I always performed that tomboy/butch stuff to the point where it could be considered toxic masculinity. Must hate pink, must reject all makeup, must hate girly toys, must never like the singular female character present for being 'too feminine to be authentic'. I'd take on physical tasks much too strenuous for me to prove that girls aren't always weak and I'm not really one of them anyway. In that same 'not like the other girls' desperation I'd hang out with the bro-est dudes ever and just assimilate their culture and try to top it. Cat calling, unfounded sexual commentary about pretty much any other girl, pretty much all that junk until I was fully accepted as 'one of the guys'. (Behavior that I only really did around them for social approval)  This however did not stop my non friends from looking at me and seeing a small, curvy, shy, girl with soft, fine, long, hair. Tons of sexualization, harassment, 'chivalrous treatment'. Unwanted advice about 'attracting men better'. I chopped off all my hair asymmetrically, dyed it wild colors. Wore baggy clothes. Did everything to look less sexy and less feminine in public.   But at home I mostly liked my body. Not as in how it feels, but looking. Idealic to me and the base that all aesthetic beauty  was judged by and most fell short.    Is it any wonder I developed a split personality and often dissociated so hard that I couldn't recognize myself from Kristen Stewart if I tried? Still can't sometimes tbh.    Idk, but it is bizarre hating your femininity while admiring it in a depersonalized state and wanting to publicly distance from it because of your own confusion and hatred of a label.   With no obstacles in my way I probably still wouldn't get too much surgery. Because it's like a bizaro version of that 'autogynophilia' trope in reality. The feelings are still mixed but I'd rather know I aesthetically like how I look, than hope a surgery might also make me more comfortable socially and in my own skin. I would get chest reduction because it's actually recommended for my back pain plus the dysphoria aspect. Just too scared and no $$.     To many, not wanting surgery, having a gender similar to assigned one, and feeling dysphoria is mostly socially constructed, makes me clearly fake and not really trans. Just a girl trying to feel special.  That was my number one source of actual invasive thinking dysphoria. That if I could just perform gender a little bit *more* I'll finally be accepted as 'not a girl' or 'androgynous' at the very least. Maybe facial hair and men's pants and t shirts. But lol at getting hrt in Oklahoma when you're as 'confused' as me. But no amount of performing by binary standards would work. Especially since I have even less affinity for masculinity than I do femininity.    And non binary standards barely even exist at all.   Now I'm a nudist that spends my time as a shut in nerd writing novels about lesbian  shape shifting dragons and also 1920s au Germany where socialists beat the nazis before they became very popular, when not creating anarchist propaganda for the internet.   So I'm a bit more comfortable completely dismissing the gendered attacks on me in general than most. Mostly because I don't deal with people IRL hardly at all.  Despite being completely ruled by a desire to fit in most of my life.   Distance from constant feedback I think helped. But too much isolation is often unhealthy. But so is being told to kill yourself over a haircut or being blamed on suicide for existing, or being sexually threatened by men thinking rape makes you straight.  so pick your poison, insanity comes either way.   I can feel most of the sides. Dysphoria. Euphoria. Indifference. Contempt. Escapism. Essentialism. Constructivism. I've felt and rejected them all on numerous occasions.   But I still don't really know how I should feel about gender dysphoria compared to other social or body dysphorias. Literally the same? Different in some way?  Is there gender dysphoria that exists when gender isn't assigned by physical traits  or at all? Is there any material basis for gender as we understand it at all?  Mostly I feel like 'it's all arbitrary and entirely social until it's made pathological by popular demand'. But is that just my own bias saying I'd be fine if I never internalised anything gendered?  It's still confusing to me lol.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I really don't understand why I'm like this now.  Like I said, I'm ACE, I really don't give a shit about getting laid, but being conventionally attractive is somehow desirable.

"I personally don't think that beauty is a bad thing to strive for, depending on one's mindset, and I certainly don't think you should be ashamed for wanting to be beautiful, even if it does fall into the whole 'society sucks' thing. Think of it as a hobby or just a casual past time, another way to improve yourself. There are many things which go into the visual beauty of someone which can have positive effects on their health. For example, about a year ago I was quite fed up with how skinny I was (and my mom telling me how I looked like a twig every other day) so I started working out regularly, and it felt great after a few weeks! It improved my outlook on life, I felt better about myself, etc. I was getting closer to the look I wanted for myself. So you getting surgery to pursue the look you want for yourself shouldn't be something to be ashamed of. I don't quite get the whole fat thing, as I don't think anyone should strive for being overweight, it simply isn't a healthy thing to do, however if that's what someone wants to look like, who am I to say they shouldn't do it. It's their body after all, and I think this train of thought should apply to everyone who strives for their personal standard of beauty.   Moreover, I wouldn't worry too much about getting old, there are a number of technologies pretty close to being just around the corner that will be able to repair cell damage on a body wide scale, leading to effectively aging being reversed. So as long you live until the first wave of life extension technologies, I would say you are set. I also think that on the coming decades there will be ever more artificial bodily modifications available on the market, think synthetic skin or digitized tattoos or stronger limbs. So if you aren't satisfied with your biological appearance in the future, just swap it out, problem solved.   Finally, I really do agree with what you said regarding style. Having a good sense of unique style can easily do as much to enhance the appeal of someone as if they were attractive to you. For example, I once saw a group of people walking around some galleries while I was working as a guard at a museum, and most people who came to the museum were dressed pretty average. Even if they were attractive in my eyes, I got used to this sea of people after a while. However, in this group of people I saw this one time there was a middle aged women, if I had to guess maybe in her 40's, but god damn she was dressed so well that she looked way more interesting than anyone I'd ever seen. Distinct but not shouty, refined but not boring, it was amazing really the difference that it made, and I thought 'man I wasn't expecting to ever see an American composed this well'. Later I over heard her speaking on the phone while I was making my rounds, and of course, she was speaking Italian, ahh what was I thinking after all. Anyways, my point here isn't to try and make fun of Americans (ok maybe a little) but to illustrate how much of a difference having a unique and individual style can make. So pursue beauty, but pursue it in a positive way, it need not have all these negative connotations, make it a personal thing rather than a societal thing and hopefully if enough people do it that way we can eliminate a lot of the societal taboos and biases around this concept, and be all the better for it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"for me personally, I spent a lot of my adolescence worrying about being beautiful. I thought it, along with being fuckable, were the only measures of my value. I eventually figured out that other things make me happier than waxing my snail trail and that I don't feel like the real me when my freckles are covered in foundation. I feel more confident a lot of the time without makeup on, and I think part of that is it makes me feel less restricted to femininity. However, I do tint my eyebrows because I think it ties my face together nicely and I'm blessed to have naturally banging hair that requires little maintenance so it's not like i walk around totally a-gender.  not that I want to compare my experience to yours, more to your characterisation of 'not like other girls' grad students who don't wear makeup.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"In a way I feel bad. Cause I know that both my transition goal and my idea of beauty, is pretty damn close to society's assumption of what non-passing trans women look like. I'm not saying it can't feel like absolute horse shit to look like a hairy, deep-voiced man in a dress if that's not the kind of look you're going for, and I hate society's shitty treatment of non-passing trans women as much as anyone, but I still feel bad about having made it into an aesthetic and I'm not sure what I have to say in my defense. It's... just one of those nonbinary things...?   Also it's not really all in my control that 99% of random people I run into always assume that I'm a trans woman and ask me if I got my dick cut off yet. But they tend to look quite baffled when I respond that I've never even had a dick. Yes, I'm afab, transitioned with testosterone and loving those male traits I got, and I've got a thing for hyper-feminine alternative fashion. Put all those things together and I do look like a bad stereotype that'll haunt you in your dreams at night.  The false assumption that I'm a trans woman is so far away from my reality that it almost comes full circle. Cause this hairy, deep-voiced, 'non-passing' mess with boobs in a dress that I am, is my actual transition goal - not my start. But there's nothing I can pass as, being nonbinary in this way. So what then, if the societal beauty standards don't apply to me, and because what allievates my dysphoria is making me destined to live the rest of my life being falsely assumed to be the very kind of person (gender wise) that society looks down upon the most? Well, then I get to deal with the social repercussions that are not even targetting me.   But I'm already beautiful. I see it in the mirror almost every time I look into it, but most importantly I can feel it. I mean I don't even mind my flaws. I display them carefreely. So I don't need beauty in the way society tells me... just hand me a damn flame thrower! (Also I'm a lesbian, so you're quite on point about that too.)

Instead of viewing it as the next thing to feel guilty for, the ultimate oppression dynamic, how about you try looking at it this way: There are valuable things which are in different ways a foundation or necessary condition for our civilization.

"Completely not the point, but I really like skincare so here goes: -don't exfoliate your face every day, it's pretty harsh on your skin. When you exfoliate do it on your neck too, like you should with the rest of the products to prevent it from aging different from your face. -there are 2 main types of toner, the western one is astringent (drying your skin out like crazy, often used for acne or last swipes of makeup remover, I do not recommend it but everyone can form their own opinion) and the Asian one, which is meant to return the skin to its natural ph level after cleansing, and hydrate. Some of them focus on acne as well, but it will say it by itself. Sunscreen is supposed to protect you from burning, skin cancer and according to many dermatologists also premature aging (like wrinkles), - that was most likely a joke, but putting it out there anyways since someone I know is dying as a result of cancer and thisone is simpler to prevent-.  Edit: also, sunscreen can be difficult to remove, clogging pores and causing pimples, oil cleansers seem to do a better job of removing it than foam because like dissolves like.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Not that anyone cares, but here's my experience as a 6'1 cis woman. When I was growing up, I was extremely aware of how much taller I was than everyone else. I felt like I simply couldn't be feminine at my height, thanks to the beauty/clothing industry mostly catering towards petite girls. I could never find clothes that fit me properly unless I shopped in the men's section. Due to not being able to find feminine clothes that fit me properly, I was pushed to present more masculine, which just made me feel ugly and frumpy (it probably didn't help that I also had a huge Not Like Other Girls Complex(tm)[?] as a teen).   Once I got to high school, I had the realization that I can still be feminine despite towering over almost everyone. I finally found a pair of jeans that fit and just accepted the fact that every shirt that I wear is going to look like a crop top. I started wearing makeup and getting comfortable with showing off more of my body.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"good vid. but aS A PaTrHiArCaL gAmEr i don't honestly agree with the 'women don't wear makeup to be more cockable': my experience as a person who is starting to care more for its own appearence tells me that what happens is OBLIVION OF THE PURPOSE. You start doing it to get laid/to be more accepted and considered, which is simply a more gentle way to say that you do it to get laid. But any mind cannot contain both the premise 'i do it to please others' and 'i am, maybe, worthy of something, in my good days, probably'. If you follow the path, the second premise will kick the first out beacuse it will just be more consistent with reality and reinforced by it. So you will have to look for another explaination for why you keep dressing good and wearing makeup.  This different explaination very often cannot be achieved, so it becomes a matter of obligation: 'i wear make up because i must!' 'WHAT? going out without makeup?!'.   Another reason for why it becomes an obligation are the social pressures of course. But the way in which the social norms get interiorized by you is always beacuse you want 'to fit in', or the SoCiEtY would have no power on you.   Another reason is just that it becomes an habit. Habit reinforces all the cycle.   This is how, for example, i began to stop wearing dirty old sweaters when i'm at home but now i'm wearing the nice sweaters of last year's collection. I get laid alone at home? sometimes... but i don't need others for that so why am i dressing better than before?   I interiorized the norm. I forgot the puropose. But the purpose was fucking there at the start, it's the core.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I read this quote that really helped me:  'Next time you get dressed, as you apply cosmetics, jewelry or other ornaments, consider that you are dressing your altar - an altar that serves to communicate with other beings and concentrates your power and energy.'    ...and then this article by Jess Zimmerman in Catapult that has CHANGED me (will link, but here is a key excerpt)     'Medusa lost her beauty--or rather, it was taken from her. Beauty is always something you can lose. Women's beauty is seen as something separate from us, something we owe but never own: We are its stewards, not its beneficiaries. We tend it like a garden where we do not live.   Oh, but ugliness--ugliness is always yours. Almost everyone has some innate kernel of grotesquerie; even fashion models (I've heard) tend to look a bit strange and froggish in person, having been gifted with naturally level faces that pool light luminously instead of breaking it into shards. And everyone has the ability to mine their ugliness, to emphasize and magnify it, to distort even those parts of themselves that fall within acceptable bounds.   Where beauty is narrow and constrained, ugliness is an entire galaxy, a myriad of sparkling paths that lurch crazily away from the ideal. There are so few ways to look perfect, but there are thousands of ways to look monstrous, surprising, upsetting, outlandish, or odd. Thousands of stories to tell in dozens of languages: the languages of strong features or weak chins, the languages of garish makeup and weird haircuts and startling clothes, fat and bony and hairy languages, the languages of any kind of beauty that's not white. Nose languages, eyebrow languages, piercing and tattoo languages, languages of blemish and birthmark and scar. When you give up trying to declare yourself acceptable, there are so many new things to say.   You're not supposed to do this, of course. You're supposed to be ashamed of your ugliness. Why? Because it's objectively shameful? Or because it reduces your value as a decoration, a prize, an advertisement--because it benefits nobody but yourself?   Medusa lost her beauty, but she never lost her ugliness. It only grew and grew, becoming something greater than herself but still part of her legend. Becoming, in a way, beautiful--but an undomesticated, frightening beauty, the beauty of Pegasus.    The freedom of ugliness includes the freedom to find beauty in the static and blur. If you stopped laboring over beauty for someone else to judge and find wanting, how much more energy would you have to cultivate your ugliness? To build something you can keep?'

I only disagree with one part: the sly dig you made at women who don't wear makeup before delving into women's relationship with makeup to express their individuality and femininity.   If wearing makeup is an expression of individuality, and your statement about style at the end holds up, why is not wearing makeup perceived as a 'not like other girls' flex as opposed to an alternate expression of individuality? Because wearing makeup is the societal norm? Why give $$$ to a beauty industry created to make me feel like I can't be beautiful without their $45 foundations and fake lashes and eyeshadow palettes and what-have-yous?

"Loved it, especially the end. I like how you dismiss some of that cognitive dissonance at the end, because I've been in the same boat. We can critique things and even wage revolution against patriarchy. But recognizing that beauty is a function of patriarchy doesn't mean beauty standards just go away, and that's okay. I don't like to call it a coping mechanism because of the ideas it evokes, but it's essentially the same idea: making ourselves beautiful, whether we view it as such or not, is a way to cope with the stress of patriarchal standards--some people will reject beauty standards; others will conform. That question is about psychological disposition more than it is about wokeness, though, and it's an important distinction to make for the moralists on the left who want to whine about us being bourgeois or whatever the hell we're doing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There are a lot of trans people that look just like not super attractive women. They, to me, often pass as women who just are just average, but they still get ffs to look like pretty women. A lot of them have boobs from hormones that are the size many cis girls naturally have. But they still get implants. That's okay! It's okay to want to look better!!!!

"Serious question: If I go up to a transwomen in public (which I've obviously clocked or the question wouldn't apply) and give her a general non-creepy compliment like 'I love your hair.' or 'That color looks great on you.', am I going to make her smile at a compliment or just make her anxious that she was clocked? I'm a middle aged woman in a small Southern town, so I know life is tough if you are trans. I'd make that easier if I could. Generally I try to spit it out whenever I think something nice about a stranger, because we all like a genuine compliment. So it's a compliment I would say to any woman. In the video, the 'you can be hot even if you are clockable' was heartbreaking to you. It got me wondering if my good intentions are backfiring too. Should I just go on buying my groceries and mind my own business?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm going to disagree with Natalie here (ooh? Wha?) by stating not a grad student, but as a bachelor's degree working person who presents as female (Non-binary) that I don't wear makeup. And it's NOT a flex about how I'm better than people who wear makeup - it's because it takes so damn long for me to get ready in the morning with makeup. For some people a routine that may add 15 minutes to their day actually takes an hour for me and I am not sacrificing my sleep for that. I'm not a morning person either, so the only thing I can manage to do is roll out of bed, rummage for clean clothes & run out the door. I don't NOT wear makeup because I'm making a statement, I just can't care enough. This is the shit that 2nd Wave feminists were fighting for, the right to wear or not wear makeup or shave their armpits & legs and pubes, and that not being a deliberate statement about their femininity. I love the rest of Natalie's video, I'm not a TERF by any means (I am Non-binary, so it would explode TERF's brains).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The problem with beauty standards, is that I really don't believe they are entirely socially imposed. For instance, the very fact that we as humans even find other humans 'attractive', that we have the desire to put our bits on their bits, is very much rooted in our biology. I mean, what are humans but blobs of organic macromolecules undergoing thousands of simultaneous chemical reactions? The very fact that we find our fellow globs of organic matter appealing comes down to an innate evolutionary drive to pass on our genetic material. Now, even though it may sound like it, I'm no social Darwinist or biological absolutist and I fully recognize that human beings are unique and unparalleled in our capacity for thought, reason and empathy compared with the rest of living beings on this planet; which leads to an enormous degree of complexity that the aformentioned schools of thought often fail to address. However, I still believe biology is an undeniably important factor when discussing beauty standards, and something that is often ignored when the topic is debated in more leftist circles.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I honestly think that beauty should not be thought about in dichotomy but in probabilities. How probable that an individual you find attractive finds you attractive, and to what degree.   There are certain things that are very probable to make you attractive to the masses. For instance, being really healthy or humorous. There are also things that make you very attractive to niche groups, while very unattractive to those outside such a group, such as people who wear lots of pink and frills vs those who wear lots of black and leather. Again, its a likelyhood, not a dichotomy. We also have to factor in what you want to use your attractiveness for. Is it for popularity? Getting laid? Finding a life partner? Getting a certain job? Becoming a pro athlete? The only truly scientific way of measuring your attractiveness would be to compare everything about yourself that could be considered attractive to the ideals of everyone you are ideally attracted to. And of course, each trait has a different level of importance to each other. Some people may care more about how well you cook than if your thighs are thicc, for instance, while others would instantly drop you off their radar if your thighs are small.   Beauty is complicated, and unless you set achievable goals for the beauty you want to emulate you'll never get there. I think that so many people find themselves ugly is they cannot quantify it in any way, and indeed, it is almost impossible to do so.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

You, since you fuss and bother about make-up, must spend a whole lot of time looking in the mirror.  Unwise.  (I myself don't wear make-up.  Never have.  Women will never achieve equality until they, like most men, are comfortable and content with their own faces.)       I have been searching without success for a quote from William James, but it goes something like this:  'Happy is the day when one ceases to care about getting fat and getting older.'

"This is a really fascinating topic because I've always felt really disconnected from these conversations. Not because of a holier-than-thou I'm above that mentality, although it might come across that way, but because it's unattainable. I'm not even in the running.   Most girls won't look like the girls in the magazines because of photoshop, genetics, diet, money, etc. but there is at least the illusion that one day you could be. I won't ever look like the girls in the magazine because of a fundemental difference in melanin. I'm not white. What is considered beautiful--white, blonde, thin--is something I will never be. And that's fucked me up in innumerable ways because beauty equals love and attention and if not personhood at least acknowledgement from men.   I wouldn't say it's freed me, it's just made me kind of despairing and numb in a way I should interrogate far more instead of blindly accepting. I don't know. I've just always felt like beauty was useless and dissapointing because I never saw or, couldn't even fathom someone like me one day reaping it's 'rewards.' It's a shade of the beauty conversation--the forever undesirables because of race, disablity, size, etc.--that I don't see often.

"Social constructs don't change because we want them to, they change because of an underlying change in understanding/meaning in society. It used to be that being tan was super desirable. That changed with the skin cancer awareness & sunscreen revolution. In poor societies, it's difficult to be fat, so that's seen as a sign of wealth and beauty. In our society, overweight is generally a sign of poverty, and fitness a luxury of yoga moms & tennis club dads.   Social construct, sure, but not arising from nothing. Dark eyelashes, red lips, rosy cheeks, clear skin, athletic body... these are all signs of YOUTH. And we are a youth-driven culture more than anything else.

I follow a few trans women on YouTube and they're all gorgeous, but i can't help having this painful tang in the back of my mind that 'of course if you could design a feminine aesthetic, it'd be gorgeous'. The goal cant just be to look like an average woman...it's to look like an attractive woman.

"First off I really do love this video. It's creative, interesting and I really respect the multiple different points you hit.    Some of my thoughts:    I am a female scientist and I don't wear makeup. For me the reason is because I feel the most myself when I'm not wearing it. I feel (and honestly look) like a different person when I wear make up. If your make up is a manifestation of your truest self, that's awesome, it's just not for me. I do love getting dressed, the problem I have is a safety dress code for the lab and also to be honest, practicality issues. I wont wear rings because I have to wear gloves and I'm not trying to loose a ring because I have to take it off and put it back on lol.    It's I think a balance of dressing as who you are without being too distracting if that makes sense. If I'm at a conference I want my work to be the focus not the way that I dress. While the way you dress shouldn't really matter, it does. We are visual creatures and it does make an impression.     I also don't think beauty is strictly sociological. I have a bias towards biology because I study neuroscience but there is some fact to it. I think people forget we are still just animals and that there's an innate force in us to have a preference of a symmetrical face (just as an example). Where the percents of influence lie I don't know.  I would describe it like a flag, the biology is the pole but society is the wind blowing the flag (our minds/thoughts/feelings) in a direction. Does this make any sense?        I think a lot of the self hate is totally manifested through the internet and people just strait up lying as you said. I think people have a tendency to think they are uglier then they really are, due to comparison and face turn and so much other bs. In reality finding yourself is really where beauty lies. It sounds corney as fuck but what makes you attractive is the you-ist you. Unles you are actually an ugly personality too, then you're fucked lol.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm a disabled (fucked up eyes)  cis woman and aside from being blind as shit, I was an ugly duck as a kid and teen so I've heard that I'm an ugly disgusting monster more times than I can count. I tried many times, failed, and in the end  gave up, on trying to fit into glam feminine style and now I have an allergic reaction at the simple thought of wearing a skirt, or fabulous make-up. I've grown to hate both my masculine and feminine traits, because of the weird ass social standards I tried to fit in. So now as an adult in her mid twenties I don't believe any compliments even these from my bf. It's pretty hard to just love yourself these days, and I don't think it's transphobic in any way to want to look as feminine as possible. I myself needed to accept my androgenous traits and start to tolerate that I'll never be the girly bubbly beauty queen that all of my friends back in highschool were.  When I crossplay on conventions and see young girls have shiny eyes, blush at me and ask 'sir can i take a picture with you?' I start to wonder what beauty even is if a cis girl feels beautiful only in these short moments when she goofs around for a few hours dressed as a guy. If you want to look more feminine, go for it. Seriously, no one should judge you it this is what makes you feel more comfortable. It's the least we can do, since I don't think any person truly loves the way they look. I'm about to start making some eyepatches for myself for every possible occasion. If I have to live with asymetrical ugly face, with fucked up eyes, I'll at least have kick ass eyepatches to make me feel better about myself.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a cis woman who doesn't wear makeup (usually), if I'm honest with myself, I do it because I don't want to get to the point of not liking my face without it. I don't want that to happen. Besides, I also find the process annoying and not really rewarding. It's a bit like when I've dyed my hair in the past: first, it seems cool, but I get used to it quickly and then it's just annoying to maintain.  Also, I find it empowering to not conform to the expectation that I don't like.  But it really has little to do with trying to appear more masculine or belittling other women. They can do what they feel to be empowering. Though I can't deny that I have doubts about all (cis) women choosing 'freely' to wear makeup. Obviously, societal expectations play a role. They also do in my decision.  I also understand how especially people who aren't usually expected to wear makeup (prime example being men) can find it empowering to do so.  To me, makeup is sort of a double-edged sword. I don't want to support an industry that IMO kind of relies on the insecurity of women, yet I understand that it can feel empowering and I especially like that it can be used to express individuality. I just don't like the implication that cis women who don't wear makeup are trying to appear masculine (even though that is not necessarily a bad thing) or trying to belittle other women. For me, I don't feel like that's the case.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a woman currently involved in academia I have found that not wearing makeup has less to do with it being a power move or not-like-other-girls complex and more to do with being taken seriously.  I've found that if I am wearing obvious make-up (usually not-nude lipstick or eyeliner) professors are less likely to call on me when I have a question (or an answer to one of their questions) and when they do call on me they give very short answers ('don't worry about it', etc) yet with a male student (or female student not obviously wearing makeup) they'll call on them almost immediately and then spend the next 10 minutes giving an in depth answer even if it involves something outside of the realms of the class.  Obviously this does vary a little from professor to professor but it has happened to me enough (and I've heard plenty of similar accounts from other female students) that I just can't be bothered (especially if I know that I have a hard class that day so therefore need my questions taken seriously).

"I feel I only can judge if people any gender whether I find them more or less aesthetically pleasing and also whether they're what would be considered conventionally attractive (like symmetry, close to average features etc.) if I don't know them well or at all. But I cannot tell if I find them sexually attractive or not (whatever that really means). But once I actually know people well or at least have 'parasocial relationship' with them (i.e. have watched them long enough on youtube/films etc that my brain is fooled into thinking it really know them); I no longer can judge how aesthetically pleasing they are. Once I know them, my perception of their personality, i.e. how much I like them outweighs their appearance almost completely. And only then can I some times feel something that might be called sexual attraction to them.    (Is this what being demisexual feels like? Or am I gray-sexual maybe? I am somewhat sexual though cause I am married to a woman I do feel sexual attraction to. But I don't feel that very often at all to others and never towards people I don't know).   I still can of course tell that someone is conventionally attractive or not to some extent; because I can still visually judge things like symmetry and proportions, but I cannot judge how attractive that is to me in isolation because my opinion of their personality colors my perception so much more. And for some reason I usually cannot remember what I really felt about them before I knew them. And since I'm also pansexual I do find both quite feminine and quite masculine and everything in between; perhaps I like androgyny slightly more than the extreme ends; I find it really hard to accurately judge if a transperson is 'passing' or not; since it really don't matter to me.  And since you most definitely are in the parasocial relationship category; I honestly cannot tell objectively how attractive you are to me by looks alone; and even if I'd remembered what I thought the first time I saw you it doesn't really help since you've changed your appearance since then.  All I can say is that to me you're attractive because I really enjoy your humor and personality (as far as I really can tell from your videos); and your face is nice and symmetrical and you dress really nice, but to what extent that is a heteronormatively feminine beauty or not I honestly cant tell at all.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

If you need surgery for your thoughts, there are other options to work on that ;) Send you lots of appreciation, for both for  your looks and the parts of inner-you you share as an artist with your audience <3  Ah and yes that 'shirt' (excuse me) seems to be the most divine top my eyes have ever encountered, GORGEOUS <3 Suits you just perfect :)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"White cis-woman here  I feel uncomfortable seeing cosmetic surgery/other treatments promoted to women across the popular internet. I want to tell women that they can accept themselves as they are. This year, I have not shaved my legs and armpits. I feel comfortable & liberated in my body, but it is still embarrassing to expose that part of myself in public, especially with activities like swimming (where I am confronted with stares from the elderly lap swimmers at the gym). I don't know how long I can keep it up, and may eventually cave to society's beauty standards. I still pluck the thick, dark hairs from my upper lip, chin, and eyebrows, out of a need to fit in. Thanks for making this honest video. I think I shall try more to develop my own style, which may only be a slight shift in the beauty norm.

"In my opinion, in order to ruin opressing beauty standards its not enough to just stop looking beautiful in terms of standards. First of all, having an opportunity not to care about aperierience is a privilege itself. Second of all, in case if alt rights totally apropriate a concept of beauty, which they are constantly trying to do, the society is f****d, because beauty makes better populism, unfortunately. I think the best strategical move for us, women, is to constantly mix doing beauty practices with not doing them, constantly adding a little amount of ignoring beauty standards and by that I mean having some days of not wearing makeup, or wearing as little as possible, not shaving etc, but also I mean having famous women who do (god save Contra) and other famous women who never do, therefore normalize both doing and not doing some beauty practices. When the slow smooth process of step by step normalizing is complete, beauty practices may vanish as too hard and unnecessary in first place. People appear to be lazy and that what was always pushing the progress.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a female academic, I gotta say I love the minimal makeup standard. I love having a job where I will probably never be required to wear heels (though I still do for special occasions). However...I also like that there is enough of a critical mass of women in my field that I can wear a top with lace on it or try out some sweet new game of thrones hairstyle without anyone batting an eye, and I love that I now have colleagues I can point to who DO go with the full on girlie look AND still get respect.   So I guess my ideal would be for women to feel like they can enjoy the creative and feminine side of makeup and clothing as they see fit without the insecurities or the pressure to conform...but that is difficult, because those things are a way of signalling group identity, and we are social creatures who usually need to fit in with some group - even if that group is 'the misfits who reject the standards of the larger group'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I see the production value has been turned up a notch.  On the topic:  I'm a cis, femmy, sexually-struggling, shy little thing; but I wonder if my experiences may influence you to play with some ideas. My mother was a model. She'd pressure her children to look pretty, to not be fat, to show a little leg, that kind of thing. Now, when I was young I was going through a lot of mental illness due to an abusive and neglectful household. So, my response to this kind of prettifying, looks-before-well-being mentality was pure rebellion. I messed up my hair, wore ill-fitting pants, no bra, baggy shirts - being very contently ugly. I knew what was important. God damn them for thinking my well-being comes second.  Since that uncomfortable teenage time, I have really enjoyed being ugly. Ugly means you don't put any work in. Ugly means you're not living up to your status. Being willfully ugly means there's something you think of as more important. I try to spread this kernel of positive ugliness around - that bit of freedom I experienced - so that women can be happier with multiple aspects of themselves. I hope that I bring it to you as well.  What do I feel like when I wear makeup? Like a clown. It seems overly theatrical, which is fun, but it's clearly a mask. When do I feel beautiful? I love to dream. When I wake up with a cloudy complexion, all puffy and soft with messy hair, I feel beautiful. However, this has recently challenged my point of view: URL That makeup can be a candle in the darkness makes me want to figure out how I might represent that candle.  'Why the fuck are you telling me all of this?' Oops! I guess I was hoping to give you a different perspective to play with and it didn't work. My bad.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've been thinking about beauty and self image for a good while. As a teenager I was a bit pimply (not too bad anyway) but I became so insecure over it that I kept popping and scratching at my pimples until my face was covered in scabs. So obviously this made me feel like shit. Add on top of that not being fit (having a bit of a tummy, not too much) and yeah, you just keep looking at yourself in the mirror trying to find the 1 second and angle where you think you look OK.   I eventually became super into working out and after 5 years I've realized I'm super happy for the first time with my body because it feels strong. I was born female but was always super masculine about a lot of things; I do have an ass but no tits and my shoulders look a bit masculine so I've always felt like shit over not being 'feminine enough'. But training really helped me listen to my body more and concentrate on finding the shape that fits me best, which is a place in between. Make up wise I beat myself up really badly over how I needed to put on concealer/setting powder before letting others see me, otherwise I'd hide behind my hair feeling like a monster; this has slowly changed over time, although it's still something I struggle with.  Great video btw. I have to say that I was a bit taken aback when I saw your face because trans women going for hyper feminine behaviour or looks always makes me feel a bit shit (because I was born female but could never comply or perform the same hyper feminization, I feel like it's imposed to me... when trans women do it I feel like it's a slap in the face - not that this is okay, and it's honestly just a case of my own feelings, I would never expect any other person to change their behaviour or give a flying fuck about me feeling salty over shit that really is my own problem). But I really liked the discussion. It gave me a whole new way of looking at how trans identities interact with gender roles.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Love your vids as always, but one thing amazes me: why is it so inconceivable that there are women who present as kinda androgynous because that's their *version* of looking like a woman?  That's just what feels natural to them because we all have slightly different preferences regarding our gender style.  We all know straight cis women who are kinda androgynous, same with cis men.  I dunno, I grew up in the 80's when fashion was way more gender-bendy than it is now, so maybe it's just harder for me to see what all the fuss is about.  My point is that it isn't necessarily succumbing to pressure to 'not care' about being beautiful.  Fact is some of us sincerely have a more relaxed attitude towards physical appearance.  Especially if you're lazy like me  - I find it much easier to relate to just going casual, comfortable and low-maintenance because being a princess is too much damn work.  OF COURSE being trans means all the stuff I mentioned would have different connotations, this is just my perspective as a cis woman.  I suppose looking girly means something different when I can take my femininity for granted.  I've never had to prove it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"For me, being asexual; makeup has always been about treating my body as a canvas. I spent a year in a residential psych unit, and it was mostly female dominated. We got very creative and flamboyant with our makeup  and hair, and it was mostly a bonding experience with each other rather than intended for any of the guys- who often complained about it. I often do more makeup when I'm going out with female friends, than I ever did dating my husband. Grooming behaviors are very much a bonding experience for women, if you removed men completely, I daresay women would get very extreme in their makeup and dress.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Natalie, here's what I see when I look at you. (Not that it really matters, but I'm a cis, white girl who hasn't really figured out sexual attraction yet largely due to oodles of anxiety and libido-killing meds to treat it starting in my teens. I finally have a degree so I'm trying to take some time to figure myself out. You help with that more than you might think btw)  I think your objectively pretty. You've had some air of femininity for a long while now, but it seems to get more refined and natural in each new video. I think your voice may be the biggest 'tell,' but that's come a long way, too.  I know you have image issues, but you honestly come across really confident and comfortable with who you are, and that's more attractive than anything.   I dance (lindy hop and some blues), though I should specify that I'm not a *dancer* (I definitely don't exude grace out of every pore). I've spent a lot of time watching people and trying to learn from them. There are some incredibly beautiful people that dance. The thing is, it's not the ones that have the prettiest faces and perfect bodies that draw me in. It's the people who's movements seem so perfectly easy, and especially those who just seem to love what they're doing. There is so much beauty in comfort and owning everything that you are. YOU, Natalie, are funny and smart as hell. You're charismatic and charming and genuine, and whether or not you feel like it, you seem so unapologetically *you* in a way that I think is really attractive and I can't quite achieve yet. I admire you a lot. In some ways, I really strive to be more like you. Not because you're perfect, but because you're a vibrant, interesting person with some sort of allure that's both comforting and intriguing. This might sound like flattering bullshit, but I've been as honest as possible and I hope that comes across. You make me feel better about my imperfections and help me improve how I approach myself and others, so thank you. You rock, no matter what!!!!!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Omg I have no idea what she was talking about and I'm glad! I never considered myself to be pretty but I don't validate myself (or anyone) based on beuty. On the other hand,  I understand how others respond to standards of beauty so usually I purpusely 'perfom femme beauty' (you know, staying fit, wearing the right clothes and make up, etc)  just so I can benefit from others insecurities. I know that's kind of mean but I tried to make other people aware of the fact that conditioning their self-worth on  unexistent standards is delusional and it just didn't work.

If you are going to make it a mental competition, make it a FAIR competition.

"My brother underwent rhinoplasty at about the same time you had your FFS. He seems to be satisfied, but I perceive some of what you mentioned: that people who get plastic surgery expect the procedure to completely fix the mental image, and there is a melancholy that settles when they realize that's not the case. During the same time, I got my first tattoo, with which I am extremely happy. I see how it aligns with what you say at the end of the video, as tattoos are a choice of style rather that a step towards beauty standard compliance. I don't want to imply that the only valid body modifications are tattoos, piercings and similar stuff; after all, the melancholy of my brother is minimal compared to the boost of confidence that he got thanks to the rhinoplasty. It is more of an observation that supports your case, I guess. Good job as always, Natalie, and thanks for persevering!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

And, a woman also has every right to do absolutely nothing.   She has the right to wake up in the morning, take a piss, and say, 'Ha! Look at that. Apparently, I was born with a man's body. And I have a beard. Nobody on earth will know I'm actually 100% female (aside from this rather impressive penis I was born with) until I tell them. (And even then a few of them won't believe me.)'  EITHER option is right/correct/valid/honest/legitimate/fantastic/unimpeachable because America is a free country and we champion being who you are, being authentic, and doing whatever the fuck you WANNA do.   Being Lady Diana, being Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson, being anything in between, the full spectrum   are all the right option to pick for any woman. Any woman. Any woman.   Any woman.

"What does it mean to experience beauty? Do you look at someone, and experience them as beautiful only after considering whether they conform to social norms, or is it a more visceral reaction? Aren't there different kinds of experiences of visual beauty, e.g. -looking at a sexually attractive person, -looking at a person with striking symmetry, skin tone and bone structure (or, as you pointed out: style) that you appreciate as beautiful but aren't sexually attracted to, -looking at, for example, a person with down's syndrome beaming with delight and appreciating the beauty of their expression of genuine, pure enjoyment of life. etc. Doesn't it make sense to differentiate between these types of Beauty when talking about 'Beauty Standards'?  Is it reasonable to say that every time a woman experiences another woman as beautiful, she does not find her beautiful of her own accord, but is merely socially conditioned into experiencing her as beautiful? And what's with all the comments saying 'omg, u'r so beautiful, don't even say u'r not!' by women, for women? Are you saying their appreciation for aesthetics as a major source of self-worth (as is implied by people who choose to focus on your looks when flattering/consoling/approving of you), is all brainwashing? If the appreciation of beauty is merely a product of social conditioning, what is that appreciation conditioned with (i.e. how can Pavlov condition his dog to salivate at the sound of a bell, without the existence of an intrinsic 'appreciation' for the food that is being associated with the bell)?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'Beauty standards are arbitrary, social constructs created by the cis white male patriarchy'  'Beauty standards are rooted in markers of evolutionary fitness, i.e. can't be changed'  Any world view that believes one of these statements exclusively, is incomplete. Beauty IS rooted in evolutionary fitness, but complex social structures DO influence what we pay attention to and value. Without accepting some things for what they are we can't grow individually, and without seeking to change some social norms we can't grow as a society. A more productive conversation deals with the details of what should be accepted (and why) and what should/can be changed (and why).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Found out I'm a trendsetter: I've had 'facial masculinisation surgery' before term 'incel' was even invented. This because despite being my orthodontist's pet project (he told so myself), he couldn't get my teeth straight due to my massive overbite. So I had my lower jaw lengthened.  I had a head like a basketball for weeks afterwards this relative minor surgery, so I can't imagine how huge Nathalie's head must have been. Especially the part where the bruising (and therefore my face) started turning sickly yellow was flattering.  Oh, and kudos on probably the best American attempt at pronouncing 'Van Gogh' I've ever heard.

"Holy crap! I was so worried this was actually going to be a make-up tutorial XD I'm so glad that instead it's another very honest and insightful chapter of your book :) I really enjoy it a lot to hear you talk about your thoughts and experiences. I so often wonder about how people see their gender and how much they care and try to look 'the part' so to speak; we all at least try to project an image of the person that is our neurons and some other stuff -- you know the stuff emergent from that, like personality and things. Your point of view gives me plenty of food for thought.   On a side note, you look amazing! I love how the colour of your eyeshadow brings out the colours of your eyes. You have great taste. You are an artist and it shows. I also adore the top! :D I'd be super proud if I ever got the chance to walk into a way too expensive restaurant wearing a tux with your hand on my arm with you looking like that. I admit that I would just love the reason to wear a tux and look amazing myself :p And show it off to you because I know you appreciate beauty.   On a side note of a side note, Your sense of humour always reminds me of my best friend who lives way too far away and I see her far too little. She also has an appreciation of absurdism and she's also very open and honest about herself and like you, she won't shy away from self-mockery to put things in perspective and lighten the mood a little. I can see why not everyone would appreciate that but I love it! The human mind intrigues me maybe even more than physics does and the most fun people are those who can catch you of guard with a great question or surprise you by (re)acting completely different from what you'd expect and give perspectives you wouldn't come up with, and of course make you laugh and feel safe, but that should speak for itself I think.

"Some insecurity is perfectly normal, in a human. We need to stop this bullshit, holier-than-thou competition for which leftist feminist can be the most secure in themselves that they can reject all things superficial and potentially tainted by the patriarchy. Of course it's tainted by the patriarchy; a lot of humanity's developments have taken place within the context of patriarchal societies. There's just no untangling that shit entirely, right now. That has to take place over a longer period of time. Like fuuuuuck... can we just breathe and accept that perfect wokeness and being a perfect feminist isn't possible?

"I think the last remark in the video 'I guess I'll just have to cultivate intelligence, kindness, and inner beauty - eww' really gets at the heart of the matter. People know beauty standards are oppressive and limiting, but they are still emotionally entrapped by the messages associated with rejecting those standards. Rejecting them feels like something that only gross, ugly people do out of necessity. The reality is that while there may be some correlation there, it's the 'beautiful people' that are missing out on deeper, freer, and more fulfilling relationships in life.    I say that as someone who still wants to be and be with the 'beautiful people' but wish I could reprogram myself to feel differently about beauty and physical attraction. I actually do think it's possible, it's just extremely difficult and takes a long time. I don't think the answer is to just throw your hands in the air and decide 'well, I care about this stuff and I can't help that.' One can be compassionate towards oneself having and/or acting on that impulse (guilt is pointless here) without abandoning a commitment to becoming less shallow over time.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The point you mention at the end about creating a unique style is very important in exalting the desire to be beautiful from something mundane to something quite sublime. This is true, as it recontextualizes beauty as something that's very individual and unique to the individual as opposed to something that's inherently competitive like attractiveness. When I was a teenager, I very quickly got overwhelmed with playing the beauty game and I became a rebel with my own style and no one dressed like me. So, instead of trying to reach for something unattainable, I made myself very strange and beautiful in my strangeness. And I think my teen years were a lot smoother because I could treat that situation with a sense of detachment, even if there was a lot of denial going on at the same time.   But even though I didn't completely transcend the influence of the beauty standards of the society, there was something elevating about it.  And there was so much more empowerment to be had in the strange personality-laden beauty that I had created that made people see me more as a mystery, an artist, an oddity, a rebel, and ultimately an individual whether they liked it or hated it.    So, I'm now 30 years old, and in my early 20s I went through a process of 'vanillification' to blend into society as an adult working a 9 to 5, which brought me back down into the fray you find yourself in of comparison and competition and fighting the losing battle of time and significance that women face in a uniquely threatening way. And that forced me to stand face to face with the pervasive shadow of feminine beauty standards and my desire to fit them and all the pain and insecurity that comes with it.    But I am now finding my way back to the kind of austere beauty as my youth leaves me while also honoring my desire to be conventionally beautiful. And I really resonate with the archetype of the witch, as this is an empowering archetype to own at every age. It also helps that I'm a Youtuber as well, as I am my own boss. So, I can be as I am without having to cleave to the conventions of society as much. So, I feel a lot freer to color outside the lines in many ways. But I know that that monster still lurks in the darkness somewhere, and I'll have to face it more and more every day. Hopefully, I can learn to love and embrace that monster. But it's hard because it's nothing less than the fear of death and insignificance, that simply expresses itself through beauty and the ancestral memory of objectification that effects everyone in society.    Godspeed. This one is difficult to transcend. You have to let the proverbial hag devour you, and that's hard to do.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"@Contrapoints You mentioned that you've never cared about your appearance and being beautiful. But I think that at least some part of you knows you are beautiful (unlike before) and that's why your expectations have risen. Because you now compare yourself to people you consider more beautiful than those you used to compare yourself to (because you are now a woman and comparing yourself to women on one hand and also because your own perception of yourself has improved). But improved perception of oneself, it seems to me, is actually not mutually exclusive with having your self-confidence shrink, because that change actually also entails a change in the scale of things, and thus is relative to it.

"Well if you want an honest assessment (which you prob don't from a ogre like myself) I preferred your looks as a man, can tell there's maybe something up, but wouldn't out you as trans right away. The makeup and overall effort you put into the look means you do look better than most people on the street going to work or whatever.

"your 'bad skin day,' is better than my good day lol. i truly wish you could see how cute you are.  i highly doubt i can help you with your self image issues, but one thing that helped with me, personally, was not focusing on each individual 'flaw', and realizing those are negligible compared to how you look overall.   i also realized that outside media influenced my standards more than i thought, and that it didn't actually make you really gross just to have cellulite on your legs or some acne. i also began to notice women with wrinkled skin and greying hair who were attractive. having a perfectionist perspective takes away from appreciating anything for what it is.   i guess the more, 'woke,' thing to say is screw it, stop caring about looks, but that would be useless imo.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Another thing I'd like to tack on is that people treat me way better with a full beat face. Everywhere. No matter what. Every time I go out it's with the generally same smile, style and attitude towards things (at least on the outside) I do my best to keep that mask on the front to protect myself,  you know? 'If you have a bad attitude you'll attract bad attitudes.' kind of thing. I still find that people are way more rude, mean-spirited and dismissive of me if I'm not wearing makeup. It doesn't happen literally every single time, of course, but more often than not I have bad run-ins with people when I'm not wearing my mask. I love doing makeup, it's literally my job, I just really hate that people treat me differently when I decide to look like a standard human, you know?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"This lesbian is straight chillin'... but she also knows what it's like to feel intense dislike for your own body. I'm fat, I have a strong jaw, my nose isn't perfectly straight, hell, I spent eons worrying about the fact that my fingers weren't long enough to look dainty and elegant. I worried that no man could ever love me, yada yada yada, and while I did eventually realize I had no interest in a man's opinion, before that I realized that the things I saw as fatal flaws in myself were things I would barely notice about another woman. Flabby arms? Soft, great for hugging. Same with chubby bellies, and I could wax poetic about thick thighs. So if it helps anyone else to try to turn it around - look at the women around you, then ask yourself if you'd noticed their 'flaws'. Then ask yourself if you're in the habit of assuming everyone else immediately notices and criticizes those same 'flaws' in you.   And if the answer is 'I notice and I care, and seeing a slightly (or substantially) different face in the mirror would make me happy because that face would more closely match how I see myself'. (Or 'My ability to look cis is integral to my safety, whether mental or physical'.) Then do what makes you feel at home in your own body.  Just consider your view might be tainted by society first.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"STAHP reminding us that our relationship with you is only parasocial :'(    Seriously, though. You're right that we do wear makeup for ourselves. I'm an asexual woman who has never been interested in even dating - but I like green/blue eyeliner. I'll even wear it when I'm at home by myself. It's pretty much routine by this point - I feel naked without those two little lines on my eyelids.    The 'original' reason I started wearing makeup at 16 was because I was sick of people thinking I was a school aged child...a frustration I still experience a good 10 years later. I just wanted to stop getting patronised and spoken down to because I 'look like a child'(plus I did NOT enjoy being asked asked 'WHY AREN'T YOU IN SCHOOL?' and having to reply 'I DON'T GO TO SCHOOL, MR RANDOM OLD MAN. I JUST GOT BACK FROM A 12 HOUR SHIFT, LET ME WALK HOME IN PEEEEAAAACE').    I didn't start wearing it because I felt ugly or sickly(though, when I look back at photos of myself in those pre-eyeliner days now - I do think it), and not because I ever got told I was ugly - I was pretty fortunate in that nobody called me that growing up. But...ultimately, you could say I still did it because I was tired of society judging me on my looks in other ways. And then I grew to enjoy the 'escape' away from being so patronised for my babyface(plus...I kind of can't stop wearing it now because I like making my green/blue eyes pop even more than they already do...it turns out. Yes, I like staring at my own eyes when I'm in the bathroom alone - call me shallow. It's fiine).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"ContraPoints is much more experienced in life than me, so I don't feel I should be giving any advice. Still, I feel like since most of her beauty problems derive from her inner feelings and not exterior (since plastic surgery didn't make her feel any better), maybe instead of changing her face, she should change her perspective of how she looks. I know that what I suggest isn't an easy task and that it doesn't change societal standards of what beauty is, but by redefining what beauty is to you as an individual, you can change how you see yourself. Simply by finding the features on your face that you do like about yourself, instead of focusing on what you don't like about yourself through apps like Facetune, and reminding yourself of them, you can start to like your face more and more.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Women now may not use make up with that specifically in mind, but that is the original purpose of the make up, it seems mostly now that women wear make up to compete with each other on looks or to avoid scrutiny from other women.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I actually have sort of a skin care routine now and I don't just throw on the first clothes that I can grab in the morning.

"I think part of the reason women who don't wear makeup and masculine fields are correlated is because fields where women are EXPECTED to wear makeup act unfriendly to women who don't. The fields where there weren't as many women to start with don't have that reaction, because makeup is serving as an intersexual social cue, not a general one; it's radical enough that the person doesn't have a wiener, doesn't matter if they have product on their face or not! Then, that builds up over time. There's definitely also an element of feminists pushing for more women in those fields at the same time as the anti-makeup rhetoric was getting really loud, and consequential passing down of that memo between generations of women in the field, but I don't think it's as strong a factor as you're initially noting.

"Something struck me when you said that you were going through adolescence again on camera. I remember in my mid-late teens being obsessed with beauty because it was new, exciting and felt like the refined, final pokemon evolution compared to my awkward-ass middle pokemon stage. But a decade later in my mid-late 20's, I'm not too concerned about encompassing beauty all the time because it's a facet of womanhood I've already explored. I'm invested in other things like...a mortgage, a good healthcare plan and wondering if marrying is worth the tax benefits. Lol. Transitioning now truly is second adolescence, and I'm thinking perhaps, with time, once you've thoroughly explored that part of womanhood, the insatiable need to be beautiful all the time will wane.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I definitely hear the point about everyone caring about beauty.  I'm a 35 year-old straight cis man who's been overweight his whole life, and I've got so much internalized hate for my appearance that decades ago I subconsciously decided the only way to deal with it was to adopt the mindset of Tyrion Lannister, 'wear it like armor.'  Basically, I decided since I was never going to be viewed as attractive, I just wasn't going to care.  It's only been in the last 10 years that I've actually started trying to take care of myself appearance-wise, and while I consciously know I'm not inherently unattractive, that internalized negative self-image just never goes away.  So when you talk about looking at yourself in the mirror and never seeing how pretty you are, I totally get it.  Cis/trans, man/women, binary/non, straight/gay, we all struggle with this shit.

"I'm nearing 3 years HRT. Despite passing (as strangers' reactions imply, at least) I feel FFS would improve everything immensely. But at the same time... I've seen ciswomen with stronger brow ridges than me. With more body hair. Anything that feels like a weak point. And somehow, with time, you can come to kind of just... own it. Objective masculinity is stripped away from it as a quality. Femininity stereotypes definitely erect steeper standards, but if you can start to see through them, it becomes a lot easier to meet and accept the way you are. And as you do, it's easier and easier to realize 'I'm a woman with these qualities,' rather than those qualities themselves.  Keep on, Natalie. ","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

On the other hand, I feel hatred towards my body and would love to cut the fat off with a butcher's knife and manually re-align my jaw. I'm not sure how much of it is societal pressure or reality. I know that I feel ashamed when my partner says I'm beautiful, because I love them so much and they deserve so much more.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I find it fascinating how even models and celebrities can struggle with insecurities about their looks. The modeling industry doesn't just give normal woman body image issues, but models themselves can develop issues. Cameron Russell called models 'the most physically insecure women probably on the planet.' Having your looks photo-shopped all the time doesn't feel great.   Also, praise from fans can have its own drawbacks. There's an episode of Justin Baldoni's Man Enough where they talk about body image issues and how positive reinforcement can become a pressure and create an expectation for them to constantly look good. Justin Baldoni himself gets plenty of compliments on his looks from fans, but even he considered getting cosmetic surgery.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Sweetie, I am here to tell you that the day will come when you look in the mirror and think, 'Damn, I am gorgeous,' and it will not be a fleeting thing. What is the secret of my geriatric beauty? Is it the acceptance and wisdom that comes with age? No. It is macular degeneration! I look fabulous all the time now. My skin is flawless and, honestly, I look as good as I did at 30.

"Just want to throw out there that I find it interesting how similar and different FTM experiences are from MTF. (I am FTM, pre-T & pre-Operative, and currently contemplating both). It is so different starting at the experience of being raised as a woman than it is going into the experience of becoming a woman...the way that Patriarchy and internalized inferiority functions both so similarly and differently. I dealt with a lot of what you are going through when I was going through first puberty when I was a teenager. Anyway...it's strange that the various operations that FTM people get are not, in my experience, seen as vain, whereas the equivalent surgeries for MTFs are seen as vain. It's so strange because it almost demonstrates how the Patriarchy functions on stereotype and appearance. Despite being 'biologically female' as an FTM person, I am not seen as vain for getting surgeries done that will make me feel more beautiful/whole/me. Whereas the opposite functions in a way that frames these surgeries as vain / excessive to a degree / fixated on beauty. I'll be thinking more about this!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Fantastic video but there's one bit that bugs the hell out of me: the constant 'people are liars/deluded by parasocial bonds/etc' joke to invalidate positive feedback. Like, I'm not saying parasocial relationships are weird or that fans' feedback should be taken as gospel, but the implication that any positive comment is dubious seems to me like more a projection of your own insecurities than anything else. I mean, you go from 'every other trans women on youtube is a goddess' to that statement, and like...are *you* lying when you say that? I mean, it's a hyperbole, but when you compliment another trans woman in particular, are you generally being honest or not? And if you are, why assume you're the only one who is? Maybe the issue is you've spent too long on forums like 4chan where sincerity is basically taboo, in very much the same way as the black-pilled incels who, in your video about them, you described as rejecting anyone who makes positive responses to someone's post. Then again maybe I'm just psychoanalyzing a complete stranger and this whole comment is parasocial bullshit. I don't know. Just seemed like something worth thinking about.

"The part about men liking more 'natural' makeup is sooooo true. Not only that, I've expierenced it from A LOT of people around me. I like to have days of over the top makeup and then of a more natural one. I keep hearing my familly, some friends, some of my mum's friends etc say that I should stick to the natural one, 'cause I'm a 'pretty girl'. Honestly, it's just sad, also because that kinda implies that makeup takes that away from me. I wanna get colourful hair - that's childish. I wanna get piercings - ew, just don't. I'm blessed by also having friends and a wonderful boyfriend that incourage me to be who I wanna be, to look how I wanna look.   I was always told from strangers and familly that I was a 'pretty girl', though I never really believed it. That might be, because I have a lot of alergy-related scars and open spots till now, but it started when I was a child, so some kids were afraid of me, which always made me feel bad about myself. Also, even if people from my familly were calling me such a pretty child, a lot of them were terrified of the state of my skin (including for example my mum). I was also told a lot by my dad that I was fat, because of having no muscle-structure. I was never into sports and I'm just too lazy to be, even though that is haunting me 'till this day. So a lot of my life was feeling like trash about my skin, my weight (I was never really overweight, exept for a passage of time when I was about 10kg havier than I am now and I hated how I looked and felt), I didn't like my face... even the things everyone around me complimented didn't seem that great. The way I felt about my body goes beyond that, too. I was insecure about EVERYTHING I did. My state of mind this year was so bad, I couldn't stand it. I had such an identity crisis and one night I cut my hair short with scissors that are supposed to be usued to cut nails. Through everything though, I finally had the courage to dress how I wanted, do my makeup as I wanted, as I just didn't care. Almost everything that happened to me in this time was just awful.

I'm seeing it as me trying to physically and aesthetically the person I've always wanted to be.  In high school I thought lolita was beautiful but could never wear it. I know now that at that time there was actually a lot of lolita i could fit into and it hurts now that I'm too fat to fit into these gorgeous clothes But the changes I made now make me so much happier, and I hope this happiness helps me love myself more and take better care of myself.  Thank you for this video. It really vocalizes little things that have been bubbling in my head.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"vanities vanitatum indeed!  the characteristics of external male and female beauty derive from deep-rooted biological indicators of reproductive health, with an overlay of cultural preference... and then there are the fashion-dependent antics of prettifying (think powdered wigs and whitened faces of the Baroque; the blackened teeth of the court ladies in the Japanese Heian period; facial hair gardening for men, and so on)  body beauty is fleeting, fashion is fickle... beautiful minds and generous hearts are forever... just try to maintain a healthy body and transfix those around you with what is inside you, you are doing great as you are!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"If your academic classmates are like me, I wonder if it's just another response to the beauty pressure: giving up.   Sure, there are times when I make and effort and feel pretty (well, more along the path to pretty in any case), but that only makes the self loathing worse later. I've even made an effort not to hide some of my faults because coming to terms with them seemed like it might work better (hardly). And in the end, no metter what I do I'll never be able to come close to those who have practised for years to look perfect. I look like a pig in make up. And even if I did become an expert it would all be for nothing, because the experts hate themelves too! We all play to lose.

"This only further proves my opinion that BDD needs to be given more attention amongst psychologists. For those who don't know BDD stands for Body Dysmorphic Disorder. It is a mental disorder that affects about 2% of the population, is very similar to OCD and is characterized by an obsession with a delusional or non-delusional flaw or flaws. Symptoms incude a general feeling of being unattractive or ugly, a fear of rejection based on your flaws and spending hours obsessively trying to fix your flaw or neglecting that part of your body altogether. BDD has the highest rates of suicidal ideation and attempt rates out of all mental disorders with 57% and 22% of patients respectively. Another danger with this illness is that plastic surgery doesn't help and can either make you more obsessed and unsatisfied with the result or make your BDD move on to another body part. According to a questionnaire amongst plastic surgeons 1 in 5 people who seek out cosmetic surgery have BDD. Now, finally, plastic surgeons are considering a mendatory screening for BDD before taking on a client. Please, if you're reading this and think you may have BDD, seek out help! I was diagnosed last year and the past year my BDD severity has dropped immensely. It gets better.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

So if you want to hear that, I will of course say it more often, because it is true. And that you are intelligent and funny and talented makes you even more attractive.  It is hard to come to love oneself and find beauty in oneself and at least accept your own body, for me as a cis woman, but I imagine, when you are transitioning it is even harder.

"Natalie, thank's for engaging with this complex topic in such a detailed manner. It's complicated. I would say you noticeably made your nose more conventionally attractive. But I don't think it was ugly before and aren't there lots of women who don't have conventionally mega attractive noses? As you say, it seems like a relevant part of your obsession with how you look goes beyond gender dysphoria.  I usually tell people that cosmetic surgery is just super expensive and feeds into an unhealthy mindset. But I can also kinda understand it, because I've been too fat my whole life and as a kid I had my gyno-tits removed which were a source of intense discomfort (maybe not unlike gender dysphoria?) and the doctors convinced me that there was nothing else I could do about them. Though it seems like that was not true and I could have tried to sweat the breasts away with years of intense workout regimen. Now, obviously that does not apply to bone structure, which can only be 'feminized' by surgery. But in the same way that I wonder if I shouldn't just stop waging the decades long war against being overweight and learn to accept myself as I am, I also wonder if a trans-woman accepting herself as she is wouldn't be more effective than surgery in the long run. You yourself said that you may never find yourself beautiful enough, which does sound a bit like the mindset of an addict. It sounds like you should get out of it.

I understand that there's a lot of humor interwoven into this and at the same time I'm thinking to myself: in the case of Youtube channels that have individuals with certain philosophical/political views(that have a big crowd of fans that support the content creator financially). What happens the day when the individual/content creator change their opinion or want to do something or be something else in life?

"I agree that it's tough to tell how pretty you are when people have this idea that calling someone anything under a 9 is insulting. Thanks, patriarchy lmao. I think you hit the nail on the head when you said that beauty is a collective aesthetic, and the rating scale is a measure of those standards, not how desirable/likable/attractive/moral/etc. you are.  In terms of how desirable/likable/attractive you are, yes absolutely, indisputably, you are a 10. You're amazing and I want to be around you all the time. I love staring at your face. But that's not the same thing as how well you fit conventional beauty standards. For that, I agree with your flippant assessment, which is that you're 60-70% conventionally beautiful, with wiggle room depending on personal preference (Ask two cis dudes to rate which Hollywood actresses are the most beautiful. There's wiggle room.).  Since you talk a lot about your personal complexes surrounding beauty, I'm curious why you didn't get more 'conventional' work done since you were going under the knife anyway.

"I think there's a whole interesting conversation about lesbians (but namely the more masculine ones) rejecting the idea of lots of beauty standards  Because there's often this IMMENSE feeling of a relief when a lesbian realizes they don't have to marry a man, and that can come with 'oh hey hell yeah actually fuck shaving i dont care anymore' And one of the more shallow reads on this is 'oh, rejecting heterosexual beauty standards because you're not available to men'  But in my experience this may align more with the kind of self-understanding that comes with that revalation that you don't have to put on as much of a show  because lots of other lesbians are also taking that breath of fresh air and know the kind of vulnerability that it takes to get there This is not all across the board of course, I'm more aesthetically in the 'ruffled scientist in a cartoon' nb-masculine camp myself with my round glasses and stick-up hair Lipstick lesbians are out there though and they're honestly supporting the backbone of our society I had a girlfriend who looked like a sanrio pixie with a kpop haircut every day and that kind of thing heals your soul tbh (but also she wore makeup for herself, and it added that other interesting dimension of being around when she wasn't so polished) But styles more on the masculine end definitely exist and are fascinatingly varied there are definitely lesbians who will put A LOT of energy into being beautiful in nontraditional ways.

"Natalie, I'm a liberally educated post-woke intellectual like you. I've been reading a mediocre book recommended by a woman who I'm romantically interested in for reasons other than her literary taste, and I've been dishonestly flattering her about the book rec. Why do I flatter her, lie that I'm enjoying the book when I could just as easily make it a project to destroy and reconstruct her literary taste? Flattery is a way to express attraction and admiration by ensuring that the flattered's necessary failure within a refined critical apparatus doesn't exclude them from attraction and admiration. I think about your fans telling you that you're flawless, so patently false that it has to be flattery. Your reaction reminds me of a George Lazenby blog post about liberal education    'Do you care about the whirl of experience more than you care about the comfort and leisure that would make that sort of life a pleasure? Because if you do liberal arts right, you'll become a roulette ball that never settles. For the rest of your life no identity will seduce, no doctrine will persuade, and no accomplishment will reward. You will not win because the momentum of intellectual greed bends everything into a circuit.  If Faust and Paradise Lost don't read as cautionary tales to you; if you're okay with seeming like a loser to everyone around you and--inwardly--even to your deepest self, then do it.'   It must needs be remarked that you should just read Plato again and live for death.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I have a strange relationship with performative femininity. My mother was THRILLED to have a daughter but ended up with a genderqueer kid who did not give a flying fuck about makeup and dresses. She tried to encourage me into makeup and the like and I just hated it, still hate it. I hate how it feels on my skin, I hate that I can't touch my face out of fear of smudging everything into ruin. I'd say I'm usually 60% masculine and 40% feminine but if I try to push more femininity I feel... fake... artificial... I hate it. To me, it's putting on a costume and pretending to be something I'm not.   I've been struggling to come to term with my 'transness', I don't consider myself a woman, or a man, I just don't want to engage in the social norms of either. Yeah, I wear a bra, because I have big tits. Yeah, I tend to wear clothes from the woman's section but that's because I have giant child bearing hips and a snatched waist, I'd have to tailor anything coming out of the men's section to fit big boobs and hips. I'm also autistic and can't handle harsh fabrics and men's clothes are often made out of sandpaper and cardboard.   Even with all that I still feel the pressures of beauty and adhering to a standard. People view me as a woman so they expect me to do traditionally feminine things. I've always gotten weird looks how I present myself. It would be easier on me if I wasn't like this but... then I wouldn't be me I'd be someone else.   I do respect the HECK out of anyone who can put on makeup. It's practically an esoteric ritual I can't understand so y'all are doing magic.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Darling, you're looking at the reason for our societal preoccupation with beauty all wrong. Beauty is a symptom, as is ugliness, as is aging. We're all capable and able to be beautiful; and the reason why we're obsessed with certain beauty standards is because they are indications of health. By understanding the issues we have with our bodies as symptoms of our internal health; then we're all capable of attaining perfect health; and through this: longevity.  I'm ranting, but here are some examples: Upper arm fat is a disturbance in our endocrine system (the one that uses adipose as a means of inter-glandular communication and storage) caused by a thyroidal imbalance: eat some iodine (best sources being seaweed like kombu, wakame, and dulse).  Dry skin can be caused by a vitamin A deficiency.  a lack of/ or depletion of ones' magnesium (and some other minerals) shows up in our dental-health.   Seriously, try googling whatever symptom you dislike with 'hormonal cause' or 'vitamin deficiency'; and you'll find a rationalized, un-co-modified answer to your completely subliminally valid insecurity.       Sometimes I think the free market is just confused, not evil. Anyway, you should read up on some estrogen/ progesterone boosting foods (like coffee and parsley). Oh, and collarbones are, like, one of the hottest body-parts; don't even.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is my new favorite video of your's, so raw and real; yet, it made me smile and laugh at points.  As a non-binary for whom wearing make-up causes dysphoria I wholeheartedly applaud your dedication. It's really quite inspiring to see the effort you go to. I may not personally understand it, but I recognise the empowerment you can get from it.  The bluntness and honesty you put into your work is one of the most appealing things for me and so let me say in pure bluntness and honesty you look great. I thought you looked particularly fem when the vid started and couldn't quite figure out why. Imo you more than pass, your dedication to the art of fem aesthetics pushes that ever higher.  You're an inspiration academically and visually. A part of me wishes I'd had half the love for the arts of face and hair you do, would have saved me a lot of abuse, but that said I do honestly admire you and all that you've done to find and live your truth.  Thank you for this and so many of your other videos, they always help me gain perspective, and are more deeply memorable than I really have the nuance to describe.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Finally a Natalie video where I have at least a fraction of the knowledge to contribute.  As a lifelong aesthete and purveyor of glamour, I feel it's my duty to invite you to our club. Do we feel guilty for the negative effects the fashion and beauty industry wreak on the world! Absolutely! I've been at this for 20+ years now so as an experienced superficial monstrosity, I recommend my model of slightly mindful but still deeply vain consumerism. I'm trying to buy more makeup from black owned beauty brands so I can at least enrich black women, since they're our real leaders in this social justice thing. With clothing and accessories, I'm attempting to buy from small independent Etsy sellers or thrifting, so I don't contribute to the fast fashion food chain. Etc etc. Can reccomend, definitely alleviates much of the guilt.   Frankly I would say if you're subscribing to arbitrary beauty culture such as wanting to be hairless and cellulite free, then you're just like your cisters. That's what we do, because we want to serve fashion and glamour to the girls and that's what our media glamorizes for us. Most cis girls of today are trying to fit an hourglass mold, in the oughts when all fashionable clothing was midriff baring, we were obsessed with flat stomachs. In the 90's we wanted heroin chic, in the 80's we wanted skinny athletic Australian with big titties etc etc. Welcome, come enjoy hopeless consumption culture with the rest of us!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Uh hey, Contra, hang in there. I really want this to be the depression talking - it does sound like the sort of thing depression says - but I also hope if you're feeling boxed in that you can find some freedom. It's hard with capitalism and all.  And also like. I want to say re: the actual topic of discussion that I think maybe it's just not helpful to talk about whether individual trans women should have ffs or do anything in particular to meet societal standards of feminine beauty but like, the responsibility has to be instead about system change. I know this is kind of just trite leftist one size fits all talking point stuff but I mean it. Like to me the argument that ffs is medically necessary leaves a lot of room to leave out the validity of other people's transition if they don't do it for whatever reason but I think it's also bad to attack someone (Natalie) for trying to feel good about themselves in a hostile world and like solidarity to make the world less hostile seems  like the only way to reconcile that yno?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Let's get the weird thing out. Not wearing makeup may appear to be more visually contrasting on the face, because of dark circles around the eyes and stuff. However, makeup actually makes the face more contrasting, depending on how you do it. This then brings in the point where studies have shown that higher contrast makes the same face more feminine and vice versa. However, due to 'natural' makeup there seem to be more of a gradient where the masculine is off center and gradients to feminine both ways. This brings up non facial points. For example, I as a nonbinary trans person, who has a hard time explaining the use of she/her without being a woman and it not generalizing to miss, madam, or the similar, find that my broad shoulders make me look alien in a dress. This is mainly due to that style of clothing not being designed to accommodate my body type. One massive way society could change would be for clothing to match by body type and style preferences.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I'm in that stage myself, I've been chronically ill and in ridiculous pain for so long I've just resigned myself to the fact that I'm not gonna be beautiful ever again, becoming blind and having to worry about money to pay for surgery to freaking be able to see anything is just about all I can take, and if anyone criticizes my appearance they'd better be ready for a fucking earful, too.

"I find the discussion on makeup very interesting because I had experienced very different growing up as a cis woman. I remember in middle school the day my mom took me to  Sephora and a lady there showed me how to put on makeup for every day and make up for special occasions. From that day on, I felt as if my face without make-up was unpresentable. I could not go outside without makeup. It was a necessity. By senior year of high school, I realized I had deeply internalized these feelings. I felt ugly without makeup. Whenever I went outside without makeup, I was deeply self-conscious. I had never really struggled with self-image like that before. For the first time, I really thought I was ugly. So I decided in college I wouldn't wear make-up. At first, I was super self-conscious, but eventually, I thought it insane to wear makeup everyday. I want to add that I never really liked makeup. I found putting it on to be a chore more than anything else. So I didn't wear makeup. I am going into my junior year of college, and I can happily say I find myself beautiful again without wearing makeup.  Now, I only wear makeup when I want to and not for some sense of necessity. I also don't consider makeup to be covering up my flaws but just enhancing my natural beauty.  This turned longer then I wanted it to, but I just think about if I would have a different understanding of makeup if I started wearing it when I was older and not eleven. Also, how vastly different ever individuals experiences with makeup. It was fascinating hearing Natalie talk about this and her feelings about it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I kinda feel the self affirming beauty rituals as a fat guy.

Then I'll spend a good amount of time sculpting my beard to the jawline because, again, can't lool like a lazy slob because being stylishly disheveled isn't an option for fat guys, but not having a beard emphasizes your double chin. I seek that rush of 'yeah, I look good' and love comments about my hair or clothes but have no idea what good looks like for me.

"As I boy who grew up with no athletic abilities, yes I can appreciate your starfish nights as I gazed up at the same starfishes growing up.  As a gay man, yes, I understand the ravishes of time, and how the oil of the paintings about which I critiqued, hold up better than my own skin.  Having completed the second half of my doctorate in mimetic research both occidental and oriental... Well, I read a lot of German and English literature, continental philosophy, and psychoanalysis... well, just those that came up on the syllabi, the most memorable/traumatic being Rilke, Spenser, Milton, Kant, Scarry, Marx, Jameson, Marcuse, Freud, Jung, Lacan, Zizek.  The constant tension between die ewige Ewigkeit and truth and justice and reform and beauty and the.. well, The.  It was a way to open avenues of understanding myself *AS A GAY MAN* I couldn't comprehend until years later.  The tension still remains between what is aesthetic and beautiful, what is aesthetic as emotional response, and what is beautiful for me... as a Ding an mich selbst. And I am a thing both to others and myself when I, like you, look into the mirror.  What is this thing?  (Fun note in Early Modern English the relative pronouns 'who' and 'what' were interchangeable).  I'd love to think that, because I am an intellectual, I am attractive, and to some sapiosexuals I am, but my analogous Gigi is the man with the huge Tom of Finland tattoo on his back on all fours at the Folsum Street Fair sucking dick at his master's command.  That speaks to a sexual aesthetic, which is always at tension to my cerebral notions of what is and must be accomplished for beauty to exist.  As a cis-gendered gay man the beauty of the well-built, hairless, aryan, sex god has ebbed to some extent, no doubt because the people who came of age in the 90's watching 'Bel-Ami Boys,' are no longer boys themselves.  I noticed on Pornhub a category for 'men in their thirties,' not daddies, but regular men, or porn stars, who of another generation would have been deemed passed their prime, who create content for those who grew up with them.  I think it's because there is some recognition within the gay porn community, to recognize that: 1.) their actors are growing older, 2.) the fans of those actors are also growing older, 3.) those who watched those actors want to know they are still virile and/or sexually desirable, and 4.) and audience now exist where middle-aged men will pay (just joking) watch men of their own age...the porn they grew up with now grown up itself.  This aesthetic is on foregrounded in capitalism, exploitation (the cornerstone of capitalism, I don't need to tell you); nevertheless it creates new categories for the left to critique.  But as a gay man in his late-late thirties, it gives me some reassurance that age and faggotry need not be mutually exclusive. And that is what Christopher Marlowe said before he was stabbed to death... by a cock in his eye.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Like yeah your nose sticked out a little and your chin was more prominent but it really didn't look bad, much less did it look manly, I actually think it looked cute, it had a spritely elvish quality to it..   Not that my faceless rando comment matters or anything, if this new look let's you love yourself more then that's all the reason you need, but for the record I think you've looked gorgeous for a long time.  Now back to pretending to be above such petty trivialities as the hotness of my para-social baby mommy. You are my sinful dark mother and are welcome to step on my neck whenst you please <3  (PS.

I inadvertently throw my voice and I mock myself through the subtle speech and behavior of others.  Its hard being so radiant and social only to piss out my own insecurities and have it reverb through all the faces I love the most. Your video I think made me realize this, for a while I think I just thought I was overbearing and suffocating, i mean thats true, but to an extent I think its me laying my self worth so heavily on others that the whimsy of my frontal lobe can cause such social havoc. Maybe its kinda like my telekinetic power...","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"_'I find that my desires to look female, to look feminine, and to look beautiful, are not exactly the same, but they're woven together so tightly, that its kind of difficult to untangle them'_ Unfortunate that you can't make those distinctions, you must be confused with what it means to be female. It is not makeup, dresses, being hot, and going to parties. There are masculine women too, and they are just as 'woman' as every other woman.  You are missing the female part of your conception of what it means to be a woman. Trans women are feminine, but they are not the same as an actual biological women. I can understand if you want to feel like a woman, you are going to go with common markers (stereotypes, mannerisms) that will signal that to society, and to yourself, since you have no internal frame of reference. But don't get it mixed with what its actually like to live life as a female. You did not have that experience. You were born male. _'Feeling mannish, or dysphoric, usually goes along with feeling ugly'_ That isn't true. _'I don't just want to look female, I want to be beautiful'_ So you want to claim womanhood but not the ugly parts of it.  _'Vindictive transsexualism'_ This, but unironically. This is going to sound cold af but you aren't a woman, you're a preening narcissist. That whole thing about 'women sucking dick to get makeup' - not noticing that it was male prison guards who were providing it. No matter how much surgery or hormones you get, you will always feel ugly, because you have low self esteem. I think you need professional help. You might have thought transitioning was the answer, but it clearly wasn't. You are only going to feel worse. You need to accept yourself the way you are.  'Beauty is a symbol of life, its defying death' You and everyone else around will die one day. It is juvenile to hold on to that fear for so long without coming to accept your mortality.  Beauty is partly rooted in biology. Not sure why you didn't go over the association with beauty (symmetrical facial features, usually) and health. We like to look healthy, because often that means we _are_ healthy. But there can be a point when you take it too far, into vanity and narcissism, which is rooted in self-hatred and fear. I agree with your comments on style.   You use a lot of the ironic gaslighting tactics that the alt-right do. Like the last part of your video.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

One of the things my favorite Uni professor shared with her students was enjoy beauty in and of itself. She came to that conclusion after struggling through her studies, and how political the topic of beauty was, as a Fine Arts major at UNLV.  4.

"as a trans-masculine NB person (probably, I'm figuring it out ok) I connect compliments about my appearance to femininity. Like, any time someone compliments my looks, I hear, 'YOU'RE A WOMAN.' I've always really despised looks-based compliments and never understood why other women got flattered by it, and I never really got why until I acknowledged I'm trans.  Because like, people don't compliment guys on their looks!   I definitely developed a 'not like the other girls' hate-on for make-up and femininity, which I convinced myself was internalized sexism for oh, about fifteen years.   Of all things, it was K-pop that made me okay with the idea of make-up and fashion. Like, seeing men looking pretty but also masculine just blew my little fucking mind. So there's a cultural element there. Like white american guys try to pretend they don't care about looks (and are generally slobs) but in other countries, it's normal for guys to groom.   On a slightly unrelated note, I also suffered severe cystic acne growing up (like literally whole face inflamed and red, think the before picture on an accutane commercial) and I actually think it impacted me for the better--in the sense that I don't nitpick my appearance now, and now that my skin is mostly clear, I think wow! lookin' pretty good! Back when my face was fucked, I used to watch videos of people with extreme facial deformities to make myself feel better. There's something to be said for perspective.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Why the fuck is my masculinity viewed as so fragile and theoretical that a hint of CHAPSTICK can raze it to the ground???? God damn! I want to be pretty and masculine is that so wrong?? I have floral shirts that have been shelved until my chest is not encumbered by feminine fat lumps, and I want a beard more and more because it will provide the societal shield that will contextualize my entire being and allow me actual freedom of style and expression again. Even looking at all the blogs of transmen documenting their transitions don't help cause I'm not binary enough of a man by trans standards either, but I'm not non-binary so....  And the niche of awesome transmen and NBs on instagram that pull off that tightrope of masculine and beautiful is no place for fat, old, pre-everything, baby trans who is far from a baby. It's not cute and no one wants people like me there. So I just feel wholly inadequate and unattractive no matter what I do.   TLDR; This video is all kinds of #relatable and also I think Natalie is beautiful, and I don't even want her to choke me lol","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a less attractive person I have a few thoughts on the topic of beauty. I do think that it is in the eye of the beholder in some aspect. You can care about someone so much that they are beautiful to you. Love is blind as they say. You can also see beauty in things not other people do. I myself have found a curvy plus size woman with soft back rolls as attractive and I have never known why. I have drawn the perfect flat back many times and seen this 'standard' body countless times before me, but when I first came across that hourglass sharpei body type I was floored by it. I am not joking at all. I have seen it on trans and cis woman alike, and sometimes I am saddened that it's an admiration I could not express and have others understand. That feeling of being an 'outlier' from everyone else by feeling something is beautiful that others do not is similar to being an ugly person.    Most of my thoughts on beauty come from personal experience of both being attractive and not attractive. I think society as a whole is suffering body dysphoria and that dysphoria is from media. I do think it is a problem, but saying that I don't think that make up is bad or that the absolutely stunning people of this world should disappear from among us. I simply think we need to see more than just that, and much of the body dysphoria will decrease. We need to see ugly people before us on camera just as much as beautiful people. And not in a circus freak show type of setting or a documentary about how desperately sad life is for ugly people. As just simply existing among the world's beautiful people, which is just an honest reflection of reality. We need to see ugly people because people don't know how to live their lives as ugly. We need to see aged people because people don't know how to live their live as aged. If you compare the faces of media even a few decades back what we applaud now as steps forward for body positivity just... was.    So much of our reputation is on the internet. Given we are beings who desperately care about socialization it makes the internet an important part of many people's self esteem in many many aspects. This is probably why people cat fish knowing that in the end they will be caught. It's sad too because often watching the catfish videos I find very often that the person being catfished is actually not that attractive themselves. It's often not the horror story dynamic of an ugly old man catfishing a young attractive person. It's two people who are often both quite young who are actually very similar in attractiveness but one of them is less in way that it's enough to make them do the desperate thing. They cling to that difference like their life is over if they can't date up to that slightly more attractive level. Of course some would say that places like the beauty industry push for this sort of desperation but as an ugly person I can honestly say there is more reasons to wear make up than to up your attractiveness. No amount of make up will make someone like me more attractive to the majority of the world, and yet I do enjoy wearing it because it is fun and expressive.     I think that our society has mishandled beauty. We have an issue with bias. The incels are right in a way that the world is cruel to the ugly. It is a marginalization that isn't talked about. It does contribute to less competent people getting promotions or getting jobs or higher pay. Not always, but it does happen. It is unfair in the same way that other biases are unfair. The only way to go against this is to simply learn to be around people who are not beautiful. For beautiful people to be kind and supportive of people who are not. Beauty itself is not the problem. As an artist I will today and to my last day love beauty with all my heart. It's the isolation of others within the scope of beauty that is the problem. I think it fuels a fear of not being beautiful in most people because no one wants to be othered; no one wants to be isolated.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"critique: women not wearing makeup isn't masculine. makeup isn't an inherent part of femininity, and the absence of it isn't masculine, but entirely neutral. caring about beauty isn't exactly frowned upon among women in general, maybe in some radfem circles but even then i would say most people who are critical of 'the beauty industry' try not to judge other women for being affected by societal pressure. i guess some radfems roll their eyes at hyper-femininity bc they see it as self-harm.  i think there's a lot of cognitive dissonance where people are critical of capitalism, shallowness, beauty standards etc. but it's very difficult to actually live by those standards if you're susceptible to societal pressure like... most people","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I don't know why, but for some reason I care way less about beauty than most people. Or at least in a different way. When I was a child I absolutly didn't want to look like a child and I hated looking and sounding like one. That's why I don't like being on photos and I would never upload Image or video of myself to the Internet. With that in mind, I kind of learned to not identify to much with how I looked and I displaced the thought about myself as somone who looks a certain way. I don't know if one would call that behaviour disphoria, alienation or if it is some completly different psychological mechanism.   Today (Im 20 now) it has gotten better with 'accepting' how I look (or more like getting used to),   because I still feel kind of distant to thinking about my own looks how I think other people do. The only time I actively worried about a detail, was a pretty big scar wich I concealed with Make-up or put a scarf on, and even in this situation it was less about thinking that the scar will make me look a lot more ugly, then it was about not wanting to be asked about and thereby associated with having had a disease and surgery, because I didn't want it to become part of my identity to others, when I myself didn't see it as that much of a life changing thing One could say I had cancer patient disphoria. I felt like a person who didn't have that traumatic experience (because I didn't fill that situation with that much meaning, never liked the dramatic way of how people cope with those situations) One could say in those regards Im kind of like Meursault from The Stranger.   Anyway,it isn't that I don't sometimes feel unattractive or want to look different.   But for being obsessed with changing my looks I would have to know how I want to look,   therefor I would have to know how I feel that I look, but I exactly don't know that.   It's super strange and with other people too. I, for example couldn't tell you what look I find attractive. One time a frind asked me (how many guys do regularly) If I thought a particular girl (I barely knew) was hot. I didn't know what to say, so I said 'I barely knew her so I couldn't tell' but by todays beauty standards 'yes, she would probably be considered hot'. I find some looks more attractive, but I can never tell why (maybe because I associate certain looks with personality traits of former crushes and relationships). I also don't really like the look of the 'beauty standard', because it looks kind of dull and boring and comercials have tought me to ignore it. + maybe I associate it with 'The Rich' wich I despise from a political point of view. Wich is all kind of sad becaus I worry about having a lot of prejudice about people who look like that.

"I feel that Beauty has value. Sure some are born with more attributes which allow them to be seen as beautiful than others.

"I once looked up the definition of ugly and the result I got was 'offensive to look at'. Upon reading that I actually cried because I realized this is how we take in the very very unattractive. I thought how terrible it would be for someone to have to exist not wanting to be seen because they know being seen offends the viewer. I also realized that means conversely that if ugliness offends then beauty pleases. And if offending people is undesirable then pleasing people is desirable. And if that's true than the pursuit of being more beautiful is not simply vanity but rather a virtue.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's different for women who are truly ugly. I had buck teeth that could put an eye out by age 8. By the time the orthodontics took, I was fat. Then I developed severe PCOS and got facial hair. I used to wear a full face of makeup all the time in high school. By college, I was down to just foundation to cover the beard shadow. I have never enjoyed makeup, but I wore it because I also hate being misgendered. I also hate doing my hair. It's falling out now too. I cover it with a head scarf to keep people from calling me 'sir.' I'm fat, balding, hairy and autistic. The journey from where I am to anything like beauty is so far that I gave up long ago. But I still spend money and do annoying shit like laser hair removal just so I can hopefully blend in and not be verbally abused for being ugly. And style is not an option for me because I'm poor and nice clothes don't come in my size anyway. I have often wondered about my gender identity. If I care so little about hair and makeup and clothes and traditional feminine things, and I look masculine anyway, shouldn't I just be a trans man? That feels like an easier option until someone calls me 'sir' and I cringe to my very soul. In the end, my gender is just a woman who is very bad at it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You're still a little bit clockable but I think shading? blending? that make up magic with foundation and shit would take care of that edge that you're trying to get in the pursuit of ever-elusive femininity. (Im cis and chubby with big boobs, in academia. Before I was, maybe a couple of incels would try to make me feel bad by 'doubting' my femininity, and GURL...haha)  I'm not a diehard fan because of your take on dreadlocks but I am subscribed and my mom's a doc, so I've lived with people obsessed with bone structure as well, lol. Remember to do your neck as well (with the contouring thing I mean, to make it look slimmer). You can go for more surgery but honestly you'd still want to do make up if you want to be traditionally pretty, so I'd say forgo more procedures and invest in make up lessons and expensive shit, I guess. And experiment with your hair, maybe waves or 'beach hair'. Volume is tantalizing, after all, lol. Also the color, if you don't mind dying it, get a consultation on some fancy ass place to see what is the best shade with your complexion and all of that. And regarding surgery, yes you could sculpt your cheeks more but honestly...99% of people -including ciswomen- fuck their structure and it rarely -if ever- looks good so...really, just make up. And even though I don't wear make up I am an authority on the matter because I am a Latina, born and bred, so you know I've been bombarded with unattainable beauty AND sensuality standards my whole freaking life, lol. Hope this helps. Love from a student in the Netherlands. Ah, if you could make your face more oval, so shave a millimeter or two from your temples, that would help. But honestly, I don't know. Make up make up make up. Your eyes are pretty set in, so the makeup should (somehow, no idea how it would be done) take depth away from them. I guess less black eyeliner? If you do do surgery, get one or two millimeters shaved from your brow area. That really does a world of difference.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

My expression was neutral, what came to be called Resting Bitch Face.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm so glad for this video, honestly. I've always struggled with how I look. I've never been thin, I've always been hairy. I spent years trying to cultivate good feelings about myself, inside and out. I dealt with two sort of earth-shattering traumas in the space of 5 years or so, then metaphorically clawed my way back to some semblance of normality through sheer force of will and therapy. I found meaningful friendships, a romantic relationship that fulfills me, I completed a bachelor's degree and then a master's degree, I got a job at a prestigious university. I built up self-confidence in all of those personal areas, and along the way had come to terms with my body. I'd say that I wasn't entirely happy with how I looked, but I didn't hate myself.  Then last year, about this time, I got cancer at age 25. I lost almost everything. I had to give up that great job that, due to capitalistic indoctrination, I had used to underpin so much of my identity. My relationship stayed strong - but we had to learn to deal with a relationship dynamic that no longer matched the one we had agreed on. And my body completely failed me at every turn. My hair, which had been so, so long my entire life, fell out, of course. The regimen of medication I was put on weakened me so much I couldn't exercise, wasted my muscles, and caused me to retain fat and water. I'm the heaviest I've ever been. I should be grateful to be alive, but all I can see is another situation where I have to rebuild my life from scratch. This combined with my other traumas made me question whether I even wanted to try to rebuild all of this. What's the use of accomplishing anything if it just keeps getting taken away over and over? I do it now (as I have done for years) for other people, and not really for myself.  I don't think I've ever despised my body so much as I do now. I'm working hard to regain my strength and feel good about myself again. And I really had to check the privilege that I did have before, to be able-bodied, to at least not hate my body even if I didn't like it much. I'm about 9 months cancer free. But the experience, the toll on my physical self and my emotional self - those are mine to keep. Forever.   So hearing this helps. I want to feel beautiful again. I didn't always feel it before, but when I did, it propped up all of the other things that I liked about myself. I was successful, smart, kind, and beautiful. Now I'm a work in progress. These feelings of guilt for even wanting to be beautiful are even more pronounced when you're disabled - the feeling is 'oh, well you have enough to worry about! Don't worry about being beautiful too!' And nothing tears down beauty standards quite like finally being free of all that unwanted hair - only you have to lose all of it, even the hair you like! So thank you for this nuanced take, from one Natalie to another.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"My crush, way older than me, is a pretty busty, tall and chunky woman. Everything about her is wider and bigger than me. Her jaw, her eyes, mouth, arms, legs.  I'm young and I guess kind of good-looking. Just skinny and a little short. We look absurd next to each other. I suspect she doesn't feel very feminine with me.. In some ways she looks more masculine than me, but at the same time not at all. I once saw her without makeup, and she did look sick, old and tired, but I still found her sexy.  Then she cut all her hair of, and I really didn't like it, but she still turned me on. I even mistook her for a man on the street once, from a distance. She in no way has a masculine face, it's very feminine actually, but she's not small and frail or any of that. It kind of highlights her feminine traits even more. In her case, her eyes, nose, mouth, and her voice and softness. When she was younger and skinnier she must have been amazingly beautiful. I think many still find her good looking and attractive, partly thanks to her style and sensual communication.  This story had no point.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Anyways, I am delighted by this video. Seems like you are really getting your stuff together and finding a good balance in life. I just want to say, in general, you have always looked like an androgyne-toward-the-feminine to me, personally. Like, I perceive you as 95% female and 5% boy, if that makes any sense. Personally, I like that bit of boy I see in you, and I hope you hold on to it even as you transition. Carry it through the transition, let the boy become the tomboy! ;D I know nothing can calm the agitations of self criticism but, personally, you always come across to me as clean, smooth, youthful, ladylike, etc. Even your 'base face' at this point is just perfect to me. That's just me, though. >.> I think you will always 'feel the way you felt before'. I say this as a person who is in that same boat. I am like an opposite side to your coin. I have embraced the decay. That is not to say I don't try to beautify myself to a degree, but, I don't do as much as I could. You, on the other hand, you go all out and you nail it.

"I guess the thing that really helped me was training myself to see non beauty and inherently harmless and unrepulsive, rather than forcing myself to pretend I didnt care about beauty. Even I was the most perfect specimen in the world, theres eventually going to be days where I develop pimples, or gain weight, and I know its sounds silly but all those things used to feel like unforgivable crimes to me when I was younger, instead of being relatively minor happenings with no real impact on my life. Not only that they're nowhere as disgusting as coded by alot of skin care adverts; my gf once told me my pimples were kind of cute and my dark circles were adorable and I know she meant it, and it's the same way I treat her so why wouldn't that be hard to accept? I think our skincare is also a way for us to reaffirm the idea of being precious or worth investing and non beauty shouldnt make us stop that. And I say non beauty because it frees me from the burden of trying to love things I find genuinely ugly about myself or in other people. Idk it's worked for me as someone with body dysmorphia and I hope everyone else finds a way to work with their insecurities as well","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I love your videos but I think you might have made some really unfortunate assumptions about women who choose not to wear makeup, and oversimplified the problem with beauty. I'm not against makeup, I put on a minimal amount of makeup if I want to. (Tinted moisturizer, brow gel, mascara, blush) . I just want to look and feel like myself, so I don't bother most days. I just think that we all have been indoctrinated to care a little too much about how we are seen by other people, and not enough about how we contribute to the world and our communities. I think she never addressed the largest issue with beauty standards: Beauty is not a virtue. And even if our society treats it like it is, we shouldn't. Women especially are reared to care about beauty as a matter of self worth and that's what made me uncomfortable with this video. It didn't address that but shifted the focus to style. And while I find her solution interesting, I think style is also problematic for the same reasons beauty standards are: you are basing some of your worth solely on how you look on a given day, and some people are systematically barred from building and propagating their own aesthetics because of class and body shape. More than anything I think that she left out a real possibility: choosing to be upfront about these issues and not taking part in the problematic behavior that the beauty-industrial complex urges us to. What if we didn't give people attention because they are nice to look at, what if we were so comfortable with ourselves that wearing makeup was truly a matter of style, and not something that we use to boost our self esteem, what if we consistently refused to make womanhood a performance, what if we treated beauty as simply another characteristic, like height, shoe size, right handedness, or or the ability to smell asparagus in your pee. We all recognize those things in others but it's rarely attached to their worth. And we can change society too! Society and cultures only change when individuals in them push social norms by simply embodying their values. For Queer people, we had to come out of the closet and live out our love in the open. For minorities we openly exercise and protect our cultures even when it's hard. And for women we have to separate beauty from our self worth and how we perceive others. We need to check our beauty biases, and we need to realize that feeling beautiful isn't the only way to appreciate our bodies.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Beauty is veery in perspective.You are your own judge of the beauty not the system made to appeal for just men or smth. Become a fashion advisor,boost up your confidence. Search for amazing people that Rock themselves in any shape and color.   Maybe wear brighter make-up.There's no doubt you have got a fashion sense more than anyone. Here's to me I would add being a bit taller and sturdy when for some others a certain fixed standard would be perfect nonetheless. Maybe there's lots of insecurity thoughs coming from your environment about themselves(trans, girls women, etc), then affecting you, like a copied thinking, without knowing. Being much more cuter and younger would be just genes and applying a few make-up I think. Nonetheless I wouldn't force or psychologically torture myself for a change, ironically, said rich pretty girl, if needed there's another generation still able for growing and adapting to climate, atmosphere etc. You look very much as a woman, with a male genes and some of its social construction followed, you're doing preeeeety Excellent!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"So like, I like the idea of prioritizing style over beauty, but I also feel like that would just replace privileges based on physical appearance with those based on class, you know?     Having a curated and distinct style is expensive (either in terms of money or in terms of time, labor and skill level needed to make and/or alter clothes) and inaccessible to many people, especially fat people and people with atypically-shaped bodies. There's also the mental and emotional energy costs of putting together haschtague lewks all the time, as well as the extra care and awareness they might necessitate; I'm thinking of this one pair of white shoes that I never wear because they're impossible to clean and constantly avoiding getting them dirty is exhausting. For a lot of working class people, particularly those already in marginalized groups, style is a luxury they can't afford.  I realize We Live In A Society and so it's inevitable that our value is going to be tied somehow to wealth and economic class, but I just feel like many of the same people who currently get shat upon for not being '''beautiful''' enough would also be shat upon for not being stylish enough. But then again, I don't really have a good alternative suggestion besides, like, not basing our worth as human beings on the free market exchange value of our lives but LOLZ GOOD LUCK WITH THAT","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I don't give a shit about beauty. But I do resent the fact that, because I don't care about beauty, it will negatively impact me in terms of my professional life and how much respect I'll get from others. Studies back this up.

Whether she chooses, like Contra, to use surgery and makeup to both express herself and deal with mental issues, or, like me, she chooses not to wear jackshit and likely takes a social or professional blow.

"I find your video very interesting because I'm currently writing my bachelor thesis about sex work, sex robots and sex as a commodity. Doing my reasearch I read an interesting book from a sociologist who writes about how the body, especially the female body, is a commodity - literally and in a symbolic way. Thesis is (simplified): the sexualised body generates capital and women can, in theory, generate capital and economic power with their bodies (so it`s not the main focus to attract a partner - thats just one out of many reasons, most of the time we don`t try to be attractive to achieve something conciously. It`s to avoid disadvantage and to fit in). But because sexualised bodies are everywhere, the female body is often degraded, the beauty standards for women count on short-living standards (like youth) and there is so much competition, it is hard to generate economic or symbolic worth. That is the point of capitalism: The commodified sexual body has to lose worth and you constantly have to regain that worth. And we all know how money can be generated with the pressure to be attractive: Clothes, makeup, surgery, dieting... You name the industry. I just thought throwing that out might be interesting. For me it was.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Grooming customs around body hair never made sense to me. Greeks and Romans removed pretty much everything, because anthropocentrism and cult of the human body. Middle Ages stepped back from anything remotely vain or groomful because something-something body sinful and flesh filthy, why bother. In consecutive eras the customs changed a bit here and there, for instance XVIII century men would be likely to get all smooth while it wasn't in fashion for women. And all the way to XX century women didn't bother aside from the parts of their body that were showing, which was literally nothing (try to show an ankle as an Edwardian lady and you'd have gentlemen fainting around you). But because the industrial revolution and emancipation that followed from 1920's onward resulted in fashion changes, women were suddenly showing way more skin. So everything that was now not covered by cloth had to look nice and smooth... Men, however, had long trousers and long sleeves for most of the time, so it wasn't of concern for them. However, their attire also got less modest(?) to the present day, it's just the habits regarding body hair haven't exactly caught up. Some of them start to take care of themselves, but overall there's indeed way less pressure and you can easily see a man wearing shorts with his furry legs showing. Not a sight anyone really wants to see, so maybe over some extended period of time we will see that changing as well. Who knows","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"(As always, mad respect to Natalie, and this comment isn't meant as a judgment of her or her decisions at all. I admit that I'm bothered by this topic and I'm trying to figure out why.) I think the thing that bothers me about people (okay, mainly just cis women) going to expensive, invasive lengths to conform to beauty standards is that the more the general population molds themselves, the higher the bar keeps rising for everyone. We're collectively pushing the standards farther and farther away from what's actually in our genetic code.   You almost have to get plastic surgery just to look normal. You have to spend hundreds of dollars every month on creams and makeups and treatments in order to really stand out as beautiful unless you're very young and very blessed. And if you opt to spend your money and time on other things, you risk being outright ugly in the eyes of society. It's a conundrum for me because I know that I value other things more highly than the way light bounces off of me, and yet that deep desire to be beautiful is there and it gets harder and harder to fulfill with both age and rising standards working against me.  What does it say about our value as people? And what we value? We spend so. much. money on this shit. And it's none of my business how other people choose to spend their money, but the fact that we feel compelled, pressured, even obligated to buy this crap is what I'm not okay with. It's a vicious, self-perpetuating cycle, and people are getting rich off of it.  I can't help thinking that if we could just resist a little bit, things might be better. If we could post photos of our actual faces. If we could quit pointing out our flaws. If we could dare to look imperfect once in a while and try to celebrate and praise other things besides beauty.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Maybe I sound like the biggest sourpuss of all time, but it's almost painful to see so many people in the comments chanting 'you are beautiful!' as if all that Natalie needs to be convinced of her own beauty is a critical mass of reassurance from her fans. It seems to me that even if compliments from strangers provide a temporary rush of dopamine, so much focus on Natalie's physical appearance ultimately feeds into an obsession with beauty that's clearly causing her to suffer. The endless demands of adhering to conventional beauty standards are agonizing enough for cis women, trans women are subject to even harsher scrutiny, and yet the overwhelming response to a video deeply exploring that struggle is a chorus of people saying 'look how pretty you are!' This video helped me better understand the social and psychological role of make-up and facial surgery, and I like the idea of 'style' being a separate concept that could perhaps supplant or stand in for conventional beauty, as it seems far more personal and meaningful than simply judging one's proximity to an unattainable ideal. But in the end I was left feeling concerned for Natalie, who seems so dismally resigned to forever chasing that ideal to her own detriment. It would be one thing if she relished the pursuit, as many seem to, but it's pretty clear that the desire for beauty causes more pain than joy in the case of Natalie and perhaps the majority of women, cis and trans alike. Where do we go from here? Because I don't think we're getting anywhere by building social media echo chambers of relentless positivity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I would always pride myself in being more the 'intellectual' type that was supposedly above the frey when it came to 'frivolities' of this kind.

It wasn't until I was 26 when I started noticing the corners of my hairline receding that my appearance became a greater focus. I'm in my early 30's now and, other than that, I still have a full head of hair, but I did consult a dermatologist about my options in case things got worse.

Beauty and the concept of beauty and how conflicted I am because of that desire of being beautiful, knowing damn well it's shallow and stressful.   I can't help going through instagram and stalking these beautiful women and feeling so... inadequate.  (especially when I found my crush liking their photos and commenting on their breathtaking looks) People always tell me I'm pretty and sometimes I feel like that, but I know I will never be as beautiful as those girls... I used to think, well, at least I'm an interesting person (?? ... And I have a nice body...  Well, those girls are beautiful and very interesting too, they have the whole package, something that I don't have.  Then, comes the guilt, as you said, first because I don't have it as bad as other people, second, there are more important things to focus on (even on a personal level) and here I am feeling depressed because there are women more beautiful than I'll ever be...

We won't speak about the sagging of said t!ts. Gravity is a harsh mistress.  So yeah, I'm about to hit 50. And I am no longer valuable or attractive. I swear it's bc my only value is the ability to pop out babies for cis white bois. I'm not only no longer beautiful, I'm no longer visible. But guess what? I'm not playing their game. I'm not your womb on wheels.  Your video was AMAZING and inspiring and reminded me that my beauty is for me. It's not like I'd let those judgey bois anywhere near me anyway. I'm gonna wear what I want (I do anyway. My spawn calls me Goth Mrs Weasley. At least it's a look?) and gonna makeup how I want.

"As A tRaNs MaN, I always feel a pressure from society to hypermasculinize. BUTT I have always had a thing for trying to be beautiful. What can I say except that my brain contains a raging biological twink. My dream style has always been 'rainbow goth smashed haphazardly into a hot elven dude' look. I've had top surgery and was on T for several years, but also I love my hair long, and I love gender-ambiguous clothing, I wear eye-shadow and nail polish, and I love confusing the cishets. It took me years after coming out to be comfortable doing any of that though, as I was constantly misgendered if I wore anything except plaid buttoned shirts, baggy pants, and short boring hairstyles. Then I said fuck it, and I still get misgendered a lot but I got to the point where I stopped giving a shit what random strangers said about me.  In any case, thank you for being so honest and vulnerable with us. If you enjoy beauty, enjoy it! It is lots of fun to get all dolled up. You don't have to give up something you love to do in order to deal with the inner demons that make you feel shitty about yourself.

"So this is where the worldwide sequin shortage comes from! (Well, you and Takarazuka Revue, I suppose.) That style working great for you <3. I would love to be beautiful and/or stylish, but that would require effort and in the end what always wins is me being lazy. I last wore make-up going to see Bohemian Rhapsody at the end of last year... so I (cis F, presumably) cosplayed as a 30+ guy cosplaying a schoolgirl, which... kinda worked for me :D. When I do put on make-up I always end up looking as 'still me', which is the wrong thing to look like, so that successfully kills all motivation to do it again anytime soon. Too much effort for not enough difference. So, there's that, not having enough f**** to give...  Also, Detective Pikachu is so adorable and fluffy and I want one.

I guess working in front of a screen/mirror/behind a camera might make you more focused on your looks. If I started using makeup to look perfect on a regular basis, it would probably completely ruin my self-worth, and I would probably end up wanting to make permament changes to my face to hide my imaginary (or real) imperfections. I already have that problem with physical excercise, wanting to improve my body and imagining what it would be like to starve myself to a point where there is no fat on my body.  I remember back in high school, I wouldn't go outside if I didn't have hair gel or wax, or just a bad hair day. Don't know if it was beauty standards or just anxiety.

"Literally the only thing I am not 100% on board with is the idea that women in academia who don't put effort into their looks is mainly because of pressure to be masculine or because of some 'not like other girls' bs. I'm a cis female college student (but also a lesbian so I got excused a little later in the video ) who doesn't do my hair or make up, and generally just wears whatever is comfortable, but that IS actually because I don't care. Not that I don't care to be beautiful, I think everyone does. It is because I don't care enough to wake up early and put the effort in (or even put the effort in to learn how to do these things in the first place). I'm also going to school for opera performance though so I do have to be feminine and beautiful a lot of the times, and whenever someone does my make up really well and puts me in a wig for a performance, it does feel really awesome, and part of me wishes I DID care enough to do that every day, but... I'm just too lazy for the most part lol. I honestly admire my woman friends who do put that effort in. I also can't say I'd feel the same if I were trans either though, because I feel like society makes trans people have to 'prove' that they are the gender they identify as, whereas everyone just accepts I'm a woman without me having to actually do anything about it.   On another note, I've always found you to be beautiful and very feminine, but post-surgery it is like... a different sort of femininity. Your face looks so soft and cute and pretty, kind of fairy-like [?]  I wish you all the best in everything you do, I am so grateful for your channel and for your willingness to be open to the scum of the internet!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Here's an absolute truth: I had no idea who this woman is, or what she does.  I found her because my son played a video by a guy named Shaun.  The guy is pretty smart and has good ideas, so I watched more of his stuff.  On his channel, in the 'liked videos' section, was on called 'Incels', by Contrapoints.  Since I'm cooking a book about the gradual degeneration and ultimate disintegration of society as we've known it and a large part of that book will concern tribalism and factionalism as groups of people splinter away from modern lifestyles as civilization collapses, I thought 'I wonder what this hot chick thinks about this odd and rather silly subgroup of men that spend all their time hating women on-line because they can't get laid?'  I must note they're only odd and silly until one of them grabs the nearest, readily available, firearm and goes off to shoot random women.  It stops being odd and silly and turns into tragically grotesque.  But, I digress.  So, I'm watching this video, having never seen this woman before and having no idea of her work, and I wouldn't have known she was born a man until she made some reference to it.  So, if it's 'passing' that is what she's worried with, she can stop.  She had me fooled all day.  So, even though I don't like the word 'fan', because it's short for 'fanatic', I would consider myself to be one of her's.  The woman is pretty brilliant.  In fact, if I ever were to meet a woman with the vast reserves of intelligence and creativity that this one possesses, I'd probably marry her in a heartbeat.  Because this is the sort of person you could have a conversation with every day for thirty years and never have the same one twice.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Love the video but found a flaw in your makeup argument. Women wearing makeup in jail proves nothing. I'm not debating what percentage Peterson was right about about makeup. I honestly don't care enough to debate it. Just that you're not factoring in instinct, and how long an instinctual act must be redundant before said act ceases. And it's certainly not within a human lifetime. Most animals augment their physical appearance to show fertility somehow. Human women use makeup. Even if men aren't around, and continued to be not around for hundreds or potentially even thousands of years, women could still continue to use makeup out of instinct. I'm watching my house cat right now freaking out because there's a bird outside. Another 10,000 years may go by of house cats not needing to hunt and they will still want to kill every bird they see. So I think for you to prove your point, we'd have to somehow isolate many generations of women in a prison for hundreds of years. But even then, the appearance fertility may become revered for other reasons. Skill on applying makeup in that case could become a symbol of dominance. A new context for female only hierarchies to form. You're basically trying to say that applying makeup is not instinctual. Every women claims she wears makeup because she 'likes it', or it 'makes me feel good'. But every single thing a human does that feels good, feels good because it has a purpose for survival and procreation. It's just really hard to swallow when every woman on earth just happens to 'like' wearing makeup and we're supposed to believe it's not instinctually driven? Also, men don't stop doing masculine things that attract females when they're in prison. So let's not forget that humans are just intelligent animals that get born, fuck, multiply and die just like every other animal. Our rituals are sill quite primal if you put them under scrutiny.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i know it was a short bit just at the end, but style vs beauty is SUCH a good example of 'look how YOU want yourself to look, and youll look amazing' and 'the perfect accessory for every outfit is confidence'. if you find that you enjoy and are happy about how you look, no matter how you look or what you wear, you will look good in it because it will be YOUR look. sadly building up confidence for your own style vs just doing what beauty standards want you to do has to be both an individual and societal effort. who enforces beauty standards? individual people. who makes beauty standards? society. i dont imagine this is something that will ever be resolved, but its good to surround yourself with people who can appreciate and encourage your personal style while still being objective enough to let you know when something doesnt fit you. not what doesnt fit their vision of you, but when something doesnt fit who you are. definitely not a definitive and cut-and-dry topic to discuss, but VERY important for people to try to understand and be aware of.

"As a cis gender female who was in a PhD program, my own reason for usually not wearing makeup has nothing to do with appearing less feminine. Mostly it is because makeup takes a lot of effort. But also I actually don't wear makeup because of vanity. Every time I wear eye makeup I have to wash it off. And the washing causes some of my real, naturally long and dark eyelashes to fall out. Every time I wear concealer I risk it causing me to break out the next day.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I think there are better odds to cure cancer than be found beautiful by universal standards. The aim these days is to present a clean, elegant and stylish self, it indeed includes make up but in a conceal/enhance natural way with a bit of whimsy depending on the occasion. Finally I above all use make up to match how I feel inside to the outside. Even the happiest person with dark circles and acne will look tired and terrible on a smiling picture.

I don't judge anyone else for wearing makeup and I certainly don't do anything to be 'not like other girls' because girls are awesome no matter how they present themselves, I just don't have the desire to do it myself.

"Your results look great! I disagree that 'smart people' don't care what they look like; the smart ones know there is a need to code switch depending on the social context. I don't wear makeup, shave, etc. at home; however, I know that in order to get a job or be taken seriously, I have to 'femme' it up A LOT in order to achieve the outcomes I need to survive. Cocky people (who believe they are smarter than everyone) don't code switch and then get angry when societal expectations prevent them from progressing. As a lesbian, I'd love it if looks didn't persuade outcomes, but we aren't identical blind grey alien blobs and we aren't that progressive to resist judgments based on looks; so take some pride and care into how you look to achieve your goals. It's hard as a not-so-feminine lesbian who also doesn't pull off the masculine swag (lol) type look. I find myself rarely feeling 'pretty', about once a month too. I don't think I'm ugly often either though, just some weird limbo version of okay. My wife, who nearly everyone including myself says is insanely beautiful, thinks she's hideous.

"I definitely agree that not all gender dysphoria is in a vacuum! I dealt with realizations that a lot of my chest dysphoria was bc I felt I 'had' to want to remove my breasts to 'prove' I was nonbinary. But why does breastlessness indicate I don't have a binary gender? It doesn't. But because I'm read as female I'm expected to change the things people see as inherently feminine.

"I've always thought the term 'reconstructive surgery' used in the context of SRS and FFS was misleading.  I had a conversation with another well known trans youtuber about the use of the term, and she argued that FFS was reconstructing what testosterone took away from her. My counter arguments is that A: you don't know what you would have looked like as an adult had you been a cis woman, and B; then people who have plastic surgery/procedures to take away signs of aging are also having reconstructive surgery/procedure to reconstruct what time took away from them. But we openly and rightly so call bullshit on the latter misuse of the term. And it's not like people who get FFS are interested in looking like ugly women either, they want to be beautiful women (if you're going under the knife, might as well). So this isn't about looking more feminine or passing more, this also just about looking more beautiful. So let's just call a spade a spade and not use the 'reconstructive' term. I think that applies more to people who have been in accidents or who have been the victim of violent assault, for example a person who had half their face melted off is now getting reconstructive surgery to make their face look more like what they used to look like before the incident.   I'm pretty we can find a different term to fill in onto insurance forms that gives people financial assistence with FFS.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I haven't finished the video yet (23:00) but I just have to tell you something:  YOU'VE BEEN LIED   What about? About the importance of beauty! It is just as important as anything else, just as important as any other personal characteristic. It is in our nature, everyone's nature. We want to be succesful, be recognised by others and feel good, and that's FINE! Fitness, health, beauty, apparel... all those things indicate good genes, wealth, good habits, good life, even the intelligence to overcome other shortoffs during your lifetime.   E.g., if you are unlucky and you're propense towards obesity, a strong will and proper knowledge can get you out of it in most cases. In your case, hard work and surgical procedures. And that's fine!   But the thing is that you only hear people screaming that beauty is superficial, it is unimportant... But that's fake. Those people either are not sensitive to aesthetics, are not beautiful or they just try to get rid of competition... either conciuosly or not. The people who are beautiful are so deep inside their own 'first class beauty people' problems that they don't have time or need to complain about it.   So, TL;DR: Everything is important. Don't be obsessed on just one single aspect of your personal characteristics. Do something to be the best version of yourself, try to feel good with yourself, and do it in a relaxed manner. And just live, eat and have fun ;)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I grew up a little and although I'm still young I'm less punk that I was and cultivating style was how I sought out of the spiral myself. Obvious dysphoria and society still gets me real down sometimes and I even had an ed for a while because of it, but finding a subculture that was about rejecting beauty and going for the opposite of beauty really helped me accept that beauty wasn't an option, and that I would survive and maybe even flourish without being beautiful.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I appreciate the discussion on whether FFS is cosmetic surgery or corrective surgery, as well as the difference between choosing to pursue to look more female versus more feminine.  I underwent FFS some ... umm ... thirteen years ago?  I was living semi-stealth in Northampton at the time, a super queer town. I say semi because it was never intentional so much as people in super queer Northampton just assumed that the masculine person with boobs was either a butch lesbian or a trans man, not a crowdagger who just happened to be 'taught womanhood' by some kind butches in a North Hollywood bar.  Oh the irony.  Having FFS brought me out of that closet because people recognized some of the bruising and assumed I had undergone a cosmetic face lift. 23 year old me was afraid of being seen as vain so I quicky admitted to having undergone FFS (which I saw as a corrective procedure for me) rather than let folk see mas someone who wanted to look younger in my twenties.  Trans woman removing bone to look like she was born less male? SURE!  Someone who would go under the knife for mere vanity...? UNTHINKABLE!

"To counteract the phones issue, I recommend looking at your face and body everyday and consciously thinking about what you like about it. Just as you can train yourself to spot perceived flaws, you can train yourself to focus on what you like about yourself too. Maybe you don't like much at first but just trying to focus on what you like will make it easier over time. I discovered this worked for me years ago after watching that viral video 'To This Day' by Shane Koyczan. The poem resonated with me and I took its advice seriously and it helped me. Maybe it's not ideal for everyone but I do recommend it: URL  Also, when you're a woman, and you may have noticed this, a lot of other women in your life can passive aggressively compliment you. I guess you'd call it negging but with no ulterior motive but to make someone feel like crap. My 'friends' growing up used to say things like 'I'm so insecure about my weight and what I wear. I wish I had your confidence to just not care how I dressed or what I looked like. I'm so jealous.' Like, gee, thanks I guess. It's more subtle as an adult but that issue of 'complements' that aren't particularly nice is still there. Don't let that get in your head if you experience either.   Those are my two bits of unsolicited advice.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

In all seriousness, my personal standards of my own beauty baffle me sometimes - and I say this as a cishet guy who's not supposed to be as fussed about all that stuff.

And, finding men repulsive, I can't feel I can give an accurate representation of how attractive I actually am, because, well, I'm a man and therefore aren't attractive at all. All things considered, my virility would probably be held in higher regard if I let my facial hair grow. It's growth is not overly patchy, and would probably mature into a proper beard (though with a little too much concentration on the neck) if I let it grow out, but in spite of this perceived benefit, I don't do that, because I really hate facial hair, and hate how it looks and feels on me.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I find it so hard to relate to the struggle for 'beauty' but we all at the very least experience unwarranted backlash for simply existing in a society that thrives on pointless biases. Some of us allow it to affect us more than others. I consider myself to be beautiful, but it doesn't have anything to do with standards. I don't meet them, especially not here in Japan. It's just a simple matter of my face/body being aesthetically pleasing to my brain. It means no matter how many adverse indications I receive for not playing this game (the endless, rewardless pursuit of the unattainable), my brain still processes the face and body it sees as pleasing, and that in turn is how I see myself. I have good days and bad days, but the bad days don't count because it's irrational to allow the deviation of the 'truth' to interfere with what's constant. It sounds like it's the opposite for Natalie, and that is a true shame. She has such an incredible command of nearly every medium she touches. There is so much to her, beauty, complexity, eloquence, wit. And all of it encompasses her 'style'. It's fearsome!

I think the point of critiquing the norms of beauty is to get the *looker* to change their view, not the *person being looked at*. I've become a lot more flexible about how I see people as 'beautiful', personally, because I was persuaded to examine why I find certain looks attractive and I started to realize that there's beauty to be found in people who don't look like Barbie and Ken.  in other words we have to draft laws to force people to date trans women pass it on","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Phew. I wasn't sure if I should comment. I watch all of your videos but I pretty much never comment because I don't feel like any of your videos are directed *at* me since I'm a cis woman (i guess?) But this video was the first time I felt like I was being spoken to directly in some kind of way. I'm so glad you do that much introspection and critical thinking about beauty and how complex it is. I've never said anything about it before because I want to be supportive, but I can never help but feel a little bothered by the pursuit of conventional beauty like you described it. I'm fat and hairy and don't wear makeup. Not conventionally attractive. I struggle in particular with my body hair because I'm so concerned about what other people think that i'm in a constant daily battle with plucking and shaving all the hairs off my entire face and neck for fear that I'm gonna get some nasty comment and then I go straight into work where little kids grab my arm hairs and ask me why I have these and I always want to say 'I don't know! Ask my fucking parents!'   But even if I did let every hair grow out and get a nice mustache and unibrow going, nobody on the street is going to say I'm not a woman. And I know that's so unfair to trans women. But like you said, it's complicated. Everyone would acknowledge me as a woman, but not bangable or worthy of attention. I get totally ignored. I'm never harassed OR pursued by anyone. I can't even relate to all these 'universal woman experiences' like getting catcalled or having uncomfortable encounters with pushy strangers. With my minimum of face grooming and long jeans I'm just passable enough not to inspire any kind of emotion from strangers. I'm a ghost. But I'm still a woman, so isn't being fat, hairy, and yet somehow invisible also part of the 'woman experience'? It is a woman's experience, same with all cis and trans women and whatever they look like. But the 'aesthetic' of a woman as dictated by beauty standards is an entirely different thing. And I can say with certainty that it has undeniable social power.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think at some point it's worth separating the want to feel good about yourself from the moving parts of your situation. Being content seems to be different and unrelated from being happy. Striving towards beauty or style is a good step towards being happy about your skin-suit but also maybe its also just nice to have a hobby you can make meaningful strides in that receive some level of recognition for. I find if I feed that desire for validation snd working on a project larger than me too much it consumes me until little things no longer bring me happiness. Cooking, making music, painting, reading fluffy fiction, or otherwise picking up less competitive lower stakes creative hobbies turned out to be the kind of stuff I needed to start doing every so often in order to be less miserable (along with going cold turkey on the negative self-talk)    I don't know if you've considered therapy but there are trans-friendly therapists around these days and it's nice to have someone to talk to that isn't a friend but is there to help you make your life feel more sustainable and less like a goddamn marathon  Or alternatively you can do the worse thing where you do psychedelics and put yourself in increasingly compromising sexual situations","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Mate you could've been a fine healthy dude without having to go through any of this nonsense. You had normal heterosexual relationships. Now instead you have your skin cut off and bones chiseled off to look more feminine. You fetishized your sexual attraction to the point of getting a high from being the sexual object you so desired, that's why you try so hard to be beautiful. You reversed the roles by pretending to be the girl you always wanted to have is now you. I can imagine the same thing - if I imagine myself as a cute young girl as I get fucked by some hot guy I do get a sexual kick out of it, but I understand that's just because I like the SCENARIO - meaning I want to fuck a cute young girl, not necessarily be one. You pushed a sexual delusion so far that you're taking hormones and cutting off pieces of your skull - if this is not mental illness, then what is?

"So Nat, - i have to say, that i can understand why you got your Facial operations, and for the most part - honestly - i like it. I prefer your old nose, but that is because i liked how you looked anyway. It if suits your needs i totally understand.  I am nonbinary, but present as a women, and i also use Makeup to accentuate my face. Not always in a feminine way, simply to push out what is generally percived as beautiful (i.e. high cheekbones, but i also make them manly, hollow) In fact, i hate subjecting to current beauty standards. As a rule of thumb, my makup consists of what i *feel* like - that is why i watch tutorials, but don't follow them. I do what i wanna do.    Generally, as a rule of thumb, i am against cosmetic surgery for any type of reason, so far so that i am literally appalled and disgusted by fake boobs and wouldn't touch them. Cosmetic surgery is one of my dealbreakers, and i struggle to see myself as an ally to the trans community because of it!  On the one side; i am also not cis, and have dismorphia (so i can relate, at least a bit.) and am pansexual.  While i came to the conclusion that i would feel 'complete' with a additional dick to my current setup (vagina, + boobs) - the Lack of dick doesn't make me *suffer* As i suffer from Borderline Personality disorder i regularly am subjected to Body Dismorphia, so i can understand the need to be beautiful and the need to be who you see yourself as, that being said: I engage with trans people through twitter a lot, and i want them to be happy and do what they wanna do, and have surgery if they decide it is necessary,  but at the same time, **it feels wrong to excluding someone on the basis of their treatment toward gender disphoria..**  I really struggle with this.. is it wrong? am i right? Is it a overreactive Dealbreaker?  Should i check my priviledge (really - no memeing or kidding) Maybe its my inherent bias that people with cosmetic surgery are too shallow, or maybe it is something else. Right now im not sure.   I am a fan of you. I love you like a friend, and sometimes i dream of you being my bigger sister. I aspire to be strong in my feminity like you are. And *dang gurrrl* your Hair got Treatment too? it is *fucking* beautiful?  Give it some time, meditate, and listen to some good music that makes your Feminity pop like your facetuned Eyeshadow.

"Existence is an exercise in esteem-tension for me. My instinct is to want to feel, if not necessarily naturally beautiful, then certainly naturally adequate. My bold and lofty ideal is universal adequacy.  I feel the same way about basic makeup as you do about touching up your face in photos. When I fall into the habit of wearing foundation every day, my own human face begins to look disgusting to me. I yearn for a reflection that doesn't disappoint me, but I also do want to feel actively pretty sometimes. The tension comes from an almost enraging awareness that my poor self-image comes from external sources. I only feel like my pores are huge and my eyebrows patchy because flawless airbrushed celebrities and mascara ads inundate my life with that message. And the stupid ass men who can't figure out that women do in fact have human skin are the final straw on that pile.  The double standard in daily presentation between the average pore-having man at the office, and a woman, keeps me at a low level boil. I just want to feel good enough for like, ONE SECOND. I don't want to balance getting a precious extra half hour of sleep vs. feeling like roadkill if I don't do some makeup. I bitterly stoke this coal of resentment in my heart all while jumping through the hoops anyway. It makes me feel like a bad woman AND a bad feminist. It's also one of the reasons I love bold eyeshadow and lipstick. The kinds of makeup that aren't 'stealth enhancements' are safe in my mind because they are like clothes. It's my real face, with purple and red paint on it. It's adornment, not concealment. I don't know, I guess essentially I disagree with the idea that social obsession with beauty has much to do with what reads to us as healthy per se, or with any 'natural' urges at all. Is poreless skin healthy? Are big eyelashes healthy? Adornment, now, is a well resesrched and fascinating behavior in all human societies and many animal ones. But as I established, adornment and concealment are different things. Of course, there are places where the border between the two is hazy. But overall I'd say the modern evolution of minor enhancements to the base appearance is not only different from how we've practiced adorment throughout human history, but is also fundamentally fucking with our brains. People have no idea what's normal anymore. Even knowing about it, we see 'improved' women constantly on the streets, in stores, at work. The lower bar for average keeps sliding up, and it's only ever creating more teenagers with body dysmorphia and depression every year. I don't know what to do about it and the grinding wheel torments me into pleasing it even though I perceive how flawed and unfair the system is. I just want to not feel like shit for something so fucking irrelevant to who I am as a human being.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Same goes for having a nice jawline, a small nose, a thin body, an actual ass that isn't flat, ect. I know it's dumb because that's not what makes a woman a woman, but because so many girls around me have at least one of those societal perfections, I feel like I'm under the baseline of what is considered normal.

Or they look kind of 'Mannish' so they assume they can't be beautiful EVER as a female.  And society reassured them it is true!   But it isn't true!  And furthermore it doesn't matter because is damaging to the individual to imply they have to change physically to be okay.   NO.  That's NEVER a good philosophy!  Even for a woman living in todays fucked up hyper social Darwinist whatever society.  And like....smh....this is all getting out of control.  I wish I could hang out with you Nat and we could just talk.  Maybe I'm wrong but I'm worried about this self immolating pursuit for 'hotness' or 'beauty' if you prefer.  But we know this is about hotness not beauty...   people want to be wanted and that is their primary goal and society has taught them that it is their primary goal.  The cognitive bias is sos throng that we're saying it's okay to bend your self around physical adjustments and surgery and pills   ....and it sounds like a drug addiction .....

"Female grad students and professors find the idea of earnestly engaging in normative expressions of feminised beauty to be inconceivable because they masculinise themselves in male dominated fields where femininity may be undervalued and hindersome to their progress; and also because of some 'I'm not like other girls' weird flex(and this is fair enough). But you could have also pointed out that they may be doing so(or rather, not doing so) for the same reasons as the female prisoners who perform incredible feets of ingenuity and resourcefulness just to wear makeup, as a way of expressing and cultivating a uniquely female identity - things that prison takes away from them - It could be possible that these academic women in male dominated fields may be rejecting normative expressions of femininity as a way of expressing a unique female identity in fields where femininised beauty is seen as frivolous. But you could have also suggested that the reason they don't conform is because they would rather find their self-worth through cultivating kindness, intelligence, and inner beauty(this may also be what femininity means for them). I am not sure why self-expression and cultivation were good reasons for choosing to conform to heteronormative beauty standards through the expression of feminised beauty but were not also presented as good reasons for choosing not to conform.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The word 'attractive' doesn't have to mean in a sexual sense. A well manicured lawn is more 'attractive' than an unmowed one full of weeds. It means being more comfortable around something, as opposed to finding something unpleasant. So making oneself more attractive doesn't mean you're specifically targeting a sexual partner, it means you're trying to be more pleasing-looking to everyone, including yourself. You say yourself that no amount of facts and logic and perceived injustice make you WANT to be beautiful any less, and that you need to forgive yourself for wanting to be beautiful. Why is that same forgiveness not afforded to those who, despite facts and logic and injustice, also want you (and  not just you but everyone) to be beautiful?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm a French transgirl of 2.5 years, and for me personally, having very low energy levels kind of forced me to develop a good self-image in the absence of make-up (too much effort to apply, WAY too much effort to research, buy, and resupply for). Having so little energy to devote to constructive activities is a reason why someone wouldn't wear much make-up, if at all.  I think it's very important to learn to love one's own face without make-up first. Of course, it helps to have an unconditional sense of self-worth, too. I'm aware it's not an option for everyone, I'm sorry, but a healthy 'natural' confidence is a great boost. Sure, my forehead is a little big, and I have a hair pattern that makes some people think I'm balding (I'm not, and luckily, my hairline has advanced a little), but nobody's perfect, basically. Trying to apply to ourselves the same kind of overlooking-of-flaws we apply to others is also great (having a trans girlfriend has helped me a lot with that, since we've had similar struggles).  I'm also 184 centimeters tall, and I'm pudgy, too, which is not the best combination, but I've learned to love even that. I can amuse myself with the idea that I dwarf even the average French man by 6-7 centimeters. Makes me feel like they're puny, and I'm powerful, in a way. Of course, with my body constitution, I should be toned and hardened like an amazon warrior, but I still need to work on that.   Sorry if none of that comment helped, I'm pretty rambly in general. I'm also aware that having a loving, supportive, incredibly sweet partner is a huge part of learning to love ourselves like they love us, and I know not everyone has someone like that yet, but don't give up. I used to be pretty desperate myself, and pretty fugly on top that. There's always hope somewhere.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"'That's what leftists do, we critique things...' What an appalling statement from someone claiming to be on the left. The left, the real left, not the idpol-neutered travesty it has become, did NOT just critique things. We created labor unions, organized strikes, demanded better conditions for workers and pushed for fairer representations in parliaments around the world (all of which was done first and foremost on the basis of class, and not in the name of irreconcialable identities). That's what the left did, what it's supposed to do instead of staging toothless protests about meaningless representation of marginalized groups in the American college campuses it's been more than happy to be cooped up into by capital. All of this virtous activism to be immediatley forgotten after the credentials are obtained, the privilege's been laundered and it's time to become another cog in the capitalist machine in 4 or 5 year's time.

"As a cis woman with body dysmorphic disorder i heavily relate to this video.  I've often felt the desire for surgery to feminize my features so that they might align themselves with my feminine identity; regardless of biological sex - in looking masculine despite being female, the dysphoria is still there.  I want to get surgery to alleviate the mental anguish looking in the mirror invokes in me, and trans women want the same; so is there really a difference between the motive? Is ffs truly just aesthetic vanity?  Also brings up the question of the societal implications behind the differences between body dysmorphic disorder, body dysphoria, and simply being unattractive.  I was told that in diagnosis for body dysmorphic disorder, your physical beauty doesn't matter; its the obsession you have around it.  And yet trans women who experience these same symptoms are instead told to change themselves.... the opposite of what cis women with bdd are told (don't get surgery because it doesn't fix your body image, etc.).  I just find it interesting that regardless of how often the rhetoric of 'beauty is on the inside!' Is spread, even by mental health professionals - the standards are still reinforced, albeit unconsciously.  We will always hold on to these traditional beauty standards, and those of us who are unattractive, will always have bdd unless we lie to ourselves, or get the surgery to become beautiful.

"Beauty is an important part of every culture. Denying it exists is a lie. Its a social construct? Yes. And all social constructs exist because they lead to actions performed by individuals of that society. Does beauty have to be a homogenous aspect of society? No. Because then you will have people hating themselves or hating others because they dont fit a specific mold. Do we all should be considered beautiful despite our attempts to follow certain standars of beauty? Thats the most intriguing question  Beauty isnt shallowness, beauty impacts societies on many levels and trivialize it or even reject with disgust the interest on beauty leaves a blank space on sociology, art, history, pschycology, and other areas where the human being tends to be the main subject of discussion","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I do think that there is a hidden research treasure with femininity as seen by trans women. Because I can see that these women still have a very male pov of what femininity is, probably because society and men presented it to them as such. And being perceived as male when younger, they did not have the experience of women being surrounded by each other and knowing about the difference of this mask and reality. Then again as cp already said in another video, trans women have even less freedom to 'pass' and the stakes of punishment if they don't is much higher. Yet, in trans women videos I noticed that they hold themselves very much against the male perfect women ideal. Although there are many more, even socially acceptable female stereotypes to choose from.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Listening to you speak, I'm becoming convinced that body dysmorphia is indeed a mental disorder, and should be treated as such - Instead of altering your physiology, we should be correcting the defective metal processes and/or underlying endocrinological problems.  The condition matches up perfectly with the textbook definition of when a mental state is a disorder - when it interferes with your ability to live a normal life.  There is nothing inherently wrong with getting your nose straightened, breast augmentation/reduction to match your frame, scars are not natural and often remind people of how they got them - that's all fine.  BUT when someone's mental well being is jeopardized because they can not accept  their physical appearance, that's a mental illness. In many parts of the world, people commit suicide as they can not accept how dismal their prospects are,  In South Korea and Japan, many *children* commit suicide when it becomes apparent they do not have what it takes to get highly prestigious positions.   Both body dysmorphia and situation depression leading to suicide are NOT sane, both are extreme, illogical(a/k/a insane) reactions to objective reality.  If people can not function in objective reality, that's a mental disorder.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Interesting, thanks for the explanations with the skull! Well done also for your honesty: I've known so many women who claimed they had not had surgery... when it was obvious this was the case! Or playing on words, like Botox is not surgery...  The end result is nice, but don't overdo it please. A couple of weeks ago, I saw a recent photograph of an actress I used to follow when she was in her 20s and 30s. She is now in her 50s. It was obvious she'd had surgery, but the outcome was nothing to write home about, so my first thought was that she'd been in an accident where she'd suffered injuries to her face... So maybe leave things as they are now? Plus, fear of ageing is usually fear of death. No amount of Botox or whatever is going to make you immortal. And instead of investing into creams and sprays and what not, invest into fresh vegetables. Check out Dr Pamela Popper: she looks good for her age, doesn't she?

"It would be really interesting to hear your opinion on the final section of Elizabeth Anderson's classic article 'What is the point of equality?' called 'The disabled, the ugly and other victims of bad luck'. There she discusses some of the questions you touch upon, for example if beauty is a welfare-right, considering the impact it can have on one's ability to participate in political society (think of the coupling of beauty, trustworthiness and political authority). She discusses both publicly subsidized plastic surgery on the one side, and combating beauty norms on the other. I find this problematic very hard: beauty is too fun and enjoyable to give up on, but it's also essentially unfair. Not everyone could be beautiful if anyone were to be at all, there must be heights and lows. Or perhaps your notion of style overcomes this dilemma.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Once you've studied enough faces, it's almost impossible. I have seen almost every configuration of features on a face at this point. There is a certain range that most people recognize as 'normal', but when you start turning someone's face to different angles you realize how far out of 'normal' most people are.

"24:00 you realized the problem but instead of confronting it you said, i should change the reasons why i think i should be beautiful.  You try to fool yourself that if you change the rationalizations as to why you want to look beautiful you would feel beautiful and have no shame about it. This is wrong and is still playing the same game, the endless game of trying to achieve something that you consider unachievable. This is why you always say to yourself if i fix this flaws i will be beautiful, and then you go and do it and it fixes nothing on your self esteem in the long term. I know you know this because you explain so in your video. (try to imagine you wanting money or power instead of beauty, you then feel like crap because you know you want money because of the status, and to try to live a life of luxury, do you think the solution is to fool yourself to try to want money for a more righteous cause? no because those are not your motivations).  So you should escape the wheel instead of trying to change the meaning of the wheel. Those female scholars you talk about do this in their own way, but it is not necessary to abandon ever trying to feel beautiful.  You have to see the wheel find the misery at the end, lose hope in the wheel and surrender completely to the lack of ultimate beauty and meaning, and then you will realize that it was you all along. You where holding the carrot and the stick, but you can just go and grab the carrot. I think therefore i am.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"TL;DR: Leftists misconstrue two entirely separate market economic models, but I do like your videos and I'm writing this so that your videos can be more accurate in the future ^-^  Now I'm a Voluntaryist (AnCap) and i agree with quite a few things you talk about in this video; my main hang-up however is when you mention at 25:00 that leftists are ''Finely tuned detectors of Capitalism run amok''. Now the issue I have with this is due in part to a misunderstanding of the definition of Capitalism. Capitalism necessitates that any trade/transaction is Voluntary. But considering the market is Regulated, we do not have a Capitalist Market Economy. Capitalism requires the market economy to be Laissez Faire by default. We currently live and act in a Crony-Capitalist Market Economy (Corporatocracy/Corporatism) where the rich can buy power off the government in order to regulate the market in their favour- which is a breach of human rights. The fact that they are able to do this and not us as individuals is abhorrent and we Voluntaryists will 100% agree with you on that point.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Rossy de Palma is an Spanish actress that is really known for her weird beauty. She has a prominent nose, weird teeth and look like... really big. I dont know if she've ever had plplastic surgery but its her personality that really catches the eye. I don't consider myself as a really handsome guy and somedays i kindda feel shitty about how i look.... But it's the attitude that really catches the atention. I watch your channel because i love how you see things. Don't get me wrong... it's not like 'i agree with everything you say because it's you who is saying it'. I really like the thought process you put in all your work. Remember that all you are phisically now will wither within a few years. But who you are and what you do will last you a life time.

"Okay can we stop with this misunderstanding abt east asian ppl and cosmetic surgery-- the desire to have double eyelid surgeries and rhinoplasties are not the result of 'wanting to look white--' if you look at any kpop celebrity or other icon of korean beauty, you might notics they do not look 'white' or uphold very many Eurocentric beauty standards by any stretch. They are seeking to uphold a different (yes still problematic af bc its a beauty standard most ppl cannot attain) beauty standard, which is more pixy like, with a small face with a petite pointed chin, large (usually double lidded eyes) and a narrow nose, but no one ever thinks abt the overall picture do they. Yes, the features they are seeking are more typical of caucasian faces, but the majority of east asians, by getting these surgeries, are not trying to look like those of european descent-- they are trying to look like pretty asians. There is a great podcast episode from 99pi URL that explains this in great depth. Listen to that before u go ranting abt how much more abt cosmetic surgery than i do.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm not the sort to sugarcoat, life's too short to not say what you think in most cases.   I have been watching a while now, Natalie, around the time you posted your Incels video (so after you began identifying as a transgender woman instead of a transvestite man) but I did watch pretty much all your older videos, in most of which you're still a man, because I truly like your content; I find it witty and entertaining while informative on the whole trans thing (as I'm a straight cis man) and I agree a great deal with your liberal eco-socialist politics.   When I first saw you I thought you were hot but it did cross my mind as to whether you were trans (and later in he video you said you were) so while you were attractive to me, someone who only finds women attractive, you technically didn't 'pass.'  However I did notice over the course of your videos since, you getting progressively more feminine and attractive (and generally I have found following your gender transition an interesting story from medical, sociological and human interest perspectives.)  But when I started playing this one I was like 'still getting more lady like and beautiful, good for her, I don't think I'd suspect she might be transgender now' and then you were like 'I had face surgery!'  So while subtle, the surgery has made a difference in your so-called passability and increased it to the sort of level you've been looking for. Congratulations! Though, like I said, you had already become sexy to many straight men (I know I'm not the only one) by that time anyway.  I said what I said at the start so you'd know this isn't sycophantic fan gushing. I hate that shit. I'm a socialist who lives in a country run by sycophants to the capitalist establishment of another country that occupies mine and spent centuries trying to erase our culture and language while exploiting our people and environment to enrich themselves. So sycophancy annoys me and so I wouldn't compliment you so (I hope it comes across that way) without meaning it.  My point is basically well done for being yourself despite the challenges and don't give yourself such a hard time about whether you're beautiful and whether you should want to be (most of us get those worries and change our bodies in some way, such as me spending years putting on muscle at the gym, which I'm sure was less painful than getting my face reconstructed.)  Keep up the good work. I look forward to more.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I love your dress. :)  Regarding the topic, personally I am happy with myself without make-up most of the time, and I feel like a lot of fellow female academics are the same. It doesn't have to be about presenting more masculine to fit in, or taking refuge in being 'weird' (I don't actually think it's weird to not wear make-up). It is about presenting however I want, about literally not caring - and not caring feels *great.*  The occasional times I do care tend to be when I'm surrounded by women who've done amazing things with their make-up skills, which I admire, and I feel like I'm letting down the team by not making the same effort (due to being essentially lazy and valuing the time it would take to glam up my appearance more than I'd value a glam appearance).  I do feel, to a certain extent, being happy with my non-made-up appearance might be a bit privileged or something, but it's not like said appearance is so amazing (more like average). I think the real privilege is having an upbringing where I wasn't really told my value depended on my appearance, to the extent that I can largely ignore social and advertising messages to the contrary. (On the other hand, feeling like my value depends on how well I do academically is a distortion I *do* struggle with, and I very much admire you forging your own path in that respect rather than letting academia dictate your value.)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I often catch myself thinking that I don't deserve some people in my life because they're far more attractive than me (not only crushes, also friends).  I really do need to forgive myself for seeking beauty. And I need to stop thinking of myself as ugly.

Fucking lol men are men no matter what they dress up as, they'll always get priority over women.   Women in prison care about makeup because they've learned their lesson very well. If you're ugly you're worthless. You're not a woman if you're ugly, you're not even a human being.   You're not having 'fun' because beauty isn't a Hollywood movie. It's literally about constantly searching for flaws and trying to 'fix' them, even though it's futile since you can't fight against time. Why do you think women are more neurotic then men? They're told they're never good enough and must be vigilant to 'stay young & pretty'. It's a losing battle.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've been thinking about my appearance lately. I was relatively good looking (for a nerd). But last year I had a baby so my body has been going through a shit show of changes for over a year. 9 mo to make the baby, and so far 9mos of recovery. I've been asked if I was pregnant twice since my baby was born. One of those gentle men told me 'don't go getting offended now' not a word of apology. I'm also in a very male dominated field. It is not unusual for me to go weeks without having a meeting with a single other woman in attendance. I am the only woman in my seating area. When I first started in my field I tried to fit in and dressed as masculine as I could, but when I was pregnant, it was impossible to fit in. Can't really make pregnancy seem masculine. I started dressing more feminine and wearing dresses to work. I realized I really liked it, and have continued to wear almost exclusively dresses. It's like my own professional middle finger to expectation that to be good I have to be a man. I still don't wear make up, mostly because I don't know how. But I really enjoy rocking my floral patern flowy dresses around an office full of khaki pants.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Been a fan of your stuff for a good while, but idk, one thing that does kind of strike out to me particularly in the recent videos is the amount of glorification of aesthetics. In your video about aesthetics, you say that it's the era of aesthetics rather than logic; so, in that sense, relying on aesthetics to reach an audience could be justified (but I doubt there's really audience being reached that did not already agree with you, so therefore - moot point). But having the aesthetics rely on ever increasing amounts of makeup, more and more costumes, wigs, surgery, etc, is basically a privilege given by imperialist capitalism (yeah, that's a very radcool phrase, but still). You can't honestly be seriously taken as standing against consumerism, capitalism, privilege, or believing in inner beauty, when you yourself gleefully dive into things provided to you by consumerism, capitalism and your privilege.  In this video, yeah, you bring this up yourself kind of towards the end, but saying one thing and doing the opposite doesn't really mean much. I'm not sure you're being fully intellectually honest anymore. Alas, I also don't believe, for a moment, that you'll really going to find an escape from your depression and anxieties by building your own fairytale castle to live in.  I'm not sure if I recognize this style of leftism as what's leftism to me. Left is about opposing hierarchies. Opposing transphobia, homophobia, etc, is naturally leftist, as discrimination is a form of hierarchization. But focusing excessively on beauty, aesthetics, consumption, hedonism, are also hierarchical things. Whole concept of beauty standards is a form of hierarchy. Excessive consumption (of which clothes, makeup, etc, make by far the largest part) is the largest problem we have stemming from capitalism. Here you appear to basically defend consumption in regards of one's outer beauty (a major driving point of consumerism, as established prior).  I also can't really agree with your idea that women are disposed to do make-up primarily due to their desire for self-expression. I come from a very different background than you no doubt, but women in my family and my life don't normally wear make-up except when going out. You might be right that the make-up isn't primarily used to attract fuckable mates, but that doesn't mean it still wasn't often used for the wrong reasons. I think it's actually pretty naive to believe that make-up and surgery is primarily gotten to promote one's own personal style. A lot of people use it just to fit in and to feel better about themselves. Why do they need to feel better about themselves by using make-up though? Because everyone else is using it and thus forcing even those, who wouldn't want to, to use it if they want to fit in. Our society's ever-increasing focus on supposed individuality (that's not really individuality, it's just marketed individuality) is not making anyone happier. It's making people worse off. Women in American prisons trade sex to get make-up and know what else is widespread in American prisons? Mental health issues. 2/3 of American women in prisons have a history with mental health issues. And I fucking guarantee that it's not because it's hard to get make-up. However I do suspect that our excessive concern about our appearances is very much linked to increased stress levels, anxiety and thus, mental health issues.  Aesthetically, you're super awesome though. Ironically enough.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I was just thinking about the 'I thought surgery would change my self image' thing this morning.  I think part of the reason some trans-people commit suicide or struggle with a deepening depression following gender-confirmation surgery is because they get the idea that the surgery will 'fix them', and when it doesn't they can't see any end or hope.  I mean, if changing everything about themselves via a difficult and painful surgery or series of surgeries doesn't make them happy, then they have to feel like nothing will.  Of course, I still believe that the outside forces play a larger factor, but that feeling that surgery can make you happy must be part of it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"As a lesbian... yeah this might be the least easy to understand video of yours so far. I think this really is true... I like women, I am one... And I really find almost everything about women attractive, including myself, the one things I don't like is too much acne and that's all I guess, just it being healthy, not even wrinkles matter. :v. I do make up sometimes but it feels like a chore.... it's boring and I only do it sometimes because a look requires it or there will be photos taken and I want to look 'proper'. Moreover, I'm more attracted to feminine women or futches, hardly every to butches, yet don't mind dark circles or whatever that make up is supposed to cover up. Also I feel like my definition of 'feminine' might be kinda untraditional... What I'm looking for is the way you behave, grace is something I consider a very feminine attribute. Wide shoulders, flat chest, short hair, it's all fine, you just need to have that air and they way you style yourself to be feminine so also this video is weird cause I've always seen you as very feminine, with the plastic surgery or not. Really not much has changed in my view of you despite, of course seeing different features but the air about you is the same - extremely feminine. Also I'm sorry if you'll actually read this rambling, I don't know where I'm going with this anymore uhhh.... I mostly started to write it cause I'm procrastinating hahah, yeah so in conclusion - you're great and I, personally, find you very attractive, but found myself completely unable to relate to anything in this video, that's all :D. Okay.... tho the part about looking at women and dying inside instead of doing anything.... very true,.... that was relatable </3.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I am studying biology as a woman, who wears a full face of makeup and loves dresses and skirts and trendy things... I definitely get judged for it & not taken seriously. I have to prove myself in every lab to show people I deserve to be there. And I know for a fact this is happening, it's not just a feeling. I had someone in a class of mine tell a mutual friend they just 'kind of assumed' that I was 'pretty dumb' until I said something in class and the professor said it was a good comment... This person actually happened to be a TA in another class I was taking at the time.  I was so hurt by that and seriously considered changing the way I present myself in class. I didn't... but I can't pretend I didn't solely because of a 'fuck-you I'll wear this fuchsia ombre lip AND you'll respect me' empowered feeling. It was maybe 30% that... but 70% that I rely on those things to feel beautiful and feeling beautiful is WAY to fucking important to me for health. I mean fuck, I struggle with an eating disorder, clearly being beautiful takes up too much of my headspace, I KNOW that.   And that does kind of make me stupid, I guess. At least according to a lot of people, and almost definitely according to the person who thought I was 'dumb' in the first place, because I'm using precious brain space to think about better ways to apply lipliner instead of to change the world or whatever the fuck they think they're doing. So it doesn't really matter what I know about prenatal phthalate exposure or whatever... I'm stupid anyways. Or at least frivolous. I also have a lot of other frivolous, non-academic interests, though, I love to bake, I love to embroider and crotchet, I love running and swimming, I have never been made to feel that any of those things erode my critical thinking ability.

I think most people feel that way, we see our own faces too often. I think there was some science-y thing said about how our brains overcorrect our own faces when we look at it and also your face is flipped in the mirror, which is why looking at photographs of yourself or videos feels really weird. edit: I'm now at the part of the video where you have no makeup on and my caveman brain has finally adjusted - wow <3 so pretty!

"Wow the quality of the video is amazing as always! Thank you so much for sharing your feelings and experiences in such an honest way. I admire your style and the unique style of your videos.  You said that you want to be beautiful and at the same time that it's hard for you to tell how you look. I sometimes also feel this way. Maybe it is because we are not able to see ourselves through other people eyes?and we just see ourselves as we are, whereas beauty is subjective characteristic. And there is no absolute beauty? And these standards are only the constructions by society, associated with power, true. But it is not very defined characteristics, as all the other notions that we invented as humanity. throughout the history what was considered beautiful changed, what was associated with femininity and masculinity changed. Even now when we have conventional media inspired beauty standards (especially for women), which are extremely unobtainable and controversial, by the way, different people have their own perceptions of beauty. And sometimes (at least for me) whether I consider someone beautiful is not based of 'are they conventional standard of beauty for their gender'. It isn't. It's more like the whole appearance - the looks, yes, but also their charisma, how and what they talk about, their unique sense of humor, their smarts, as you said THEIR STYLE, yes. So, I personally don't think that your fans want to flatter you or exaggerate when they say 'you're beautiful', I think they mean it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

What happens to us and around us is not inherently good or bad, what matters is how we perceive it.

"First of all, Natalie looks amazing!  Also, I'm just like everyone else, obsessed and personally failing at being beautiful, but I just wanted to add a little input from the perspective of different cultures. There's beauty and there's beauty.    I've lived in Europe, the UK and often stayed in the US. When I lived in the UK and stayed in the US I felt constantly ugly and like beauty was hard work. I waxed, got manicures and pedicures, used fake eyelashes and felt like a dumpling if I wasn't wearing self-tanner. That is because that was the beauty standard in those places, and everyone rigorously followed it and shamed those that didn't. It felt impossible to keep up and depressed me.    But when I moved to mainland Europe I got a real shock. The first time I went out with my new friends in a skin-tight dress, heels and fake eyelashes I felt like high-class sex worker. All the girls around me wore jeans, t-shirts, sneakers and a bit of mascara. I'm not saying mainland Europe isn't cis, white and able-bodied worshipping, but the beauty standards here are MUCH easier to achieve, so I feel pretty 3 times a month rather than never.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I m a girl that puts on makeup less than 10 times a year but as someone who spends up to 60 hours painting pixel perfect cartoon skin it can sometimes freak me out to look in the mirror and see the tiniest imperfections, yes it absolutely matters what your eye gets used to :D! But I see you at your most beautiful when you laugh sitting at the piano or when you leave those takes in the final video, where you have truely let go for a little split second. Not that I don't enjoy your performance, it sure keeps me comming back to your videos! But I noticed those little moments are really stuck vividly in my brain like moments I have shared with a friend or a loved one. Also the humor that comes from YOUR face combined with those asymmetrical funky mouth 'jerks' and raised eyebrows is astonishing and it is enhanced exactly because you are beautiful. I might speak from an artists perspective, but I feel like the majority of people picks up on this stuff, maybe without beeing able to point to it and see it as the genuine source of your charms. And you add so much extra on top! Another thing that stuck with me is when you once said you actually liked your voice, that sparked some joy here :D Hope you can say the same thing about all of you one day!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I've also started sharing images of myself in the name of creating representation as a proudly disabled human #DisabledAF  , but I'd be lying if I said that didn't fuck with me. What you said about not being hyper critical re: other people, but then being absurdly hyper critical to yourself is fucking relatable.

But when I actually put effort into my appearance and go to class....there seems to be this tension like people think i'm some stuck-up vacuous shallow person.

"I am neither a fan nor a hater - this is my first ContraPoints video. You look fine. It's hard to be '''beautiful'''. In fact, there is only like one or two females I personally find totally beautiful in the whole wide world. One is my first love and the other changes all the time. With both it's painfully obvious that it's completely subjective to me. But I don't really seek this elusive perfection of beauty, I think. So called flaws can be very attractive, especially if the person 'owns them', so to speak. There was this one gal in my life who was so aware of her flaws and so happy with them that I still can't decide if I strongly loved or hated her. She was a strong presence. It's up for debate if you look '''beautiful''', but I think you look interesting and charismatic and like you have an actual personality. And forgive me if using the following quote has some implications that I did not intend for, but 'personality goes a long way'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hello. Maybe women keep wearing makeup even when no men are around just because wearing some has become such a daily routine that it got linked to the positive feeling of wearing something. I know i feel vulnerable and clumsy when I'm naked outside a shower even if l am positively alone (so,underwears are not anymore solely to keep my privates private, yet, are not a channel of expression either, just a mean to avoid a habits induced weird feeling). Plus, not wearing/wearing make up is going to be interpreted, not only by men, but by everyone, including other inmates anyway. Jugement probably leads to tougher status realted situations in there... The self expression part falls, I think, more in the realm of the side effect compared to the others , since anything that you do yourself is revealing some of you anyway.

"i think Natalie kinda broaches this by bringing up style and how it's a way around conventional beauty standards (and i'm also fully aware that she's to some extent joking by calling grad students beckys so don't come for me), but i still think its important to go beyond the not like other girls/femme=frivolous stereotypes when it comes to women who don't wear make up. as a woman who wore make up everyday (one who's not white) it took me YEARS to finally be ok exiting my house with a bare face (and finding a 'style' that suits me has definitely helped with this) but I made the effort because i was tired, broke, lacked self-esteem, etc. and (frankly) could think of better things to do with my time in this 'imperialist white supremacist capitalist patriarchy' we call home. i think its important to remember that as much as people might be wearing make up for themselves, they might be choosing not to for the same reason. one of the side effects of femme=frivolous is that make-up isn't seen as a form of labor or effort. maybe (as well as being special beckys) those grad students are burnt out and have two classes to teach in the morning and a paper due the next? you know? ok i'm done   (also that pikachu/brain clip made my day)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm gonna armchair a lot of this, so youtube is the perfect place. I think altering your appearance, whether through diet, exercise, or care products, is mostly for self-confidence. It's when you push your appearance out to society (through visiting social places or engaging in social media) that you search for validation to reaffirm that self-confidence. By engaging with media that constantly criticizes your appearance without factoring in your appearance, you're constantly weakening your own self-confidence, all so you can be sold back that confidence through products.    What I want to get is beyond all that and say, Contra, if you're having a bad day, try again tomorrow. It could be better. If you're having a bad week, take a break from some seeking of validation and focus on your own happiness and self-confidence. I hope you go out in the world and experience marvels of humanity. You contribute a lot to the mental health of people that want to make sense of the world, and plenty of us want you to be the best you can be.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Insofar as I can tell, this video was 3/4 of a Nietzsche ubermench's (or uberfrau? Google translate?) transformation: to acknowledge the lack of inherent worth in societal value judgements, to be cradled in nihilism for a spell, and to rise up  with your own set of value judgements. The missing quarter appears to be that one may see it as a failure if, after all of this, the resulting set of value judgement trends toward one's society's.   To be independant is not to be in opposition (notwithstanding what the 4th of July mythically stands for in the US). Just because society values oxygen breathing (maybe? I don't know anymore with the whole climate change situation) doesn't make one's valuation of oxygen breathing slave to the society. An extreme example, but if you repeat the exercise with more contentious non-essential things, you may find similar outcomes; Natalie certainly has, whether she realizes it or not.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think the issue lies more in the fact that you have to pay for the surgery more than the surgery in itself. The problem lies in the fact that not all people are going to be able to afford surgery, which creates a pretty prominent line between those who can and cant. To not address that we have a set beauty standard in which we either subconsciously or consciously want to achieve is in my opinion a bit naive. If we fall into the temptation of changing our appearance we have even more people to compare ourselves to. Which leads us to being more likely to feed into the system that discriminates us based on the way we look, and take advantage of our insecurities. Of course its ok to want to be beautiful, the problem is that we have a system that tells us that we are ugly as we are, that we have problems that HAVE to be changed for us to be accepted by society. So i won't criticize you on your decision on feminization because i see were you come from. We are all a product of the culture of our time and we can only hope for it to change for the better in the future.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I'm still affected by this draw to be appropriately, femininely attractive, and I'm still affected by the shame of /not being the same-- even though I don't want to be, and have never wanted to be, pretty in that way.

I'm not flattering when I say you look like a beautiful woman, even more so post surgery.  But now might be the time to do therapy because, frankly, you need it more than any further surgeries.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I don't really care about these things, but if we're talking about skulls and your Ramus definitely isn't at a right angle and it appears male, your Palate protrudes from your face and its general size gives away that your skull grew with testosterone, and there is no way to change that without essentially shrinking your head, for the Palate not to be out of relation, your orbits are too wide and too squarish for a female skull, you'll probably need to have them changed, because they weren't very well shaped even when you were a man, but now they just appear odd, like giant craters, the body of your Sternum is too large in relation to your Manubrium, your bones are also much longer and denser because they grew with tons of testosterone.   I'd say cosmetic surgery makes more sense with cis people, because all the basic sex characteristics of the skeleton are in order it's really just about shaving off some bone or putting in some implants with add a few millimeters. With trans-people I understand the desire for surgery is much greater, but the needed changes are much more severe, especially for mtf because what you are trying to do is essentially shrinking the skull and underdevelop the already developed skeletal features, while ftm you can put a jawline in, have them grow a beard and you're essentially golden, use some more implants for whatever you can think off, but no one will say that man is a woman because of an underdeveloped Inion, while a developed Inion will change the roundish appearance of the external Occipital protuberance, break the soft look of the skull contour in general, and give you that eerie feeling of talking to a man in a dress.   I like ContraPoints, but I cannot stand these disingenuous positive comments, your brain is pretty quick to say, I'd smash or I wouldn't smash and man or woman, and certain skeletal features just give that away. Writing a overly positive comment, which is either written by A someone who doesn't practice sexual selection for people whom they admire or B someone just straight up lying, while their brain tells them 'that's a male skull' and their moral conviction tells them 'if you don't say she's a beautiful woman with an extremely delicate and small skull you're a bigot'. Either way you're essentially doing the same thing haters are doing by gaslighting the person whom you are pretending to critique.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Also, mainstream media may have one concept of beauty and shove their models based on that onto you... but you can go out of your way to search for other beautiful people. Look at all the old paintings full or large/fat people. Or media from around the world with (hopefully) not just white people. Or Judi Dench and never worry about age ever again.

"Am I a delusional optimist for thinking that social media and the way content creators can use their platforms so readily is a key to deconstructing those standards? Like magazines and tv would only push whatever image they wanted onto us but now we can share ourselves as we are. We can organise days to showcase hashtags of blackout or transisbeautiful etc- but then I guess the flip side to that is the homogenising impact of social media where you can quantify what is considered the most liked. And I'm not even immune to that, if I get 500 likes on one Instagram picture but can't crack 200 on another I assume there's something wrong with the way I look in one and something amazing and therefore valid in the other one. This is all something I blame on reading Dorian Gray in my teens and concluding that my youthful appearance was both a power and a currency who's value was decided by how much other people liked it.

"This is an amazing essay by disability activist Mia Mingus which might be a good read. She reframes ugliness as magnificence:   'The magnificence of a body that shakes, spills out, takes up space, needs help, moseys, slinks, limps, drools, rocks, curls over on itself.  The magnificence of a body that doesn't get to choose when to go to the bathroom, let alone which bathroom to use.  A body that doesn't get to choose what to wear in the morning, what hairstyle to sport, how they're going to move or stand, or what time they're going to bed.  The magnificence of bodies that have been coded, not just undesirable and ugly, but un-human.  The magnificence of bodies that are understanding gender in far more complex ways than I could explain in an hour.  Moving beyond a politic of desirability to loving the ugly.  Respecting Ugly for how it has shaped us and been exiled. Seeing its power and magic, seeing the reasons it has been feared. Seeing it for what it is: some of our greatest strength.'   I have come to find these things beautiful, through experience, just as I slowly came to find female body hair beautiful, on myself and other people, through getting used to it, and whatever other mysterious processes were at work. I have also come to find value in what I find ugly, without having to reframe it as beautiful. Of course, I still have all the hangups and judgements about my own appearance, I'm not over that and never will be, but I can honestly say that I think in 'moving towards the ugly', something fundamental has shifted for me, which is beyond which politics I want to perform and what makes sense to me in theory...

"MY dysphoria is mostly tied to outside pressure. I do have some body dysphoria ever since I hit puberty, but just hiding those features helps - it's only frustrating coz it takes active effort. However, my desire to transition at all is mostly coming from other people, both strangers and family alike, not seeing me as what I am. I'm mostly happy with how I look, but no matter how I present myself, every once a while I still get reminded by someone that they seem me as the one gender I never identified as.  As a result I'm just hyper aware of what I look like when ever I'm outside with people around. At worst I have this irrational constant nagging in my head that everyone is looking at me and sees a gender I am not. I'm also nonbinary, so if ppl were not immediately defaulting to the wrong one I'd be pretty content. I just don't think that has ever happened. I'm only ever been gendered correctly online where nobody knows who I am or what I look like.  If people would have to guess and get it wrong, I'd sill feel crappy tbh. It's how I realized I wasn't just nonbinary or agender like I previously identidied as. Out of the options of man, woman or ambiguous, the only one that made me want to dig a hole and die in it every time was also the only one ppl ever saw. My language has no gendered pronouns so it's not constant, but it happens when people refer to me wrong in conversations and I generally don't feel like it's worth it to correct vast majority of them. I developed anxiety due to the combined effects my dysphoria and the pressure over becoming more conscious of how I'm seen by others.  So just telling me to be happy with how I look is not really helpful. I am mostly content with how I look, but it does not change how people react to me and my appearance on a daily basis. A social change of that level is not gonna happen overnight either, so working to abolish gender expectations is hardly comforting either.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a cis woman, this was really interesting! I struggled a lot with beauty standards as a child and throughout my teenage years, but as a young adolescent, I think I found a healthy balance. I only started to love my own body, when I made the choice to love it not for its beauty, but for its strength and ability to make me happy. Years after that, I found myself beautiful for the first time. Wearing make-up is a very rare thing for me, and often makes me feel estranged from myself.   Of course, I had the privilege of being born cis. I didn't have to convince anyone of my femininity, I only had to deal with people who told me I was doing it 'wrong'.  To me, by letting go of beauty as my self-defining factor, I became happier with who I am.

"Pretty sure the skin colour thing has gone/is going the other way in the UK, darker tanned skin is 100% more popular and considered more aesthetically pleasing to the point where I have a few ethnically white friends who are consistently darker than some of my friends who are from ethnically African and Middle Eastern backgrounds.   I'd say if you went on a night out in Manchester (like I did last weekend) and you see a big group of girls (12+) 1 or 2 will be definitely identifiable as an ethnicity the others will be a range of skin and hair tones/textures and you've basically got no chance of guessing their race if you were put on the spot.  Ultimately I think this is pretty positive as it's definitely influenced a lot of my 'lads'. When we were teenagers some of them would have definitely made a point out of someone else's race or background, maybe not in explicitly negative terms but certainly in a ignorant way. This just does not happen anymore about anything and I have a feeling it's because,in part, those beauty standards have changed (obviously they've also matured/grown up as well)   I can only speak from personal experience and understand that everyone has a different perspective on this issue so by no means is this meant to represent anything other than my opinion.

"I have a feeling you read every single comment on here.  Loved the video! I've also found myself in this predicament. Whenever I tell people that I want to have facial feminization surgery, their knee-jerk reaction is that my face looks fine and I can pass without it. While I know intellectually that my face is androgynous and it testosterone could've done me a lot worse, I still feel like I need to change it and personally I think it's a matter of gender dysphoria not necessarily being 100% rational rather than society influencing the way I view the perfect archetype of womanhood.  Ironically this is coming from the same person who has no sense of style, relies solely on other people's perception of what it means to be beautiful and feminine and is the most gender conforming woman ever.  So yeah.. might be a mix between those. But the lines are so blurry like you said! If there's one thing I've learned it's that no matter how far you are into your transition or how gorgeous you look, The Darkness will still be there.   I guess the only thing you can do is to keep it at bay by doing whatever you feel like doing to feel beautiful, female and feminine while also going deeper than your face and challenging those pesky psychological issues.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"While they don't usually wear makeup, I notice women in academia etc almost universally have long hair, lipstick, and earrings. They don't do alot, but they always do something. I think the whole makeup thing for women is a result of a natural hive mind and beauty standards are more along the line of a membership card. Transwomen pursue beauty because of a drive away from their male reality which is mixed with a natural desire for what makes a woman beautiful; they embody that which they want as opposed to cis men who pursue and surround themselves with what they want. Transwomen embody it internally, cis men obtain it externally. I think once you put to rest your desire for the aspects of the female that you simply cannot have, you will be satisfied with what you do have. Well done on the surgery btw.

"It sorta stuck me when Natalie talked about bone structure to fit the bouncy 5'2 bio-girl. Because as a bouncy 5'2 (ok 5'1) cis girl I have always had a less feminine facial structure than her. I was probably only 12 when I first noticed that many of my facial features would be considered attractive on a man but not on me; pronounced brow, defined square jaw and chin. I also at the time had more body hair than 90% of guys my age. I still at 20 have more body hair than a lot of guys and basically every girl I've ever met. But the parts of myself that I've always disliked were the parts that make me look feminine, rather than masculine, being my height and my breast size. I like my face, and my body hair, and my muscles, as long as they aren't compared to other women. So I almost want to get away from everything that causes me to be compared to them by making myself more masculine rather than taking away those things to make myself more feminine. If it were acceptable for cis women to get top surgery for non medically nessesarily reasons I would consider it. At the same time I am definitely still a cis girl.   Ain't gender expression fun, guys?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"26:40 - hell yeah, more diversity in 'conventional beauty' is something any thinking cis-male would want. The more pretty girls, the better! WARNING: PERSONAL OPINION IF YOU READ MORE      My controversial opinions on Contra's surgery:  tbh Natalie, I feel you looked more feminine/better with your previous face, at least from the front. The new face seems, for lack of a better word, plastic... but maybe it's just the makeup. I guess the nosejob is 'good' in that it does make you look more like someone destined to become a soccer mom, but again, IMO, you looked better and more feminine before. Although, your current face does look more... chill, I guess? You seem like you're someone who'd be decent to hang out with, but needs to be kept at friend distance because of deep-lying issues that make things awkward if you get too close. It was opposite previously, someone who'd be awkward to shallowly hang out with but a top-notch conversationalist.  Oh, and you've been beautiful since you started trying to be. The moment I learned you were transitioning, you were already most of the way there and had already made yourself look beautiful...","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"9:54 I'm pretty sure the main explanation is simpler than a not-like-other-girls thing.  For trans women, make-up can feel more like an opportunity - after years of the closet and dysphoria, coming into play as a means of alleviating it. cis women are a bit more likely to be sick of it because it's been forced on them from a young age. So they're just more likely to make use of an environment where there's less of an expectation to wear it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Different strokes for different folk. I personally find more beauty in those academic ladies that don't wear make up. I'm not attracted to glam in any way, in fact I would classify myself as... Um, anti-glam? glamphobic? Critical of Glamification?    Fake nails, eyelashes, heels, excessive jewelry, tattoos, piercings or any kind of cosmetic surgery are things that not only I consider unpleasant but have a direct aversion to. Of course I believe in anyone's fundamental freedom to do as they please with their appearance but it is not something that I would encourage, support or validate in any way.   Hence my big roadblock with glamorous transexuals, I find this type of entitlement towards beauty to be quite reprehensible on anyone regardless of gender, I do see it as simple vanity. And I feel very strongly about that...

I'm a cis woman in my 30s and I've never worn makeup on a regular basis. I find that now, for the first time, I have more financial means to explore using makeup, and I am struck by the desire to do so.  So many things that you touch on this video play into this desire and I have been questioning my own motivations.  Is it valid to suddenly want to put time, effort, and money into what is essentially a corporate sand trap that thrives on people feeling bad about how they look, and directs them to pour resources into their appearance rather than into other things? How much of this desire to participate in beauty culture comes from wanting to explore artistic creativity and style, and how much is it wanting to protect my aging self from criticism amidst an ocean of messages that an old women are pathetic and dismissable?  Can I trust my own feelings and reactions towards these things?  Is it SHalLoW? Even if it is shallow, is it wrong to pass that judgement on it? Can I just enjoy things without digging deeper or is that irresponsible? In full honesty, I don't think I can earnestly and accurately pick apart even my own motivations; society's influence runs too deep.  Basically the realization that I've come to, is that conventional beauty IS privilege.  Some people, more than others, have effortless access to this privilege.  Regardless of my conscious motivations, if I start to wear makeup, I will be actively accessing that privilege.  I think this applies to anyone who tries to enhance their appearance in order to align more closely with societal standards for beauty--the desire to access more privilege is folded in.  And that's...understandable?  Certainly it is understandable for trans women to use tools like makeup to access as much cis-passing privilege as they can, since that has tangible consequences for their safety and happiness.  In general, it is understandable to want to be rewarded for your appearance by the world at large, if that is within your ability. I am certainly extremely privileged to be able to be treated humanely and civilly without wearing makeup (were this not the case, I surely would have been using it a lot sooner), but there is no question that wearing it would bring with it a whole new set of experiences and opportunities, both good and bad.  I think it's valid to be curious about that.  But I also think at least for me, it's important to be aware that accessing privilege is what I'm doing when I strive to be more 'beautiful', and to carry that awareness when interpreting the reactions and feedback I get.  This video was so validating in the idea that 'beauty is complicated'.  It is not simply shallowness, self-expression, a hobby, or a tool.  You cannot simply make an expression decision without it having rippling implications for your life.  And honestly that's...really annoying.  But, all that aside, I want to say thank you for the videos you make, every single one is a masterpiece <3","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Natalie, as usual, made me think about my own experiences with beauty and cosmetics in relation to my own transition.  My personal expression of beauty is influenced by western ideals and capitalist fuckery, but I still enjoy wearing makeup because it makes me more visually appealing and more importantly, it makes me feel pretty. It gives me an emotional boost and allows me to feel closer to the traditional feminine aesthetic.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Fwiw, the left is definitely NOT a fine-tuned critiquer of ableism. They do not give a flying shit about ableism. It's always just added onto the list when people list '-isms', and it's considered controversial because while being e.g. not white is not intrinsically bad, being disabled IS intrinsically bad (sans social model of disability), therefore it's right to -ism against it (because nowadays '-ism', to overzealous white queer SJW millenials, is more 'unfair preference/affiliation' than 'outright physical harm and exclusion'). I can't remember the last time I actually saw something harming or obstructing disabled people (not, like, abstractly, but like 'Hey if I ask if there are stairs into the LeftFest 2019 Undisclosed Secret Venue could someone try to find out before I travel 4 hours to get there with a wheelchair, and not be mad that I asked?'). (Note: I'm not a chair user, it's just an example. I am disabled though and my bf is a chair user so I hear the complaints.) I understand that stuff is not going to be physically accessible for minorities and I accept it, I just want some basal acceptance that I'm not going to physically harm myself on purpose and that that's rational self-interest.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I relate to this video a lot. I don't wear makeup, mostly by virtue of never having started so I have no clue what I'm doing, but every once in a while the thought crosses my mind and I immediately shut it down out of that fear of looking like I'm trying. I found your admittance to want to be beautiful really sort of helpful for myself, since I tend to feel bad about wanting the same thing. Maybe I'll finally pick up some eyeshadow and learn what toners actually do!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Girl, you look amazing! I always loved dressing up, looking sharp and stylish but I've been told that it is a distraction because it keeps the focus away from my work (especially when I'm presenting) and puts the main focus on my body, which is something I don't want. Since I, unfortunately, cannot change the mind of others, I have to tone down my wish to look and feel glamorous in order to work in peace. My workplace doesn't allow me to stand out and it's best for me to 'blend in' with everyone else in order to present a coherent image of the company I work for rather than expressing my individuality. Nevertheless, I think it is amazing that you are able to express yourself in that way and I strongly believe that all women can benefit from women like you, who show that we can have it both: intellect and beauty. You are not only able to use your looks to highlight your points but you also perfected it and I admire you for that!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Look, I don't know how to say this tactfully, but if you really think your fans say that you're beautiful or that you pass perfectly because they just want to flatter you, then you really need to at least think about your stance on psychiatrists again, because you might need therapy for that level of insecurity.  Like, I don't know who you're measuring yourself against, but if it's someone like Ariana Grande (is she someone people consider a standard for femininity or beauty these days?), then you're never going to look like her, because 1) not even Ariana Grande looks like Ariana Grande most of the time and 2) you have entirely the wrong body type for that.  But let me tell you a secret, my second celebrity crush ever was Celine Dion back in the 90s (so in her late 20s-early 30s), and you already looked almost exactly like her before your surgery. In fact, my first crush was Winona Ryder, and looking at her pictures from when she was around 30, you don't look all that different from her either. So please stop selling yourself short.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It doesn't come from Patriarchy. It comes from the need of aligning the way you look with the Platonic Ideal of yourself. You will never reach that ideal (since it is imaginary and cannot be attained in the changing, material world) but you can be closer to it. Beauty is inherently good, which means you should pursue it. Perfection can never be reached, but it can be chased. Thus, 'changing society' will not fix this problem since it has nothing to do with society. It also cannot be changed because the standards of beauty are eternal and unchanging.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Oh, sweet Jesus. I wrote my previous comment telling you that you're beautiful when I was about seven minutes into your video. And for real, you are (like seriously, you're gorgeous). But....  After watching the rest of it, I feel like telling you some things. And just to let you know, a whole rant is coming up. Also, I'm drunk, so sorry if all this seems a little ham-fisted because of that.  I'm a 38 year old cis-gendered straight man. I had bariatric surgery when I was 33 because I was tired of being fat. It didn't have anything to do with wanting to be sexually attractive to others (I was, and am, happily married to a woman that would love me even if I weighed a thousand pounds). I was tried of looking at my naked body in the mirror and feeling shame.  So I had the surgery. I lost weight. And....I still feel shame when I look at myself in the mirror.  Yeah, I'm not as fat as I used to be, and can never be again. It still doesn't mean that I don't still see what body fat I have in the mirror and think, 'WHY ARE YOU SO FAT?!'  As far as YouTube celebrities go, I look at the Buff Dudes. Jesus Christ, one of them just broke his foot and had to stop working out for three months, and he STILL LOOKS BETTER THAN ME ON MY BEST DAY! Why in the fuck can't I have six pack abs!? Why can the blond guy from Buff Dudes end up with a serious injury and still look more fit than me!? Why are you so fat, JLotus? Don't you even lift?   And just like you, I have people on social media telling me I look great. And just like you, I assume they're all full of shit (although I certainly don't have, nor deserve, the social media following that you have).  And there's also the age thing. I'm almost 40. Jesus Christ, I'm almost 40. Every new birthday from here on out is just going to remind me that I'm getting less strong, less fit, and less likely to be that way.  Anyway, I'm not saying any of this to try to take away your thunder. Far be it from me as a white, cis-gender hetero dude to even think I have the right to do so. I'm just writing this to let you know you're not alone.  Regarding the end of your video, yeah, the world really does need ContraPoints. You're a hero, whether you want to be or not.  Anyway, rant over. Hopefully the replies to this won't be too harsh. I do have feelings, after all!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You can't admit that the leftist 'patriarchy' and all this other Postmodernist deconstructionism is all B.S. If you raise 80 kids with no social conditioning and put them all together when they reach the age of 18, you'll see the same standards of 'attraction' as exist today. The girl who tries shaving her legs and armpits will find that the non-socially-programmed boys find this more attractive, and even the girls will find it more attractive, because it's not social programming - it's natural urges, and it's the wiring of our brains. Standards of attraction have remained stable for millennia. Why can't we just be honest? I have bad teeth, and I will fix my bad teeth ASAP. I don't say, 'Class privilege has made people view coffee-stained teeth as less attractive than white teeth.' My grill is effed, and that's ugly. So what? I'll do my best to fix it, but I don't have anyone more to blame than Mother Nature and Starbucks for the fact that coffee stains on teeth are ugly. You want to be a pretty, big-breasted OC girl, so you're trying to be one. That's cool - you do you, and I wish you well. Heck, if you get there, and if I fix my grill, we might be banging someday, and then all this P.C. postmodernist pedantic garbage will just be a kinky backdrop to some extremely dehumanizing activities that get both of us off. Just admit that you're essentially an over-literate Republican, because you're misleading a bunch of people with all your 'Revolution' nonsense, and you're not going to be a good brick-thrower with all of the estrogen you're taking. Fact is, we're all sort of gross, and the best we can do is try to minimize the damage we do to one another, and maximize the good. The answer isn't in right-wing or leftist ideology, but in common human decency, and in facing reality for what it is rather than trying to evade reality with clever rhetorical maneuvers.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This points out a unique no-win situation for the trans community - loneliness via social exile for not putting in enormous effort to 'pass' or living with the fear that you aren't being authentic by trying so hard. Both are worse for trans women who have the added societal pressure of even narrower expectations on acceptable femininity. At least as a woman in a traditionally masculine career, I can get by with minimal criticism because its at least 'respectable work'.  Anything even associated with women has to be re-branded from as much as possible, whether it be incels (looks maxxing) or TERFs (anti-glam). I think a large part of the reason that she may have been depressed even after working so hard to feel beautiful is that there really is no brand of womanhood that can meet all external expectations of who a beautiful woman is. The only way to win is focusing on those internal feelings. Those moments she has once a month are all by herself when no one is watching! That confidence in itself is beautiful, and practicing that joy in every day life goes a long way in making you more beautiful to everyone else (except maybe to the TERFs and incels - who really aren't worthy anyway).

"Curiously, I sometimes feel as if my own perception of beauty is more 'adptable' than that of the average person. I've sort of always felt weird about the idea of makeup and the likes, even though I can't quite pinpoint why. I guess it seems to me like painting a fake face on top of your real face, and then casually acting as if that's your face, on some level it's weird to me, although I also have lot of contradictory sympathetic feelings about it, which I don't know quite how to resolve. Anyway, I feel as if this mentality has lead me to developing a more realistic perception of beauty, like I *want* to like women for how they really look, and have this *relatively* consistent habit of critically consider why I do or do not like how someone looks.   I want to like women for how they really look, learn to if need be. But that also makes me feel a bit annoyed about the fact that most women and most people on TV do wear makeup, since it kind of confuses my aspiration of always trying to learn how to appreciate realistic human features.    I've also always thought it's unfair that people get treated differently for how they look even when it's not really something they can control. There is something that kind of horrifies me about having the though 'that person is ugly', or at least to think about it in that way, seems so demeaning. There is something cruel about it, and it's kind of spurned me to try develop this ability of aesthetic good will, almost as if I'm trying to re-set my expecations and look at each face as if it was the first one I ever saw, and try to find something to like about it.   But I guess that's also the way I am about a lot of things, be it movies, art, fashion or music. Even when I don't think it's great, I can have this sort of vague unwillingness to really condemn something as bad, I often have that little voice in my head saying 'maybe it's not quite for me', 'I can appreciate the effort that went into this', 'that thing works, kind of?' and 'there's probably something here that's kind of neat'. I sometimes get the sense that other people are more cynical and presumpteous than they need to be when judging things. I can't tell if I'm sometimes more aesthetically open-minded than most people on some level, or if I just lack standards to begin with.   There's a also a bit of a problem with this will I have to want to see everyone as beautiful. Because even if I managed to literally see every face as beautiful, am I not at that point sort of de-valuing the concept of beauty? What would it mean to compliment someone if I could literally give that compliment to any other human? So I feel sort of strangely caught between three options: 1. I could try not to think too much about it and beauty and ugliness to people as it comes, and be able to value beaty according to how rare it is. 2. I could try to see everyone as beautiful, with all the weird contradictions that comes with that. Is beauty a positive if it applies to everyone? If I do go through so much to think of everyone as beautiful, isn't that kind of implying I think beauty is very important? And what happens when I inevitably fail, what if there's some extreme burn victim that I am simply unable to find beautiful, if I extend the label of beautiful to 99% of people, it would almsot seem even more cruel to those in the remaining 1%. 3. I could try to ditch the idea that natural beauty is important, and try to go full makeup-positive. We don't chose how we look by birth, so we could instead try to embrace the idea of defining ourselves by how we chose to look. But would such a culture encourage mroe and more makeup and surgery to attain increasingly fantasytical standards of post-human beauty? Would that kind of society have always ahve room for people who don't wanna use makeup?   I don't really know. This came out really rambly. I'm not sure I made a point, maybe I'm  just virtue-signaling or something. I honestly feel strangely dim-headed right now, I'm just gonna leave this here and hope someone at least reads this mess.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm a woman in academia, and I wear very little makeup (just to cover the black rings around my eyes since I don't sleep much) and I don't dress sexy, but I do get more than enough male attention ;-) even when I'm already married; though lately I've wondered if as I get older (I'm 30) I'll need to use more makeup to look at least as good as I do now haha Anyway, I can't talk for other women, so I'll speak for myself: I don't wear much makeup nor dress super sexy/feminine because I just don't care enough, I see it as a lot of effort, and I honestly never learned to use makeup. It takes time to learn to do your makeup as good as you, and I just never thought it mattered. I guess somewhere in the bottom of my heart I always expected to be loved and noticed as I look or maybe despite how I look . Don't think that every woman who is in academia and doesn't wear makeup is trying to be respected in the field, somehow I find it really depressing that you think that. If it were like that those women would've used makeup before getting in the field, and that's not my experience. My experience is that most people who use makeup as teens continue using it as adults, and those who don't use it as adults usually didn't use it as teens. At least, that's my observation based on the people I know, inside and outside the field. I never used makeup and it wasn't like I knew that I wanted to be in academia when I was a teen. Neither did my best friend (still doesn't) and she's a housewife. Let's just acknowledge that not all people care about the same things and have the same inclinations, needs, etc. It'd be like saying that skinny guys without big muscles don't want to be masculine, uh, THEY DO!, they just don't care enough about those who judge them as such, or they're lazy, or they think they're masculine in their own way, etc. I want to be beautiful like every other woman, I just like to think that I am beautiful without much effort, and my man still loves me like I am, so I'm lucky, I guess.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I will say that women doing makeup even in prison by sucking dick is a strong evidence that women's desire to wear makeup is related to 'because evolution', otherwise you'd just be able to wait it out and not really give a damn. Personally, I think makeup is an partially subconscious and partially conscious thing - the exact beauty standards seems to be coming from our culture, but, the desire to be beautiful seems to come from the depths below, which is the interface between the conscious and the subconscious in regards to makeup.   In a lot of ways, it's potentially also a part of the female social game, which is why women wear makeup for other women to a degree where they seem more concerned about other women's thoughts than men's thoughts. If they really cared about attracting men more so than women, women would be showing all the skin and walk around almost naked half the time, as well as wear various kinda lingerie just for the hell of attracting men. We men aren't that complicated. I'm not complicated, at least. Heh.   ... Or those are my pet theories. I'm more than likely wrong.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The ending made me worry that you were heading toward dark places... Take care of yourself!   I admire the cases you make in your videos (having watched all of them) - they make me think (in a good way), while I mostly spend my free time trying to avoid thinking (the negative way).  Regarding beauty:   I guess I have some deep-seated internalized misogyny and self-loathing influencing my judgement here, but I always immediately dislike women in heavy makeup and/or who are conventionally beautiful. I'd like to say that's because I disapprove of them using so much time and money to look like someone else (instead of more 'worthwhile' pursuits like, er, youtube *oops*) or that they cannot be smart and good people if they are pretty, because that would just be unfair ;). But it's more likely that I just think that I am not, and can never be, beautiful or skillfully made-up, so I have to devalue them misogynisticly as shallow and stupid or untrustworthy, in order to assert myself. Which might be what many other 'Becky'-women do as well. The underlying problem is (at least in my case) low self-esteem, and no amount of makeup or surgery can fix that. In the past, if someone told me I was beautiful, that they liked my body, I just did not believe them. But with time, that is beginning to change. I am beginning to relate to my body in a new way, and sometimes, I look at my image in the mirror and I actually like what I see.  So, I hope you too find a way to make peace with your body, and if surgery helps, than it's good for you. I think you have a fascinating mind and a charming personality, and I actually found you attractive in your first videos  (probably because I like gender-ambiguous presentation like you did back then). I find beauty in your stylistic choices and the art of your videos, even if I find your makeup sometimes overwhelming. (There was one video a while back when you played a lesbian, with a ponytail, little makeup and a checkered shirt? Then I really found you beautiful, with yearning instead of disapproval.  I thought 'I wish I looked like that').   Final remark:  I'm a fan. And I won't shower you with exaggerated compliments you wouldn't believe anyway (not like there's much of a chance you'll ever see this). But I admire the work you do on this channel, I think you deserve respect and admiration, and yes, you are  beautiful... whether I like your style or not. And whether you can see it in yourself or not. <3","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Not only does it look more feminine to me, it even looks prettier.  Not sure if that sabotages your chart earlier, but...

Feeling a bit of unanny valley, as if some random bae tries to pass as Contra. Aaand i got used to it. VIDEO COMMENT: When i was a lil baby everyone told me that accepting myself is the first thing you must learn to become adult, duh. Why would i even bother with looks when there is so much habbits and diets and other shit to manage to keep mind clear and focused. Emotions are product of thoughts anyway, so correct thinking habits = feeling beautiful. ADVICE: Also you are making A GIANT MISTAKE, at least it looks like it. You are getting too close to the mirror/camera, which not only shows the flaws, but also distorts proportions. Everyone looks bad at a kiss distance.   Moral of the story: Good thing i have no instagramm. Also, is it weird that i'm into slightly fat short legless asians? I'm not sure beauty standards even exist anywhere besides our social personas. I bet literally everybody has some weird totally unique kink that absolutely doesn't aligns with what's considered beautiful.

Your skin Can do This by itself, but it Will often create a lot of Oil in order to do This, since Oil protects the surface of the skin.

What I mean to say is, as much as I feel and understand deeply that vain pursuits do not bring lasting joy, we do experience an aesthetic reality, and no one is truly free from judgments based on experiences of the senses. To judge another for vanity is, itself, vanity.    All I would really like to say, however, is that eternal satisfaction comes from eternal sources. What lasts forever? There is an answer, but you won't hear me when I say it. Blissful to age and to die, my body slows to a stop and melts. There is ecstasy in the infinite.

"Ah come on pretty pretty! I had three stages of FFS (Brigitte Meijer, VUMC) last year. I was not impressed. I had my breasts (Laura Zaal, Velthuys) done literally last week thursday,  again, I was more or less elated.  The only thing I found impressive about my GRS (Kanhai, MCA) was the fact I stank like roadkill sweltering a few days in some backyard hospital.  Any pain and discomfort was glorious! A liberation.    Yeah beautiful is the thing we are after. We have to compensate for years of not feeling this. I also had a facial paralysis so it was a double whammy of wanting to be my female self, as well as having a face that was actively menacing to nearly everyone.    Yeah you are in the 2% top in pretty now.  But what I would wish is that I was as pretty on the inside as you. I am dark and damaged inside, and not from over use of plugs. There is a residual hatred and despair in my soul that may take centuries (Aubrey de Grey) to wash away. 2 May this year I lost the person I would marry. A self-identified sissy with a small dick no less. Then she fucking chose prostitution and money and creature comforts over me. I was close to suicide.  I lost 10 kilo bodyweight since the breakup. I can't eat any more.   So that's how much I gained from 5 major surgeries. a year of nearly deadly HRT despair - six month with a pretty sissy (who faked totally being in love with me for at leats half of that), and she walked out on me in favor of a butt-ugly trans prostitute with more money to hook old men for money. We can't win baby. We are circling the black hole. One day I may give myself the push and just fuck off from this planet.  Maybe very soon.  So when you getting tits and pus?

Maybe body shape is inherently part of our perception of that, but makeup is easily changeable and convenient. & I mean, people listen to you and compliment you when your skin is glowing and your eyebrows are perfectly filled... even if everyone knows its just a bunch of powder layered on top of skin. It's I think, at least for me, an adornment of some kind... my 2 cents : )   Plus, many women just put on makeup to watch TV sometimes. What men are they trying to impress? The Starks?

I hope what I'm about to say provides you some good dopamine hits, because it is also entirely true and sincerely expressed.  I have loved everything about your inner beauty from the time I started watching you:  you are intelligent, have an attractive personality, are absolutely hilarious and I love your sense of humor, and you are someone whose honesty in your own inner processes is so genuinely and reflectively articulated that it makes me feel better about my own processes and self-questioning.  I have also thought from the start that you are a beautiful human being physically, and not only one that is beautiful, but one that is personally attractive to me (which doesn't always happen...some people I find attractive are not beautiful, and some people I recognize as beautiful are not attractive to me!).  That is not to undermine you, though, or to devalue your own feelings about your appearance, or to say that you didn't 'need' FFS, or that I liked you better before or anything like that; it also isn't to remotely suggest that your appearance now is in any way deficient, or either greater or lesser than it was before the procedure.  What I can clearly see, though, is that you feel more 'yourself' now than you did before, and if that possibility of feeling that way makes you more yourself, then that does make you more beautiful, and more effectively beautiful, and thus I am in total agreement that such has been the result, and I am very happy that you are more happy, even if surgery didn't solve all of the problems or make you suddenly more confident in your level of beauty.  That you have shared all of this so honestly actually makes you even that much more beautiful, in my view, because the truth of your inner struggles and the reality of them then shines through that much more in your newfound outer beauty transformations.  I'm sure you're familiar with the Ancient Greek concept of kalokagathia, which is both pernicious and false, and yet also so utterly true to how many of us experience the world whether we would intellectually prefer to or not.  More could be said about that, certainly...  And, just to be clear about these things:  whatever one might assume about my name, I'm a gender-diverse person (that's a long story!), encompassed imperfectly but fairly accurately by the non-binary label, and I find you attractive and beautiful in a variety of ways.  Very few people find me beautiful physically, though the few who have come to appreciate me in my fullest gender identity have tended to do so (and that's not even a handful of people that I've met personally at this point!); some straight women and gay men have found me attractive but have not accepted my gender identity, and thus I have no time for them at all because they then try to impose inappropriate standards, behavior requirements, and mindset expectations (amongst other things!) on me which I both cannot and will not fulfill for them.  In the interests of brevity, and trying to sustain your dopamine hits from before (if the above was useful in that regard!), I will keep this confessional to the present length for now.  But again, thank you for your ongoing work, and your inspirational influence, and especially so on this not-awful-but-not-fantastic-either natal day of mine today!  I eagerly await what you will present for us the next time!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Interesting video as always. I thought you looked amazing before, but you look even better now.   As for me, I've not had and don't plan on having FFS. I have had SRS which has gotten rid of the majority of my dysphoria. But as for my face, I'm pretty happy with the changes from HRT. I usually don't even bother with make up unless I'm going to work or performing. To work because it feels more professional and on stage because I want to look as good as possible. In day to day life, I figure that I look 'okay'. Based on what I used to look like as a man, I think it's pretty amazing that I've been able to turn myself into something resembling a woman. I've got pretty good genetics to thank for a lot of it. My mother is 70 but looks closer to 50 so hopefully I will age in a similar fashion. Of course, I still worry about the effects of aging. I have very fair skin so I burn very easily anyway, but I read somewhere that Kate Beckinsale wears sunscreen every day as part of her skin care regime. She's 10 years older than me but looks 10 years younger than me, so I've added that into my own daily skin regime. I guess though, because I'm asexual, I don't have that desire to attract anyone, so I just try and make myself happy with how I look. Sometimes that probably looks a bit quirky to others, but it's what feels right for me.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's a double edged sword.   I think that the more you obsess over beauty standards, the better your taste becomes, and the more refined your self (or other) criticisms become. You COULD spend that time and energy into 'altruistic' ventures, but you'd sacrifice your carefully honed aesthetic tastes. I never put in the effort into such things, and developed tastes in others, but I lament never having done so. I wish I had great taste in fashion, decor, and self care. I wish I could look great and express myself in the ways you maybe take for granted. For every pore you think is too large, is a plain black hanes tshirt with holes I've worn to work 3 days in a row, because I can't be bothered to find anything better.

"Ok, given that this video is pretty new, maybe someone will read this and I'll get some sort of explanation. What exactly is up with Nat's use of 'biological'? Like, I get that she uses the terms sort-of ironically most of the time, but it's still a little confusing to me, since the 'biologically female' descriptor is something I usually use as a polite way of describing cis-female attributes, whilst trying do sound invalidating to trans women and whatnot.  I remember she talked about her 'biological titties' once, and that seems to have made sense *enough* in the context, since her breasts are grown from estrogen. I guess her now saying her brain is biologically female is a way of saying she probably is fundamentally wired to have a female gender identity?  But often I'm not quite sure exactly what rational is behind her use of the term, and I'm not even entirely sure to what extent it's a joke or not, and it sort of get me worried that fence-sitters who see the video will dismiss her as being delusional or deceptively new-speaking or something, since 'biological' this and that seems to usually be used for talking about natually developed cisgender attributes.  Can anyone clue me in if there is something I'm not getting about this? I'd google it instead of asking comment questions, but I don't think I can specifially google Nat's rational behind the usage of a word.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Tbh, I have an obsession with beauty as well.

It caused me to lose confidence in my appearance and I would basically look at myself in the mirror in disgust. I am currently working on losing weight but tbh I still don't like associating my own fat as being 'good looking'. Like I have a body shape similar to Ethan Klein and it really just bugs me. If you think only women deal with some form of beauty or personal self loathing regarding ones appearance it's not as black white as you think.

Looking beautiful doesn't make you happy and when you're happy, you won't care about your appearance.  It's that simple. Anytime your brain tells you you're too fat, or too old or whatever, it also tells you that all your friends secretly hate you.  So you gotta fucking ignore it.

I love dark, baggy 'boyish' clothes that blur the lines and make me look more androgynous-but I also love flowery, lacy, over the top fairy makeup complete with horned flower crowns and a rainbow butterfly cape. From years of being identified as female I've learned that I like a lot of feminine things, but some days I don't have the energy to wear them, even if I want to. Especially on my period (god help me) I feel like my body is forcing me to be feminine in a way I have control over and even if I want to wear that adorable purple dress, there's no way in hell I'm walking out of the house in anything but shapeless, black clothes and a backwards cap.

"You are very intelligent and funny so kudos to that and I sincerely don't want to burst your bubble and hurt your feelings, but the truth is that what you are doing may be severely damaging to many humans who are confused and/or have damaged endocrine systems (due to poor diet, lack of exercise, etc) coupled with emotional trauma from dysfunctional relationships with male and female role models (due to poor parenting, mostly). You still look and sound like a dude. This of course doesn't meant you still can't find happiness, but it's not beneficial to humanity to celebrate or condone a mental illness as it can easily normalize it in others. What confused, damaged individuals need is love, hugs, kisses, and a good family and friends support system to aid them in getting back into living a healthy life as ascribed by their dna. And no, I'm not a 'transphone', I'm a realist who looks at the stats which show overt evidence towards the fact that the majority of people who transition are worse off for it in the long run. Wishing everyone peace, healing, and harmony. And yes, I know that my comment will most likely be completely fruitless as you have 600k subs so will not stop making youtube videos due to the good income it provides, but I still strongly suggest you take a good long look at science-backed biology and transition into becoming a positive force for the world, not an insidiously divisive one...   Also, bare with me but nihilistic bitter 'progressives' need to stop myopically and ignorantly calling everything they dislike or find silly a 'social construct'. All the 'bad' stuff in the world didn't just instantly explode out of the void. They naturally arise due to the advantages they provide in our naturally evolving hierarchies. For example if you were a woman who lived in a village of 50 men and 50 women and wanted to mate with the strongest male to produce the strongest children, you would look for any advantage you could find. If you ate some bright red berries which turned your lips redder or you just did some physical exercise which made your cheeks rosy-colored, you would naturally find that the men in your tribe started to find you more sexually attractive therefore you would do these aforementioned tricks more frequently. This is why makeup can be found in human cultures across the globe, even in small villages - it naturally arises due to the competitive edge it gives. Sincerely ask yourself: if an apocalypse occurred and you were the last human alive in your area, would you still take time to diligently put on makeup to 'feel prettier'? The answer is that the real world would come crashing down and your natural survival instincts would kick in real quick. There would be more pressing matters. So anyway my point is that the term 'social construct' is a tautological say-nothing phrase developed by intelligent post-modernist professors looking for ways to write papers which weren't previously written in order to garner praise from their nerd community and keep their jobs, so to take the time to harp on it as detrimental is antithetical to nature itself and thus will never be expunged from societies. The English language has enough words and tools with implicit power coming from distant perspectives imbued into them to enable this divisive 'new-think' posits, but that itself does not mean it should be done. Knowledge is great but it can go too far into anti-human territory, as displayed here (aka too much cognitive dissonance is bad for humans). Thank you for reading and do something to make yourself proud today, even if it's just a small action.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I am pretty sure that beauty is not an invention of some trans-dimensional reptilian overlords bent on preserving its leash on humanity. Beauty is innate. we know what beauty is just like we know that pizza tastes good: it is a natural desire put through a cultural lens. wanting to be beautiful is as organic and immutable as wanting to eat cake. You don't spend several thousand dollars on plastic surgery to fix your beauty obsession, though. that is an unbalance of desires that can not be satisfied. You get the surgery to stop the distraction so you can focus on fixing the imbalance. or, work out, or play with make up, or buy new shoes.   these things are pleasurable, and we need to keep them in perspective. being attractive is exciting and fun and necessary. it feels good to look nice. it feels good to hear compliments. and, these things can have powerful affects on your self-esteem. I don't think there is any shame in giving in to things that feel good. Just don't get it twisted: you are the same person, no matter how many millimeters of bone you add or subtract. being pretty is therapy. it makes the journey to self acceptance easier. but, it is still a journey that must be taken. you can't just put on a new pair of shoes and expect to be teleported to self-actualization.   at least, that's what I think.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Being beautiful (for me) is a way to seek people's approval, and am messed up and I resent people's approval, therefore I have no desire to look good and I don't try. Does this mean there is something wrong with me or is there something wrong with everyone else? It's probably me, but I really have no idea. One day I am going to be ugly, and after that, I'll be dead. So why care about shallow superficial opinions about something as meaningless as looks?   Humans. They are obsessed with what they see in front of them; boobs, skin color, TV, food pictures on instagram. I don't know what more meaningful things there are to care about, I just get sick of the surface things like the beauty magazines and the celebrity gossip. You can still like those things and be a wonderful person, but for someone like me who isn't interested, people look at me as uncool and a sloppy untrendy loser. Good.

"I remember first encountering Contrapoints when I first got into political YT several months ago on the Incels video. I didn't get very far into the video unfortunately, but I thought 100% that she was a woman. This was at a time when I still held onto the belief that there were only 2 genders. A few weeks later, I started watching more vids and enjoyed all of them until I eventually got to a video where she said she was a trans woman. I was thoroughly shocked. I had absolutely no idea and it would've never crossed my mind. Many thanks to Contra for providing content and sharing her experience so people can learn not only about politics, but on gender and sexuality. It certainly helped me to accept the trans community, and I'll never not see Contra as a woman. I have a friend who's transitioning from female to male, and I'm not sure I would've been able to accept it without her videos. Thank you Contrapoints for everything you do.

"Thank you for making this video. I've always struggled with Body dysmorphic disorder as a teen, and my whole shtick is that I have to be thin as a twig, because all young, attractive teenage women are thin as a twig, and if I'm not thin as a twig I'm an ugly, fat failure. What is even more ridiculous is that I find other women who are overweight or curvy completely normal and beautiful, and if I were to somehow detach from my body and view it as someone else, I would probably think, 'Wow, look at that totally normal girl who has a normal weight and is not at all horrendously fat.' At my lowest point, I legitimately started to think I should actively try and become anorexic. Thankfully, some sense was still left in me, and at that point I realized I needed to stop obsessing so hard over the fact that my stomach wasn't as flat as a my hair, and it's probably just going to stay that way no matter how many times I glare at it in a mirror.   I do believe representation works, because every time I see a woman who is plus-size, curvy, or simply has a little chub who is admired by society, it chips away at the feeling that I'm not good enough if I'm not thin enough. Watching your videos and seeing the way you present yourself with all the glamour and no apologies has also inspired me to accept myself and my own beauty. You are an inspiration to awkward teen girls everywhere, and you can totally believe me when I say you're genuinely beautiful, because, like, I never lie about these things so you can 100% trust me.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'We sat upon a bench, placed for the sake of one of these views, whence we looked down upon the waterfall, and over the open country ... A lady and gentleman, more expeditious tourists than ourselves, came to the spot; they left us at the seat, and we found them again at another station above the Falls. Coleridge, who is always good-natured enough to enter into conversation with anybody whom he meets in his way, began to talk with the gentleman, who observed that it was a majestic waterfall. Coleridge was delighted with the accuracy of the epithet, particularly as he had been settling in his own mind the precise meaning of the words grand, majestic, sublime, etc., and had discussed the subject with William at some length the day before. 'Yes, sir,' says Coleridge, 'it is a majestic waterfall.' 'Sublime and beautiful,' replied his friend. Poor Coleridge could make no answer, and, not very desirous to continue the conversation, came to us and related the story, laughing heartily.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"'we critique things', no, you come up with elaborate excuses to deny the reality of the world.  Blaming beauty standards on 'patriarchy',  come on now, you may as well blame god because beauty standards are based on evolutionary forces.  Before anyone tries the old 'look at the old art of fatties' or points at abstract fertility statues, go look at Micheangelo's Pieta and then come back.  Elite tastes have always been fringe, unrepresentative of the norms of their day, look at modern art being sold for millions, however when artists were tasked with glorifying god to the masses, that is when you saw the truth of what was always beautiful.  Jesus's mother was depicted as not just unnaturally young, but thin and beautiful, that is the truth your 'critiques' deny.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You know, talk smack about cis white straight males all you want, but at least they're honest. One time a guy said to me, 'Those two girls are too annoying for how little pretty they are.' Kinda a dick thing to say, but we all do it some extent, and most people probably do it to the same extent he does, they just don't know it or say it.  Also, it's not only your responsibility to care less about how you look, it's also up to other people to judge you less on your looks. I feel like all the 'you're so beautiful!' comments are kinda counter productive, since it reduces your importance to just your physical appearance rather than content of character.  Speaking of which, great video! I really love the rawer, more honest approach.  Also, the more ad-libbed, deadpan, mundane dialogue is usually a sign to me of a YouTube channel becoming insufferably self-indulgent, but yet you somehow managed to pull it off tastefully, and I'm not trying to flatter here.

"A book on etiquete from the 1920ies said: 'You cannot make yourself more beautiful but you can make yourself more pleasant' and there is some truth to it. There was this one guy who was short and overweight so definitely not the conventional beauty type but even the most prissy queens flocked to him. He wore tailor fit clothes (both casual outfits as well as suits) so the clothes he was wearing, while nothing outrageous were always flattering (not too tight so that he looked like a sausage, not too flappy like wearing a tent), his hair was always nice and he always was wearing subtle perfumes. On top of that he was such a pleasant, outgoing character. that it was such a pleasure to hang around with him. In short, he did what Natalie said, cultivating an aestetic and it did work.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think this idea that you shouldn't care at all how you look is flawed view largely stemming to the idea of body as a mere vessel for you rather than inescapable part. This especially true for more privileged people: women, PoC, trans people and people with disabilities are less able to abstract themselves is way because they often have navigate around the ways people perceive them.     Your body is a part of you and it is good to look after yourself. Dressing and presenting in a way that makes you happy is self-care. As someone into alt-fashion, the idea that people only dress-up to impress is laughable. Sometimes the look that makes you happy, others don't like, or even mock, but if it really makes you happy, you put up with it, because the price is worth it.   Hot, attractive... Often I have trouble defining these things enough in others. The best feeling I've gotten from my appearance was the feeling of being a living art piece, like my every movement had meaning and that I something more, better than myself.

"Honestly, I give you an 8. I think you're a bit hard on yourself.   Though really it's all subjective as different people will have different reactions to different aesthetics. Beauty may have various agreed upon directions, but there is no such thing as universal beauty, or even objective beauty. So I guess in that regard numbers are meaningless. The only way to really judge your own beauty is to do so comparatively with yourself as a measure of progress. And that without getting into the less tangible aspects such as self confidence or positivity that can add their own, in my unsolicited opinion greater, factor to beauty.

"Maybe mankind's main problem is everybody always wants to control their environment but individually not everyone can wield that control. Maybe part of learning to be happy is learning that an 'alright' level of control is good enough. It seems that chasing an ideal of anything, be it beauty or anything else, is always going to result in feelings of inadequacy. Of course the problem is that we're constantly being fed these ideals from every corner of the media, which is bound to have an effect on us eventually, like you say, even if we can analyse it. I mean we can all say 'you look great' (which you do in my opinion) or equally say nasty things but it's about which voices you are really affected by and how that feeds into this ultimately unattainable ideal. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't want to see you destroy your body, so maybe an end point would be a good idea to set out.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I even discovered your channel in a midst of a leftist politics deep dive that I conducted as a result of critique-induced frenzy. It sometimes feels like the only way to live a morally appropraite life is absolute self-abnegation in all respects, attempting to adhere to every critique and repress anything that goes against them.

"It's interesting that I saw this now because I went through this exact same dilemma just now. While I'm neither trans, nor a woman, nor did I have surgery (yeah, another straight, cis, white dude adding his 2 privileged cents), I still rarely feel attractive to the point where it really hurts my self-confidence. I'm very skinny and in no way fit the ideal man standard (aka Captain America). BUT being in a relationship with someone that finds me physically attractive (and otherwise) makes me feel better and makes feel like I should be kinder and more accepting of myself. While I can always improve (aka dropping 50 bucks on skin care products that may not work [yes, I know but it's a lot for a dude]), just knowing that there are people who think I am attractive as is is awesome and I think that the fact that people are expressing their attraction to you (i.e me) is something in itself.   Ps: yes, this is written with the awareness that beauty standards for men in this capitalist-driven patriarchal society is significantly lower than for women. So instead if feeling beautiful once a month, it's more like twice a month.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I have seen many people critique the aesthetics of minimalism and the way it focuses on individual action over collective change, and I think you could add some cool stuff to those conversations too, but I would be particularly interested in your take on the particular ways in which people 'minimize in order to do what they love' (a classic example: live out of a backpack in order to be that rich white guy on vacation in Southeast Asia for three years, or to start yet another fricking podcast, instead of helping their communities with their spare time), because of how good you are at explaining the shitty sources of desires while also understanding why people still hold on to them.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"That bit about academia really hit home for me. I just graduated (thank christ) from a masters program and after observing the differences between the male and female professors and fellow students, I've become even more convinced that this whole frigging system is rigged. My male professors often showed up looking more like students than we did, while my female professor (there were only three total, so not a huge sample) was always dressed sharply and professional, but she was often left out of the decision making for the program. One of my classmates wore graphic tees and jeans the whole time he taught a class and no one said shit, where as when I taught and wore makeup and what I thought were nice clothes, I got called dramatic in my student reviews. I was the only woman in the department who wore visible, over-the-top (according to some) makeup, and it felt really alienating that this art form that I've come to really enjoy put me as an outsider and made people judge me before I had a chance to open my mouth.  But it's also made me realize that none of it matters, I'm gonna get shit either way, so I might as well wear the swamp green eyeshadow if I want.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You equate beauty/vanity with being female, and then say that you don't feel beautiful ie you don't feel like you're the 'pretty rich girl' your autogynephilic mind thinks you are, you even admit it is all psychological, not physical. The thing is, you're a man. You weren't socialized into femininity and so the only thing you think makes a woman is makeup and nails and dresses and superficial bullshit. You see women as vanity. That's why it doesn't make sense to you that women might not want to perform femininity. You can only think of being a woman the way men do, externally and superficially. You don't understand that when a woman doesn't not perform femininity she is treated differently and has been peer and self regulated to do so, even in prison. However, you can perform femininity and be a man, anyone can perform femininity, because femininity isn't what makes women women.

"I do... Care about being 'Beautiful,' even if most people think I don't, but I've strongly backlashed against it because of how I was abused as a child, not given food, being screamed at in dressing rooms. 'Why can't you be pretty like your sisters?' 'Ugly girl,' 'Fat girl,' that I went the complete opposite direction. It was cemented when I was raped by my first (and only) boyfriend. I decided, fuck you. You think I'm ugly now? You ain't SEEN ugly yet.  I refuse to shave or wear makeup. I've gained a lot of weight. I deliberately wear clashing clothes. Sometimes I go five or more days between showers. I wish I could say it worked. I wish I could say it keeps me safe. But it doesn't. Just a few weeks ago I was cornered in the mall elevator by some young men who called me 'fatty' and 'big belly' and I was so afraid someone would try to touch me or hurt me. I was shaking by the time the elevator got to my floor and I hurried into the nearest shop. They followed me, but eventually left. It keeps me safe because men usually leave me alone.

"Thought I'd share this: The med/tech school I go to is predominantly female. Girl, you know we wear makeup for ourselves. It let's me know they feel good about themselves, they radiate it, and onlookers give recognition. I love to see people present themselves in however their current physical best. It's not about trying to impress. Makeup is a tool the same way clothes are a tool. Even our skills to socialize is a tool. These are just outward extensions (or expressions) of ourselves that help people see it in a different forms.   As for bone structure... all my sister's have defined yet feminine. Mine is diminished in comparison. At first glance, it curves more feminine than theirs, but it honestly makes me look anorexic in comparison. My mandible doesn't accommodate the amount of teeth I have. It's overcrowded, crooked, even with all wisdom teeth out.  The upper hard palate of my mouth is warped and the TMJ has given me migraines for years. I got the slim jawline of my dad's family and the somewhat large teeth from my mother's side. Genetics is so weird.   If you're at all familiar with Roger Scruton's book on Beauty, I suggest you read it and let me know if you think it's useful. I've found it to help me out when I felt super ugly and thought my art major was stupid.   (Sorry, it's sooooo long)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thank you for being brutally honest about this, and about how getting surgery didn't magically change your feelings. My 2 cents for anyone struggling with this, as someone who's mostly recovered from an eating disorder and used to lock myself in the house for weeks at a time because I thought I was too ugly to go outside, is you gotta consciously change your thoughts. I used to be so self-conscious about my bumpy crooked nose until I started looking up women who had the same thing, seeing how beautiful they are, and deciding to look in the mirror and tell myself I have a powerful Roman goddess nose and my bump is where I store my power. It feels fake at first, but the feeling becomes genuine over time. It's also a good practice to find things you like about strangers. I've noticed that the more I see other people and their flaws as beautiful, which imo is easier than doing it to yourself at first, the more that attitude leaks into looking in the mirror.  Funny to think this method that actually worked for me was in direct contrast to what I experienced in a psychiatric hospital after a suicide attempt. The nurses actually considered it a sign of improvement when women put on makeup, did their hair, etc. I wasn't allowed to have sci fi books, but makeup and hair tools with supervision was fine. This was a really weird and harmful message to get as a suicidal, anorexic, and self-conscious teenage girl. The men's mental health wasn't measured by how visually presentable they were. Even if it's not about attracting men for sex, I wonder how much women are taught that we have to appealing for other people in general. And thats how 'my pores are big' is turned into 'I'm not acceptable as a human female'.   I find certain aspects of beauty fun, like eyeliner and playing with hairstyles and fashion, but I dont hate how I look without them. Every human is statistically a miracle just for existing, so, like, who cares that I have a weak chin. The trees and lizards certainly don't give a shit, so I'm gonna try not to either.  Idk this turned into an essay  because I've been thinking about it  a lot lately. I really think unconditional self-love is one of the most powerful tools for change in ourselves and the world, but it's a skill that has to be practiced.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I moved to Maui about a year ago and now I'm pressuring myself to live up to beauty standards that I never cared about before. If you would've asked me a year ago what I thought about tanning, I would've said it's pointless and a good way to get cancer, but now I obsess over it. In fact, just today, I spent hours on the beach in the sun, because everyone here is so tan and it's a different standard than Colorado, so now it's another thing I'm self conscious about. And then of course there's the issue of having a perfect 'bikini body'. I've always been naturally skinny and never really had a problem with disliking my body before this year, but now I absolutely despise my stomach and spend so much time looking at other girls and wishing I looked like them. Ironically, it was just yesterday that I lectured someone on the importance of representation of different body types in the media, and then turned around and skipped lunch before going to the beach.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Okay I'm a little frustrated. I'm a transwoman too just FYI for this minor critique. Also I think this was a great video as always.  I've supported Contra since back when she was pissing off 9/11 truthers and calling herself Nycotine. I will continue to support her... But FFS (not the kind this video is about).  In recent videos she has made small but repeated digs about how the members of the trans community are treating her bad. Sometimes implying how people in the trans community are some kind of unempathetic, negging, hive mind.  I get that someone reading other people's opinions that it would feel like there is a mass against you and I can't even begin to imagine what effect that has.... But we aren't a homogenous blob of the same opinion.   Look it's wrong that the internet is so critical and pushes all these expectations on prople. I know I'm only adding to that by putting more critique out there. I know it hurts more when it comes from people who share experiences with you.  None of this changes the fact that this perpetuation of viewing trans people as the enemy of contrapoints is total BS. That's the real internalised transphobia right there.   Never have I been more free to speak uncensored than since coming out in the trans community. Sure I get people disagreeing with me all the time. I'd put money on people disagreeing with this comment. (Especially since I am wording it like a total asshole) That doesn't mean that the people who disagree with me are trying to force me into conformity. That doesn't mean that the people disagreeing with me don't have a point.   What I find strange about this is I think that Natalie displays an extreme self awareness of her internalised prejudices when she is discussing them on her own terms. But when discussing how trans people have criticized her o feel a level of contempt that pigeonholes any trans person who has disagreements with her point of view.   Maybe I'm reading into shit. Maybe I'm projecting. But I don't know if I can accept seeing the contra fans who shit on the trans people who felt hurt by contra videos even if I wasn't hurt by them personally. And I can't not wonder if having those sly digs at trans people without contextualising the overwhelming support she has from trans people adds fuel to the flames of the flame wars against trans people. Trans people who want to have their experience heard without people acting like they are attempting regicide toward the Bread Queen.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"15:00 what about competing with other women and being so obsessed with appearance and BEAUTY, due to wearing makeup all their life, they feel compelled to wear on the off chance so handsome man comes strutting by. It's anxiety probably with diagnosed body dysmorphic disorder. I had it and even the woman treating me at the time had it albeit to a far smaller extent. I could have timestamped more and retorted a lot of what you say Contra but you probably won't read this anyway so that will do.   You need to spend lest time in your left-wing hang outs because I believe they sour your worldview. Beauty standards aren't transphobic, fatphobic or (insert insecurity here in place of an argument)phobic. Beauty is rooted in nature and nature has it's beauty standards. Can beauty be moulded by society from this based model? Sure. But no matter how warped and twisted these standards may become, the absolute will always be there and biology isn't discriminatory in any way. It just does as designed.     If you want some real advice Contra try taking say five grams of psilocybin mushroom. Even if you don't trip it will have a positive effect on your mental health and alleviate your depression. Studies and my own experience are what lead me to believing this. In addition to this meditation for say thirty minutes at a time or ten minutes at first I reckon will help. Help you relax, clear your thoughts from distraction and think on what's important.   If you wonder why I want to help you despite disagreeing with you so much it's because I pity you and your loved ones.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a trans man, sometimes I worry that wanting to be attractive, or dare I say, pretty, might lead others, including other trans people to accuse me of being a 'transtrender.' Despite being on HRT and having felt feelings of dysphoria since my late teens, 10 yea4s ago, and despite so much of our community constantly shouting from the rooftops 'not all trans people [insert woke statement here]' I still worry that people will label me a faker or whatever because I want to be, specifically, a pretty man. I grapple with expectations to look rugged or underkempt and my own desires for clear skin and nice hair, even though I know my feelings about skin, in particular, can be unrealistic and a major cause of stress in my life.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Gigi seems to use bronzer and has bleach blonde hair, and has gone for the teeth-whitening and stuff - it's the hyper-real Baywatch look. As you confessed, there are moments in your life where you feel beautiful, so it's not a pathological aversion or anything.   It's personal 'flaws' you are focussing on, and I think it's operating like depression. You know like how depression creates a network that fast-tracks any kind of mild sadness into a full of meltdown. The first thing they say is if you find yourself asking, 'Why do I feel sad?' - then you should immediately ignore trying to solve the problem and get distracted by something else instead - because once you start trying to solve why you feel unhappy, you'll find a million things from your memories to fill that question.  So instead of looking for flaws, try to create new points of interest. Hair seems to be something that fucks with people a lot. Especially bald people. So it's probably worth experimenting with. : )","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's ok to want to be beautiful. I also agree that's probably more of a psychological thing, and probably harmful in the long run. I don't think everyone obsess about beauty, to be honest, but I think many more people obsess over it nowadays. I think it's specially true for you for obvious reasons (the video editing, you being trans). You are beautiful, but it doesn't matter what anyone says.  Also, it's very different to know something rationally and to truly internalize it. I think it's like that with almost every psychological problem. I know it's totally dumb to be afraid of having phone calls, but I'm still am, and feeling guilty about it just makes it worse. I think it works in a similar way with the beauty obsession. You know rationally it's not a great thing to obsess about, but knowing it rationally doesn't change much. I think only some kind of internal paradigm change, maybe a gradual one, can help with that. I also know 'internal paradigm change' is too vague, but I'm thinking about the kind of changes promoted by cognitive behavioral types of therapies that tries to 'drive home' some things we know rationally.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"...did anybody else suddenly need stare at their _own_ face in the mirror at some point during this video?  Just me?  Okay. I'm also not sure if I should be passing judgement at all on a video about elaborate, planned beauty when I'm such a don't-care schlubby tomboy, but then I get distracted looking down at my beautiful, metallic, FLAMING pink new nail polish.  shiiiinnnnyyy...  I guess what I'm saying is that there's nothing wrong with caring about beauty.  If that's what makes a person feel better, feel...more their true self, (and it doesn't hurt anyone), then go for it!   Wait, that sounded way more flip than I intended to...what I mean is, regardless of where the standards come from, makeup and related subjects are about playing around with image and being creative, figuring out fun (and beautiful!) new ways to express yourself.  You know how they call people who professionally put makeup on actors, makeup ARTISTS?  Well...yeah.  It can still be art if you're doing it _un_professionally, and on just yourself.  As for the 'schlubby tomboy with SHIIINNNNYYYY metallic pink fingernails' thing?  I guess my point there is that not every part of a person fits into the same stereotype.  My body's style is lazy, comfy...not deliberately trying to look more like a man, but more....just not giving a fuck about pouring on extra feminine, and I care way more about comfort than whether or not society, men, whatever find me acceptable.  My hair's style is usually 'get out of my face', and my glasses style is somewhat cutesy hipster. But my NAILS are drag-queen as FUCK.  Well, maybe not drag queen, they're not long enough.  _Glam_ as fuck, that'll have to do.  Loose comfy superhero t-shirt, jeans...GLITTERY RAINBOWS ON MY FINGERS.  That's me.   My point is caring about beauty isn't anything to be ashamed of, especially when in a trans-woman's case, it's also about _not_ setting off 'Hmmm, something is off here...' bells in people's minds as you try to casually go about your business.  And there's nothing wrong with it because it doesn't hurt anybody.  Anyway.  Do whatever the fuck style you want, again, as long as it's not hurting anybody, and even do a _mix_ of styles, or wear one thing one day and an entirely different _genre_ of look the next!  And don't let anybody shame you for your concerns.  Your concerns are _yours_ , not theirs.  And considering how society views, treats people and flips out over beauty...it's a perfectly legit thing to be worried about.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I actually feel like I really needed this video. I'm a woman in academia, trying to get my PhD to become a political philosopher and/or professor-- I definitely have developed an anti-beauty complex and it's been interesting and at points, kind of toxic. I used to be really into makeup and image (just very vain in general) and I can't seem to always disconnect makeup from those feelings. I've always found myself asking why anyone should care about beauty. Not only this, but so many makeup products are made so unsustainably and through exploitative labor (which lots of things are, but it seems like there's not many ethical options for beauty products as of yet). As someone who adheres quite a bit to communalism, it's just been very hard for me to completely grasp makeup/beauty now when so many things contribute to several exploitative/dominating systems. I've been pushing myself to be more open-minded, however.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I want to just say that It makes me a bit sad to think that maybe Natalie feels perhaps at times that her efficacy as a voice for honest compassionate and respectful discussion of Trans and left issues is Influenced by her ability to maintain a standard of beauty or unique style.   I was personally introduced to the channel way back during the peak dysphoria time of 'why i quit academia' and it was never style or beauty that kept me watching. I don't want to get all disengenously 'Inner Beauty' here but the thing that maintained interest genuinely WAS that Natalie was informed, articulate and, very importantly, funny.     In fact In someways the fact that Natalie at that time looked rather (and I'll try and be kind here) 'awkward' did a lot to FORCE me as a Cis guy to confront the fact that Trans people deserve the simple respect of acknowledging thier identity and humanity wether or not they pass. I don't really know the point I'm trying to make here tbh, but I think it's at least a good Idea to reflect on the possibility that many of us might not have been drawn to the channel if Contra had always been beautiful.

"I actually do like how women look without makeup and I don't dislike how they look with it either.  Whenever I'm with someone I just love how they look after a shower, with nothing on (as opposed to incels judging strangers with discrete makeup). The human body is just so beautiful: the scattering if light on the skin, the natural rosing of the capillaries, the random distribution and uniform density of hairs, pigmentation, everything you would conceal. Not even the discoloration under the eyes (which everyone has some) or other 'defects' detracted from my finding everything so beautiful. I used to get lost studying the features of my partners while they read or we watched TV at night.  With my longest term girlfriend, she loved wearing makeup and styling her hair, and wearing beautiful clothes. The thing is I would encourage her, because it's her body, not an object for my pleasure, and she did look beautiful having fun with it. She did it for herself and for the image she wanted projected to the world, not for my benefit, and that's cool. There were plenty of times for me to admire my preferred look, so I could also enjoy hers.

"Perfect timing!  Recently I've made the connection between style and self-image. I hated myself a lot when I younger, and I didn't put effort into my appearance. It was easier to deflect my thoughts from 'I hate who I am as a human being' to 'I look disgusting.'  Now I've been healing my deeper issues, and I've been thinking about my personal style and aesthetics more. I always heard 'I dress up for myself' and rolled my eyes. But I get it now. Looking stylish is like a little gift to myself. I don't NEED to put in the extra time, but that extra time spent on myself is a small way of me caring for myself.  I want to present myself in a way that makes me happy. And it makes me happy to represent my personality through my a e s t h t i c.

"Hey, if my autistic ass could acclimate to Blaire White's FFS, I can handle this. Hell, it should take me half as long, since you went for the 'normal pretty woman' look and not the 'Malibu Barbie' look. I mean, to each her own, but one is a tad more Uncanny Valley than the other, y'know? I just don't adjust to change too easily.   I know it's cliche to say, but you were always gorgeous and feminine to me. I'm just glad that you match your own personal aesthetics now. I'd like that for myself one day (if only they'd stop making junk food so goddamn cheap and delicious and find a cure for Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, I'd be all fucking set).

"Random anecdote about beauty buried in the comments: Keeping it vague for personal reasons.  When I grew up I was generally not considered attractive (except my mom, of course, who always said I was BOOTIFUL). That's not just low self-esteem. I had a hard time getting a girlfriend, was considered the ugliest of my group of friends once when overhearing gossip and everything lined up with that fact. I wasn't hideous, just lower than average. 4/10. Run-of-the-mill unattractive.  I travel to another country. First thing I notice - ok, not the first thing, that would be the 'welcome' sign - I noticed my sense of beauty was kinda out of whack with this new place. People looked very different from my norm and the standards that THEY used to separate themselves between 'beautiful' and 'ugly' did not always match with what I had in mind.  Not only that, but in this new country I happen to look exotic and I guess my ugly traits weren't seen that way by the people there as ugly. Suddenly, I'm on the other end of the pool. Even in a new country, I didn't turn heads. But I was definitely considered handsome now. I felt it in how people treated me and talked about me, good or bad.   The two things I learned, from being immersed in completely different environments with different standards of beauty?   1- It's completely arbitrary. Bullshit. It's like saying people with big feet are ugly and people with small feet are attractive. It's like saying people who can whistle are beautiful, and those who can't are ugly. They change from place to place, depending on what's rare and what's common, and it never really makes much sense. It's one thing to know this, intellectually. It's another to actually experience it yourself.   2- Being temporarily handsome did not improve my self-esteem that much or make life easier for me. Some things were actually weird, like getting praise for work I knew was shitty just because of my looks. I also got some jealousy my way, which wasn't fun.     Overall? I wasn't happy in either end of the spectrum. I think the middle of the road might be the best place to be, beauty wise. Being neither attractive or unattractive, passing unnoticed. Being ignored is bliss, after the nastiness I experienced on either end. (all that said though, it's a HELL of a lot easier to get a girlfriend if you're attractive. I have confirmed that. I mean, it's not empirical evidence, just my crappy life story, but that's what I experienced.)  TL;DR - beauty standards change a lot from country/group to another. I've experienced both sides of the coin thanks to that. It's weird.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Nat, you do what you need to do to feel happy.  There are all sorts of things we've all internalized that are bullshit.  Some of them involve gender, class, ethnicity...  You'd practically have to be a sociopath to actually cast all that social conditioning off.  Part of being human is l i v [ing]  i n   a   s o c i e t y, and so it only seems natural that you'd internalize some of those norms of that society, even if you can intellectualize that they're bullshit.  My wife really wants to have public sex (not 'not allowed near schools again' public, just 'in a room with a glass wall for consenting adults to watch' public), and while I know that a) the nearby club where we could do that is a safe space in which I'm sure we'd be welcomed and accepted, and b) she won't leave me because some guy gets a look at how gorgeous she is naked and compliments her about it, the lizard part of my brain that was trained to be self-conscious about my own physical unattractiveness and covetous of my wife like she's a spear I desperately need to be able to bring down my next mammoth makes me think some pretty shitty things about that desire.  Things I know are bullshit, but that I can't help but think and feel.  Is wanting to look pretty a thought crime?  What about wanting to enjoy something your friends enjoy that you just don't?

"This was such a great video, it did not seem remotely like it was 30 minutes long cause it went by so fast and I was so absorbed in it! You were beautiful before the surgery and are beautiful after the surgery. Also I love your sparkly top (dress?). Anyway, I loved hearing your perspective on beauty. As a cis woman who was never a fan of wearing makeup, I have a weird relationship with the idea of beauty. I have very rarely felt beautiful and the fact that my parents and stepmom all pushed for me to wear start wearing makeup around 14 (an idea I flat out refused because that's what teenagers do- whatever their parents don't want them to do) made me loathe makeup for a long time (it was VERY much a not good 'not like other girls' situation). And now, at 31, when I would love to be able to hide my rosacea and maybe look older than 20 so I can actually be taken seriously...most makeup makes my very sensitive eyes feel like they're burning. Oh the irony. I love the idea of focusing on style instead of beauty though because style feels more like something you can control and make your own.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's not really as complicated as it seems. Everyone, wants to be loved and accepted. Being beautiful gets you that, or the facsimile of that, instantly.

But, as a cis-white woman, I look in the mirror and see my grandfather's jowls. I look at pictures of myself as a child and only see how boyish my looks were, no matter that I was in a dress. There are days I even wonder about getting FFS and if it would finally let me be pretty, if I also lost a lot of weight, too. Beauty standards suck.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"THANK GODDDD I've been waiting for a new video for so loooong. haven't even watched it yet and love it already Edit: Also, thank you for that Sophie song, it fits perfectly  Edit (again): On a more serious note, this video hit me pretty hard. As a gay man who sees a lot of those pretty boy instagays and pays close attention to all the hot male celebrities and general, I have struggled with body image issues years. I rarely think I am attractive and avoid mirrors when I can help it, except when I'm staring at my face/body criticizing it. I feel guilty for caring about my appearance when there are more important things to care about. Its also led to me to have pretty wack eating habits like eating only a couple crackers one day then entire containers of nutella and entire cereal boxes the next, because I decide one day I look terrible and should never eat again and decide the next day not to care because nutella tastes good. I also have a pretty wack exercise schedule for the same reasons, like running ten miles and doing hundreds of pushups every day to no exercise at all. My only problem with this video is your conclusion about making your own style. I have tried this so many times in my life but usually give up out of laziness and the feeling that I don't deserve to look good. It's just this constant cycle of distaste for the way I look. If anyone has any advice, it would be appreciated.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think you're beautiful. Just saying.  You can take this as a sycophantic form of flattery in an ocean of comments of the same strain, but I genuinely think you're gorgeous. I think it's important to iterate that you aren't gorgeous in the same way as these disruptively enchanting Instagram girls. Those little 'bioqueens' embody nubile, youthful and very soft beauty, and that's not the type of beauty you possess. As long as you compare yourself to that type of beauty, there will always be this grating dysphoria. I'm a total hypocrite because I'm trans, 5'9 and have a long face and I do the same! We are of different types of beauty, gorgeously attractive to those who prefer our style of appearance.  Especially when you were in the mirror in that black top, it really brought out your long neck and made you look so elegant and beautiful in a way that transcends the transience of youth. Beautiful in a way that I can envision you at 40, 50 and beyond.  Let's try less to be fuckable (because that fades) and try to be beautiful instead: Feminine, caring, radiant, healthy, well-groomed, good style, graceful, etc. - these don't fade!

"I want to be annoyed and dismissive (it's a shitty instinct and im working on it) and say ok you're thin, white, and can afford to be stylish and people would die to look like you there are people destroying themselves because they don't look like you so stop...BUT there's not a thing external about feeling beautiful. We live in a capitalism and it creates self loathing as an economic principal there will never be an amount of beauty that is 'good enough' we are always flawed. I'm in my thirties now and I actively avoid mirrors because I hate my goddamn everything and I have since about 10 years old but I was looking at old pictures not even that old but like 2 years ago and though 'fuck, I wish I still looked like that'. It's illogical because I hated looking 'like that' because I was too fat too black too queer and not queer enough etc etc. Beauty is the whole Sisyphus thing except there's not really a way to imagine him happy. I honestly don't know how we get past it because even with representation we still only represent those closest to the dominant group.

"I think I understand. When you spend so long focusing on some part of yourself that you don't like, you get into a pattern of obsessive thinking. When you're trans, you're constantly thinking about parts of your body that make you dysphoric. So, even when those parts go away, you've already gotten into a pattern of focusing on these problems and obsessing over ways to fix them. Even if the things that made you dysphoric are gone, you're already in the habit of obsessive thinking. You'll find new issues with your body. It's hard to rewire your brain.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Its normal to want to become what represses you, to be the strong one, hence no longer be the weak one - since beauty is power, wanting to be powerful by being beautiful is very relatable... like feeling like no one would abandon me if I were prettier, or that I would be less disapointing...  I also feel guilty by wanting beauty when I know its a power strugle, and that it represent the things that I hate in society... I also know its a eternal quest, to feel beautiful has to do with so much, and it is cheaper and more guarantied to reflect and try to better the emotional part, like confidence, style, toxic comparison, over criticsim , working with what I got instead of foccusing on being someone else, looking for the best ways to better my stronger features... try to bring pragmatic thinking to balance the emotional roller coaster of being just human in a world of make-belieave majestic queens of angelic unrealistic beauty.

"I want to be beautiful. Beauty is atractive, not just superficially. Beauty makes my heart beat stronger. But I do think that beauty is not constant, it varies an it's different for everyone. I have a friend i find gorgeous, and society (and her) disagree; i get why, but for me her beautiful parts are so beautiful that they compensate the rest.  My tips for feeling beautiful (that i use) are: 1) find details you like about yourself, like your eyes, long lashes, brows, hair, skin color, nails, etc; then add more and more things you like and try to accentuate them. For me it started with liking my eyes and nails. 2) look for people that have the same features as you that you think look good. For example, my face shape (which I don't quite like) is oval, so I try to find oval faces that look good and find resemblances with myself.  I truly don't know if I am good looking or ugly, I'm just guessing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Like, talk to me about a really specific (nerdy) topic that I might have no idea about but would bore most people to tears and you couldn't pay me to lose interest.  I've always wanted an adult to look up to, and I feel like my teachers should be those adults... but I'm a remotely pretty white girl so it's just assumed that I have so much going for me that my teachers don't need to waste their time. I've even had teachers who really looked down on me at first but who do a complete 180 once they hear a bit about the way my life sucks.  I don't get it.

"The whole 'forgiving oneself for wanting to be beautiful' thing reminds me of that line from SharkTale: 'Deep down, I'm really superficial.' This is a sentiment that I've owned for a long time. This idea that physical attractiveness is very important to me, and always will be. It's something I care about the same way people care about someone's taste in art or music. Sort of like a hobby, a little signifier that I'll likely get along with someone. Now, this doesn't mean that I actively dislike people who aren't physically attractive, simply that I value beauty the same way I value art or nature.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The small digs at my weight and larger chest built up quickly and by high school I had been starving myself on and off for years. It took me going to college, being away from the judgement of my family, to realize that my body was fucking amazing and perfectly healthy. I really started to love myself when I was forced to step away from the toxic situation i was living in. There was never anything wrong with me, but that hate was all I had ever known.

It might sounds cheesy but I really have a hard time figuring out if someone is beautiful or not when I don't know them. The only time a stranger seems beautiful to me is if I think they have an unique and cool dressing style or if I think they seem like an interesting individual. I prefer people in real life than on their pictures -- I NEVER find someone more beautiful on a photo than in real life -- because their behavior and manners are whats beautiful to me.

"This video is utterly cathartic. I have been dealing with self image issues since my early teens, and being gay (whose comunity puts a huge emphasis on looks) and deemed nerd/geek/intellectual (whose attitude towards appearance is to scoff at it) created a contradiction within me. Some days I just want to be pretty like those skinny twinks on Instagram, and I feel bad about it, because I also think that's shallow. Some days I wonder, were I handsome I wouldn't be alone and feel loved, yet nobody would fall for an ugly guy. It has been futile to try to reconcile this disparity, and I once even tried to kill myself for such reason. I don't even know what I am doing or should do but perhaps there's some hope for me.

"One tip I've heard recently is to INCREASE your awareness of how beautiful you find other people. Hone in on people you think look pretty, and realize how diverse that group (hopefully) is, and how easy it is for your brain to quickly decide someone has a pretty face. The more you do that, it'll help your brain realize that lots of people will make the same easy, instant judgement of 'pretty' when they look at you. Idk if I worded that great but yeah basically increase your confidence in other people and it'll increase your confidence in yourself because you realize how easy it is to approve of loads of other people, so others must approve of you. (Obviously this idea doesn't work for people who are intensely critical and disapproving of a majority of others and hold EVERYONE to modelesque standards and can't find beauty in passing faces on the street... in which case, folks who think like that don't have any inner beauty anyway :/)... like idk I find it super easy to find people's faces and bodies to be attractive/pretty, and when people put effort into their hair/makeup/outfit then it makes even more of an impact, so, when I go out and I'm wearing an outfit and presenting myself in a way that at least looks like I tried to look nice, I find it a lot easier to accept compliments and feel attractive in the eyes of others because I know there are people who think the same way...?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There are actions people perform not because they intend to but to perform a certain inbuilt purpose. The true reason we do something and the thing that we tell ourselves to justify that thing we're doing is often completely divorced from eachother. So daddy Peterson still has a point where he says makeup is to encourage sexual interest. It can be true at the same time as not being intended to encourage sexual interest.   Likewise you illustrate the point with men claiming to not like makeup while at the same time, only demonstrating that when they dont realise there is makeup.   We're all slaves to our nature, so persuing makeup and beauty can be the reason to suck dick at the same time as getting dick. Primarily, because evolutionary, we've been designed over time to be the best at gathering dicks to suck weather we like it or not.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Hey, here's a really cool secret:  when you're nonbinary, your gender expression is often ONLY style. Throw the gender norms out the window and wear whatever you want, be free. When there's no way to pass as your gender to most people, it really opens things up. I wear a lot of more masculine clothes mixed with floral ties and dangly earrings and sparkly rainbow eye shadow because WHY NOT. So yeah, style > beauty for sure.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Wanting to be stereotypically beautiful is valid. It's also very understandable in our society.  I'd say the vast majority of people wish to be stereotypically beautiful even if they don't admit it.   I will say that a good skincare routine is important. Try stopping for a week and you'll see the difference. Once we get into a good routine and our skin is happy we begin to see it as the new normal and it starts to feel like it's not doing anything, but it is. It helps our skin stay at 100% for years longer than it would naturally.   Anyways, I think you look beautiful both with and without makeup.

"You do realize a large portion of what dysphoria is is a false feeling of being ugly coupled with a feeling of beauty and femininity being tied (society and media made that a thing BTW) and so once you are triggered into a point of being dysphoric, its like many psychological things where you now need to basically overcompensate to get to a neutral, think of the situation where being sad makes things that would make you happy makes you less happy, or whatever, there were YouTube videos about it for a while, it was this big thing, so no, your vision of the girl you are and your vision of the girl you want to be are no longer separable and were not the moment you weren't the girl you are inside, its up to you when to stop tbh, but I hope you can be honest with yourself and those around you as to when you go from one to the other and what is just extra to be beautiful, because its only up to you to decide, and you can even go back and forth, something can be to make you the girl you are, but be done after something to make you the girl you want to be, a artificial standard could be made by taking either the most manly or ugly girl you feel you would be comfortable being (yes its not you, but I just mean if you were suddenly her or born her instead) or the average of all girls in the general group you fit in (ethnocultural?) Now even with hrt, shaving is harder for males than females, and so being that for the most part that is what your body is, then it serves to assume that it is of more benefit to you to have hair removal than for a hormone neutral cis woman to have, and even still you would benefit more from it than a testosterone high cis woman like my mom, though the difference is less, simply put, shaving is hard, and financially for you personally, its likely to be an investment","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Its funny-- I've actually been thinking a lot about beauty and societal beauty standards lately and then along comes your video!  You articulated perfectly what I've been feeling re: being 'woke' and aware of how female beauty standards are the product of years of patriarchy/racism, but how that awareness doesn't change your desires to conform to it.  A point I'd like to add that I find *very* interesting is   a sentiment that I've felt and that I've seen echoed on social media-- how it can be so much easier to find OTHER people beautiful when you start internally critiquing our society's beauty standards, but how you still use those standards very harshly against yourself at the same time.  To use myself as an example: I'm an artist and recently I found a metric shitton of my art from highschool. After I got done cringing, I noticed something. I had mostly drawn white people-- all conventionally attractive and thin. But after I underwent my Leftist Awakening(tm) my art changed. I drew more POC and people with more diverse body-types, because I was now acknowledging the beauty of more than just cis-gendered white people. I can honestly say that I've done a pretty good job dismantling those racist and ableist perceptions about what beauty looks like when it comes to OTHER people. But then I turn to the mirror and take in my mixed-race features and look at my body that used to be 120lbs and is now 200 and think: 'god you're so fat. And look at that frizzy hair and big nose. No wonder you're single'.  I think this unfair double standard comes from a similar place to imposter syndrome-- 'other people are good enough, but *I'm* not.'  The silver-lining of course is that it's just your brain being mean to you and not an objective representation of reality!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"For a while, I went through a phase where physical appearance was something I heavily internalized and unhealthily worried about. I began thinking that there was something wrong with me as to why I've never been in a relationship, and I blamed it on the way I looked - thin, kind of awkward, a slightly misshapen head from a birth accident, glasses, etc. The worst part about it was not the fact that I felt unattractive, and thus unwanted; it was the fact that I *knew* these were unhealthy thoughts that ultimately have no bearing on who I am as a person. Despite that, I couldn't shake it. It especially made me feel bad because I'm a man. You know, in our society, men aren't supposed to care about things like this.  It wasn't until my last year at college where my desires changed - namely, I lost the desire to look attractive. I knew that there was little I could do to change how I looked to other people, no matter how much I cried over it. And being a philosophy student, I was introduced to some profound thinking that had an actual effect on my life and the way I perceived the world. So, for me, the 'critiquing' kind of did lead to a significant change in me. Now that I feel as though there is no way to logically square identity with physical appearance, I've let go from wishing I could look a certain way. Of course, I keep myself well-groomed, but the fact that the way I look has no causal relationship with who *I* am as a being has sort of done away with my self-deprecating outlook.  Do I still feel as though I look ugly? Of course. But it simply doesn't matter to me anymore. In one of your videos, Contrapoints, you ask an important question - which matters more, the way things are, or the way things appear? I believe that the way things are, for who an individual human is, is not the way that human appears physically. And the way things actually are has always tended to matter more to me.  It's a sort of freedom that is hard to describe. I'm not remotely suggesting that people who care about their beauty are wrong - I mean, not only did I do so at one point, but I perfectly understand why people care.  But to be at ease with how I look is a liberating feeling that I don't believe you can get by chasing beauty.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The way you edit, the asides, the random humor; it was always THERE, but again, maybe the surgery really brought that out for some reason. I can't see you as a man anymore. You're totally a chick.  And the sheer INSIGHT as to the daily struggle of women is what I came away with. I had some idea, but FUUUUUCK, now I can't imagine the psychological toll that having to fight these demons takes - all because you want to be beautiful.

"There's so, so much of this that hit home for me, but the moment that took the air out of my lungs was seeing the spectrum outline between makeup levels and reaction from society.  I've been a cis white female in the games industry for about twelve years now, and after my first few years I decided to perform a sort of homegrown study (daily diary over several months) to determine the optimal glam level to avoid negative repercussions at work and reached the EXACT same conclusions you did: Faux natural makeup to avoid being deemed ill, paired with presenting more masculine in dress to avoid accusations of enticement. Be appealing, but not repugnant or 'too cocky' (in a producer's words) I spent way, way too many years of my life mitigating my appearance to satisfy the tiny, feeble egos of my colleagues.  Even now, after deciding to enjoy wearing eyeliner fit to kill a bystander if I feel like it, I'm hyper-aware that presenting as overtly feminine or glam will have any mistake or misstep I make that day as the Smurfette of the office conflated with being vapid, stupid, and unqualified.   I'm lucky enough to work with more evolved colleagues now, but the fear hasn't gone away. Every time I commit to a cat eye in the morning, because I feel like it goddammit, I look in the mirror knowing I can't fuck anything up lest that eyeliner become a red flag by which other women are judged by later.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I dont think influencers can change society's beauty ideals. I personally believe beauty standards come from what privileges the wealthy have and some biological factors of what a fertile woman looks like. For example being pale in asia is seen as attractive because the wealthy work indoors or not at all and spend their time inside so they do not have a tan. In western culture a tan is desirable as it means who has a tan has time to waste just laying in the sun. Having some extra weight 400 years ago was deemed desirable as it means you have plenty of food to eat and can support offspring well. Now being physically fit is seen as attractive as it means you have ample time and money to spend on food and working out. Societal beauty is a mix of biology and wealth like behaviors.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There's definitely a not-like-other-girls flex somewhere in there. I had Not-Like-Other-Girls Syndrome for a solid six or seven years throughout middle and high school, and honestly? I still kinda do. I'm not out of the woods yet. Now, I blame my bitchy elitism on being an aroace chick in a heavily sex-and-romance-oriented society, and I was also 'the smart kid' and 'the artsy kid'. Flexing on other people made me feel better about myself because I had been marinating in sexist societal pressures since infancy, and I had intellectualist passions to drive my ego and go full 'beauty (and by extension, attracting people for romantic purposes) is for normies, I'M an INTELLECTUAL'. Learning that I felt passion for the things I liked, that I actually LIKED them, helped me come to terms with the idea that hey, maybe this is just something they're passionate about. And as I've grown up, I've obtained additional space in my brain for the nuance underneath these issues, the feelings other people have that I don't, and so on.

"You were pretty passing though, and you were beautiful not because you were a girl in a guys body who did some house cleaning and changed the curtains (is that analogy even on the rails??) But because you were a truly beautiful and hot (yes both) human being, and I mean on the shallow not emotional level, and that isn't because you're trans either, that's because you opened windows to what a hot girl really could look like, Adams apple and all, just remember, girls often have many manly traits, often these are subconsciously what people pick up on when seeing them as hot, just look at an average of who is seen as hot, most are more masculine than the less hot girls, people like androgyny, its hot, especially when you are closer to what you present as and identify as, cis or not, BTW I considered you a cis trans girl, and no you don't need to pass for that, just google 'girls with X' and fill in X with whatever bugs you, it helps, now fat girls with small breasts is a thing, and they are seen as hot, but that didn't make me feel much better >< so I'm really bad at taking my own advice, but it at least made me feel valid as a girl, and I think that should go for any trans girl reading this, also trans men, though all the ones I know don't have appearance based dysphoria that much so all I can say is ??men have boobs too??

"I think a large part of your frustration is just downstream from your attempt to remain ideologically pure in favor of social constructionism. The assertion that your desire to be [conventionally beautiful] is simply (or even primarily) a consequence of these [patriarchal western heteronormative pure social constructions] is very likely just adding 'feeling like an idiot drone for buying into this' into the list of what ails you. While I'm not denying outright that there is any element of arbitrary societal influence on what people perceive as beautiful, because that's obviously not true, I do think that this purist leftist position tends to fall apart when it has to contend with any level of objectively unequal or unjust elements of reality. And this criticism of leftist social constructionism is obviously not just limited to conceptions of beauty, it's simply no exception. Look at a lion, or a horse, or a mandarin duck. Most people think those are beautiful animals. Now look at a tapir, a molerat, an anglerfish. You see my point. A revolution doesn't make an anglerfish prettier than a mandarin duck in society's eyes.   That being said, I *do not* think that you're a failure of 'objective' femininity or beauty; you look pretty and you look like a woman. What I'm saying is that I don't just think that your obsession with improving on your vision of yourself is just a consequence of you buying into arbitrary social beauty standards. A revolution isn't just 'not a solution to your problem' because it's 'not feasible,' it's 'not a solution to your problem' because it would make very little difference.   As long as you're still relatively well-off with a good deal of spare time for unhealthy levels of self fixation, with absolutely no real externalized threats or challenges you're actively distracted with overcoming, while having the fundamental baseline dissatisfaction with your objective reality that comes with the territory of transgenderism, I think it's entirely understandable/predictable that you find yourself in this situation. Straight/cis/naturally beautiful/white/rich/healthy people find themselves in these narcissistic death spirals, why shouldn't you? And the fact that you've successfully improved upon your situation with hormones and surgeries in the past just fuels the fire of this fixation, because you have a nagging voice that says 'well what if I just did XYZ minor adjustment' always in the back of your mind.   Anyway, like I said. I think you look good, and you should probably stop with the external changes. The remaining problem is internal, which you've correctly self-diagnosed, I just thought maybe you'd find it helpful to have one less thing to blame for your misfortunes (assuming I've convinced you that your conceptions of beauty are not just socially constructed by Dove in my hastily written YouTube comment, amidst your lifetime conviction to radically leftist positions).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Trigger Warning: Honesty -   I was directed to your channel when your Incels video was the newest. Halfway through the video you brought up that you transitioned, and it caught me completely by surprise, as you completely passed to my eye.  After watching your entire catalog (and while every creator hates their early stuff, I do very much appreciate that you had left those videos up), I could force myself to see the previous face, but it became harder and harder each video (long since impossible now).  But importantly: I honestly believe that every cis person is clockable. Take any cis person that someone doesn't know, and tell them they are trans, and the person will obviously be trans via hindsight bias.  This can be a big problem for trans people, as a cis person getting incorrectly clocked will just pass it off, as it doesn't happen often, but that could ruin a trans person for a long time. Despite the fact that the cis person does not pass anywhere near as well as the trans person.  I, unfortunately, do not have an answer to that (and performing YouTube psychaitry with no background is a dangerous thing). I am curious if purposefully trying to clock aesthetic cis people could help internalize the wide ranges, such that a part your brain is trying to convince you is masculine is actually well within the feminine range. Or that could go horribly awry and make everything worse D:  As far as makeup goes, some of my friends go from a 7 (no makeup) to an 8 (natural makeup), while some go from a 4 to a 9. (Equivalent to the Show-ers vs Grow-ers?) Of course, in public, people make an effort to pretend to be a Show-er, and as such anyone attempting to rate their pre-makeup is going to be heavily biased against themselves.  With that said, in your Incels video, you were a solid 8+, and only increased since. Of course, despite my warning of honesty earlier, I am sure your brain will try to convince you that I am pandering, but as a wise JaidenAnimations once said: 'It's ok, stop it!'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Then I feel self-conscious about feeling self-conscious because men aren't suppose to really care that much about their weight, at least not like I do. Then you feel self-conscious about exercising with other people around because people generally see overweight people exercising as humourous. Society is a minefield, however I'm sure it is more like a minefield of hydrogen bombs for trans women given the kind of standards society puts on the female appearance; and that women should be beautiful all while not caring about their appearance.

"I'll be honest, I thought you looked better before your surgery. But I'm also bisexual and like tomboyish and butch women and femme man, also in general a more androgynous look, so maybe I'm not the best one to ask. Also what matters is that you look beautiful to yourself. You don't have to justify looking good to others, you ave to justify it for yourself. For me, it is wanting to look like someone I find good looking. I'm simply too lazy to actually make that happen. I don't know what your inner motivation for looking good is, and you seem like you don't know yourself. But i n my opinion, all you need as a reason is that it satisfies your inner desire for style and beauty. It's like justifying why you want to live in a good looking house. You do it because you like it. The way I see it, vanity is the least superficial reason to want to be beautiful. Wanting to be beautiful for beauty's sake, rather than equation it with other tangentially related qualities.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Then, after months of loving my body and the time freed up by not shaving, I started thinking I needed to shave and questioning myself when I put on a perfectly fitting sleeveless dress in a thrift store.

"Miss Wynn,  We could have a drawn out conversation about fate, in which I mention how this video was uploaded 6 days before I am to get FFS, and that it has given me the opportunity to hear a voice of representation, of well-educated middle-class transness that isn't coming from my own mouth. But instead of fate, I think it is a lot more interesting to discuss choices.   I'm a rising sophomore at an 'elite' university, and this past semester I ruminated over the fact of my peers receiving cushy grants and stipends to travel the world, participate in prestigious internships, fulfilling community service etc., while I had to answer their earnest inquiries into my summer plans with 'welllllll um yeah no thats so cool! and Im getting, like, plastic surgery. :)' Fortunately, rumination is a great means to the end of self acceptance, I've found, ironically enough.  I've been made to question why 'millimeters of bone,' as you put it, are taking priority over world travel and cultural enrichment. And the truth is, it might honestly be a bad decision. But ultimately, its just that, a decision. Who is to say that this surgery would make me feel any more or less close to a more pure experience of the beauty of life than, say, backpacking through the alps with a $5k grant to spend on nice chocolate and Ubers to and from tinder dates? Life is about experiencing, and thats what I'll be doing this summer. I'll be experiencing surgery, pain killers, swelling, anesthesia, post-op depression, loving concern from friends and family etc. I'm pushing the boundaries of what constitutes an appropriate use of an oh so precious summer just as my friend who is being paid to bartend in Berlin and blog about it is.  AS A TRANS WOMAN I have faced immense pressure to conform to beauty standards, which has contributed to mental and physical health threats that most others do not experience to the same degree. I can acknowledge that FFS won't put me any more onto the path of self acceptance than throwing away my mirrors or scoffing at less educated or less privileged transpeople in a futile attempt to inflate my own sense of worth will. Do I feel proud about my decision. No. Really, I don't feel anything. I have one life, I might as well pursue 'beauty.' Who is going to stop me, and, more importantly, why does it matter?  Thank you for editing down the last few contemplative months, in which my feelings of guilt, privilege, fear, vapidity, and eager excitement have brewed into a thoroughly opaque lack of feeling, into a 30 minute video that I somehow do not feel has in any way pandered to the majority-cisgender demographic of your audience. Representation matters, especially when that representation is the very thing tackling the existentialist, eurocentrically standardized (I know the wording on that one was a reach), capitalist prologue to the reconstruction of my skull. For when hamlet held up that skull in that play thingy written by that one guy, did he not say something along the lines of 'to be be beautiful, or to ignore my dread at looking at a candid pic in profile, that is the question.'

"wow, so many feels. As an AFAB genderqueer enby who leans towards the masc/androgynous look, I have thought A LOT about beauty vs style. I used to think I was just an ugly woman, or that I was just bad at being a woman, but since i have a lot of aesthetic appreciation for traditionally femme things (nails, makeup, sparkles, floral, etc.), I must just be not trying hard enough. So I tried. I leaned in, I bought (and stole, thanks capitalism) makeup, I wore dresses that required push up bras and tights, I curled and straightened and teased and sprayed my hair (even though I've always had a sensory issue with having product in my hair). I liked what I saw and I thought that was worth it. But it became a thing that I HAD to do, even to go to the store, and as soon as I was sure I didn't have to go out again, I would take it off.  Around that time I had two AFAB friends who came out as nonbinary and started experimenting with various nontraditional styles. One took testosterone, stopped wearing makeup, and started wearing more masc clothes. another started binding and later got top surgery, but continued to play with makeup and wear sparkles and paint their nails. I was FASCINATED. I became *THE BEST* ally I could be, lurking in groups, reading articles, defending nonbinary people at every step. Seperately to that but sort of concurrently, the pain I had been feeling in my feet and knees for years finally became unbearable and I stopped trying to dress up and go out. I hobbled down the stairs each morning and wore pajamas or leggings and t shirts most of the time. I stopped wearing my underwire bra because it seemed like there was no point if I wasn't going to go all the way and I had always hated it anyway. My bike broke and I didn't replace it the next summer. I was pretty miserable and gained a lot of weight (I've always been heavy, but had been able to find looks i thought worked on me, but this was the heaviest I've ever been and I didn't like the way I looked at all). I was convinced by family to see a foot doctor and was given custom orthotics. I had been wearing knock off doc marten boots or ballet flat style shoes for years and I had to buy what i thought were ugly athletic shoes (I was like 'im not an athlete, i look like a poser). But i tried to wear them every day around the house and i started to feel relief. I could finally go for walks again. I started riding a bike again. I was so happy to be independent again, I stopped thinking about how i looked to other people and started dressing for comfort and practicality. I wore a lot of cut offs and my husband's hand-me-down t shirts and button ups, and I started to experience something I had never felt before. I felt like I could look good and not feel like I was wearing a costume. That's when I came out, first as demigirl, then genderfluid, then finally genderqueer, which is how i've been identifying for a couple years now. I now feel more comfortable mixing in elements of femininity without having to 'put on a woman costume'. Instead of seeing my wide jaw and square face as something that made me look ugly, I now kind of appreciate them in a different way. I look at them as cute from a masc perspective instead of as signs i'm just an ugly woman. *I'm NOT saying trans/nonbinary folks should just accept their faces the way they are. If contouring or FFS is what you want to do, go for it. I just find it so interesting that features that are gendered (jaw width, forehead size) can be either beautiful or ugly depending on what look you're going for.  I'm glad you were able to access a surgery that you wanted and that you're happy with the results. I doubt you'll read this far, but if you do, for what it's worth, I find you very attractive. I do happen to be a pansexual enby who finds masculinity and femininity attractive, and who thinks you were pretty hot before your transition, and who has a specific thing for tall bossy women, so take that as you will. But fandom and exaggeration aside, I think you are a very pretty woman, and I'm glad you're still making these videos.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Also not to be the person who double comments but I feel this a lot. I met someone who was surprised that I was trans recently, he said 'the more you know.' I got confused when my Uber driver was surprised that I was gay because I thought was too feminine enough in looks and mannerisms  to pass in general. I thought my voice was too effeminate to be 'straight passing.' I look at the bodies of (presumably) cis men who are my height and close to my weight, who have a bone structure similar to mine and they read 'male.' I look at myself and I think 'female,' despite the fact that I haven't been clocked in a while. But that's not what it is... it's not that I don't think I look like a man (I don't, but other people think I do) it's that I don't think I look like the man that I could have looked like. I can say with an amount of certainty that if I had been born cis, or gotten puberty blockers if I was faster to realizing that I was trans, and had a better family, I would look different. I would look more like the person that I think I'm supposed to look like. A person that at this point is unattainable even with surgery. It's rough, but it's a reality that a lot of us have to face, and self acceptance is it difficult but necessary Road...","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm only 18.5 minutes in, but as a cis woman with likely body dysmorphia, history of disordered eating, family abuse regarding weight and appearance, I have thoughts. This is something I've spent lots of time (and therapy) reflecting on. My last therapist would ask me, often, why I want to be pretty. I don't even know. But what I do know, and perhaps you address it later in the video, is that I don't necessarily think that fans are liars and haters just want to hurt you, I think it's also that when we like people, we see them as more attractive, not just liking attractive people. I have even found myself rationalizing my personality, in darker questioning moments - am I a nice person simply bc it's one of the only ways I can get other people to think i'm pretty? So I think people who like you, who appreciate your content and personality, literally see a different person than those who don't. If the most artistically talented among us were to render your image, there would be different outcomes. I've even found this with celebrities that I may have not found attractive at first, but learned something of their personality and later saw them as more attractive, and vice versa. Like I said, this is something I've been thinking about at length for probably 20 years, or more, and it's become only more complicated as I now have an elementary age daughter who looks more than a little like me. That is a whole new challenge. So I appreciate this video, I always appreciate your view point and observations.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm quite sure this may end up in the pits of hell. Meaning it probably won't be seen by the author of the video. The lobster queen herself.     Although I do not deal with gender dysphoria, I have a mild (mild since it was addressed and treated with therapy) case of Body dysmorphia. It stems from different sources or problems that I know are potentially exaggerated and I so wish I could vanish them.  But even after having spent time and money for the issues to be treated, I still don't really feel I'll finally get to love myself and think my aesthetic is ideal or acceptable.   The issue no longer causes me pain, but its ongoing existence is a rather annoying burden.    Beauty is my curse for I aim to be like the individuals that exude confidence and possibly wake up in the morning feeling that they can take a picture without thinking they need to fix their entire face.  And although I have don't have reason to complain, because I'm kinda like above average, I feel way more trapped because, well, I have standards for myself and they ought to be met one day. Please God.    Anyway, I want to say thank you for having made this video.  One of the fabulous branches of philosophy I enjoy the most is aesthetics. Understanding beauty under different lenses, be it artistic, social, evolutionary, you name it.. is eye opening and it's oddly intoxicating.   I wish for you to know that, according to my eye, you look wonderful and the surgery simply brings a refreshing and youthful look to your face. I'm happy for you.   Props for the video, and let's keep compensating by being style icons as well <3","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thing is, so many people assume just because you're smart you don't also have a desire to look pretty. Yes bitch, I can talk about global warming and how time is entropy while putting on my foundation it doesn't matter. For me beauty is always something I do for myself, when I look good I feel good and when I feel good I do good, which is why when I have to study for a subject I like to wear an outfit I would wear to go out.  However, there's something that really pisses me off and that's when people start talking about things they can't control such as stretch marks and cellulite (and also weight gain, women tend to gain weight when on their periods and lose if after). For me beauty is for ME and me only, it's a private thing, so it really bothers me when people try to publicize it. My friends talking about how fat they are bothers be because it never bothered me before until I was constantly surrounded by people who said that stuff. What I ate and how I looked was a personal experience and suddenly everyone around me was talking about it and it bothered me because they kept feeding into this idea that to be beautiful you have to have big eyes, be tall and have a large bust.  And okay, fair enough, you can talk about your insecurities but maybe people should think more before criticizing themselves because there's always going to be a younger more impressionable person listening.  And besides, everyone dies. No ones going to remember the time you forgot to shave, everyone's too insecure about themselves to be thinking about you. You have one body, and one body only, you should be content with what you have. It's totally fine to try and improve it, you should do whatever makes you feel happy! But the key thing is it should be for YOU and not because society told you that big noses are a no no or that your jaw isn't sharp enough.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It's also very empowering because she refuses to give in to the 'not like other girls' pressure. Highly recommend giving it a second look, I found it surprisingly inspiring.

Because that sacrifices piece of the conversation. And you know how much criticism thats going to get you, but if everything else hasn't stopped you already, why should a little more criticism? Theres a lot of faces with bone structure that ring a dopamine bell in my head every time. And thats great. But I feel less helpless when your face changes the shape of something in my mind. When you describe the struggle of a thought I've tried to detangle for years as if its plain as day to you. And when you talk, it is.

It looks like I'm going to have to work for three years as an Ubereats courier to afford that.  Even more difficult is the fight against my inner demons. Friends, communities, acceptance, family.

The way people interpret my gender based on my appearance is something I think about a lot. I used to love wearing earrings, but now I feel that it reads too feminine so I never wear them any more. The concept of a curated style as a response to the pressure of social beauty standards seems to wrap up the issue neatly. Even if I can't conform to what I think others will find beautiful, I feel encouraged to pursue my sense of style as a genuine representation of what I find visually attractive, no matter how it correlates to gendered beauty standards","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There are two main types of feminine beauty. The first relates to features that appeal to men who are attracted to signs of child-bearing. This explains the popular over exaggerated hour-glass figure on instagram models. This kind of beauty evolved around reproduction.  The second and more powerful type of beauty is about transcendence. The desire to be this kind of beautiful and the desire to be enlightened, talented, and famous have common roots.  They all relate to transcending the norm and reaching a level that is super-natural. That's why this kind of beauty is more about BEING than ATTRACTING, and would explain why women put on make up in a vacuum. This type of beauty will always be a source of discontentment because it will always evolve to a different standard depending on what is rare and hard to achieve. Unlike the first type, this seeks to transcend time and physicality altogether. This is why runway models lack child-bearing features. It's more about power and status than reproduction. In fact, this neotenous type of beauty rejects reproduction altogether while presenting the ideal of youth without end.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I find this a bit odd, because I feel beautiful most of the time and maybe have a few days here and there where I do not. I do not use the filters that change your shape or what not, but do change lighting in pictures with filters. I apply make up with a regular mirror that I can hold. I do not sit in front of a mirror and do not look at myself for hours. I also do not like taking more than 20 minutes to a half an hour applying make up, usually less time. Sometimes I will not wear make up at all and sometimes I will only wear mascara and lipstick. If I wear more make up I use the colors to express how I feel and I occasionally apply literal bodypaint if I am feeling extra expressive. What is so strange about this is, is that if we are comparing basic societal beauty standards then you are probably considered far more perfect than I would be. Yet, somehow, I feel awesomely attractive most of the time! And am not lacking in choice. And I am 40. WTF is this now?!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I liked your 'mix of flamboyance, darkness and mish-mash' style, both when you were in the wrong body and after. Can't say if it was necessarily healthy (for you), but it was definitely appealing, and I think it's still there. I must say though, I might have to get used to this new Natalie's face. As with the style, there was a certain 'something' about your previous face, maybe an air of confidence, fake or not, or the uniqueness, or my secret inner gay, or maybe (and most likely) even just the habit of seeing you like that, that made it more appealing... BUT, I think it's just a matter of getting used to it, and in the mean time if it did good for you, for your self-image and empowerment, then that's all that should matter, right? Right? And if rationalizing being a slave to the systems you try critique helps you cope, all the more power to you; anyone who tells you they don't on any level are grade-A bullshitters. Still, be careful, the battle for The Beauty Standard is neverending, and while learning to accept that you like to be beautiful without punishing yourself for it may get rid of the 'academic guilt', it will do nothing to stop the crippling feeling of 'it's not enough! IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH!!' (and the time investment).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think lesbians, butch ones especially, have a very complicated relationship with beauty.   I'm a butch lesbian, and I try my hardest to look sexy, but I sometimes feel restricted by arbitrary nonsense. I can't wear makeup, because that's feminine and it makes me feel bad about myself. I can't wear clothes from women's sections, because I feel uncomfortable, even though they fit me better. My jawline will never be sharp and square, unless I get work done.   I know quite a few lesbians who have this complicated relationship with beauty, because it's like we're actively fighting the male-gaze beauty standards. So butch lesbians often fall into the trap of never being able to get beauty right, since the goals are often made up by the person, and thusly can fluctuate.   I cut my hair, I wear sports bras and boxers, I shop exclusively in men's sections, but at the end of the day I often feel like I will never be handsome. I hate my height and how small my feet are, but those are things I can't change. Beauty, for butch lesbians, is often the hardest thing to deal with. Unless you look naturally androgynous, of course.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Or beautiful? It's a pretty standard desire to have and yet these days it's become so ostracized to feel that way. If you feel stunning without all the make up, hair and clothes I think that is absolutely incredible but likewise there is also nothing wrong with putting in that time and effort in order to feel that way.

"It bothers me that the things you mentioned about wanting to look beautiful, even being aware and critiquing how the idea of it has been molded by various outside forces, hits so close to home. It bothers me because I'm a cis hispanic male that carries all the baggage that comes with that upbringing and it saddens me that these issues go beyond the labels/backgrounds. I also want to look beautiful; I get so anxious before I go out that I have to set aside 2 hours minimum before I leave the house and change shirts too many times, among other things. All that effort just to look back in the mirror and feel ugly anyway. Makes me avoid going out at all since it's so damn exhausting.  I also take comfort in the pain though because it reaffirms my understanding that there are aspects of life we can all share in the joys and pains of, regardless of background and we can all find common ground instead of the tribalism that is firing on all cylinders lately.  Though those specific life circumstances and influences that are innumerable shouldn't be disregarded either. They are also important in trying to develop comprehensive understanding and solutions.   Fuck it, I'm with you on the idea of just wanting to focus on the aesthetics and not the apocalypse.

"as a cis white man this...actually hit me. I actually care way too much about my beauty sometimes. Some days I say fuck it and I wear eyeliner and eye shadow smudged to fuck or for a few days in a row all grungey, other days i do give a fuck and im crying at my goddamn cheekbones. The more I look in the mirror to apply my makeup, the more often I notice facial features and care about my appearance. I like wearing makeup and I couldnt care less what it looks like sometimes, but the more I apply it in the mirror the more conscious I become about my face etc.  I know this is trivial in comparison to others, i know im not..un attractive (i hope). Got a beautiful Girlfriend who loves me and thinks I'm attractive and I know she sees me and doesn't really care what i look like, but even then its not enough sometimes and I need to feel beautiful and look attractive, I get self conscious about what strangers think about me, friends, family, classmates etc.   But this is also incredibly difficult, when your own personal beauty standards etc do not align with the norm anyway. So things that make me feel attractive are not attractive to others etc.  I think what Im trying to say here is: drunk cis man rambles about beauty standards suck but they effect us all no matter how much we try to avoid them. Also makeup fun, i want my eyes on fleek in the revolution","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm a straight guy and I have the same feeling when I look at myself in the mirror - I have a really hard time judging myself (I wonder if this is a common thing? I've never asked anyone). It used to bother me when I was younger, which probably had to do with being bullied at school and being generally really insecure through most of my teens. But since then I've come a long way in self-esteem and these days the mirror-emptiness doesn't cause me anxiety, as long as I look vaguely presentable. But it does mean that I can't evaluate changes to my appearance, so I always just regress back to the mean for familiarity's sake. On one hand it's kinda liberating, but on the other I always wonder what it would be like to have a vision of how I want to look, some sense of style. Appearance as a means of expression has always been a bit alien to me, I've got nothing to express in that medium. Anyway it's cool to know I'm not the only one who has the mirror thing.   P.S. it might not mean much coming from me, possibly the least style-conscious entity in the known universe, but you look great with or without makeup. Also I have a hard time believing that any of your critics would doubt your womanhood if they didn't already know who you are. They're just working backwards from the fact that you're trans to imagine evidence that isn't there.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I decided years ago that as a disabled and a fat woman (in a chair, so I get lots of pity looks), that I was going to go the style route. And it works for me, it really does, but I still get upset about not being able to meet societal beauty standards.   There's also the fact that an extremely set type of style (in my case rockabilly and vintage) takes away from those pity looks- I want to be remembered as that rockabilly chick with the victory rolls, not the fat chick in a wheelchair. And there's also the possibility that as I'm a fat chick in a wheelchair, I feel that I'm not holding up my end of femininity, not being the pleasing objet d'art that is my role as a woman. And so, if I doll myself up in an individual and unique (ish) way,I'm making up for that? It's really complicated.   So yes to style, but it certainly doesn't fix the issue (as you pointed out).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Your disphoria, your fights against climate change, racism, fatphobia: none of them matter as they pale in comparison to the true plights of this world. They matter, but not that much.

"That was                                EPIPHANY !!! Better than orgasms. Yours 'style' concept is (opinion) precisely what we need to build personality, to end conflict. Beauty is a biological conflict device to push animals ( humans) into natural competition and selection. But we do not need that at thise stage, humanity had the first 'singularity': culture; our bodies are not evolving faster than our scientific capabilities to shape the fisical world, we do not have to subject to fisical darwinism. So daddy Peterson does not understand Darwin's evolution theory, most people don't (they think they do).  Beauty does not exist as a constant, search for 'lotus feet', that's the bauty device I've mentioned. Beauty is an variable, and if it is not unethical, it is ok to enjoy it, like drugs and sex; also the moderation factor to not kill yourself.  There is also the second kind of beauty, contemplation; it is pure affection and sympathy. Mothers have this contemplation for their children (not always, a tragedy), and it's the golden gift of true friends and lovers, they will contemplate your existance and manifestations in this world no matter what happens to your body. We need ethical standards, and shifting them is not instantaneous, but politically quick, like fashion trends or getting in to a new sexual fetish, insist on the 'style' and will change the standard, not from a capitalist  social high hierarchy position, but from an artistic position. It is already working, I  now apreciate the beauty of all races, before feminism and antiracism, only hollywood movie whyte blondes.  (all my opinion, not facts) Sometimes CP is better than cocaine !

"*Beauty is such shit.* As someone who was utterly hideous and bullied to psychological shambles for my entire life and have become only slightly above average, I can attest to the fact that being even somewhat physically attractive alleviates little to no inner turmoil. The most that has changed is that I don't really feel like I need plastic surgery but that also might have just been getting used to feeling hideous. I still feel ugly even if I've been complimented before. More importantly, even when I do feel attractive, when I feel I've gotten to that point in my appearance which I longed for when I was horribly bullied every single day of my life, now, I just feel... empty. And that wasn't what I expected to feel after being someone who incessantly prayed to God, or--after I dropped that bitch like a stone--would post images of myself on online forums and look at myself for literal hours in the mirror and felt literal existential dread.  I swear to God I hate this wild goose chase that capitalism has us on to feel the sense of meaning it's taken from us. Some sense of satisfaction in a system that doesn't want you to. The beauty industry is a damn behemoth and even in the effort of liberation of men from their gender expectations, it's only grabbing us into the shit women have had to deal with forever. At this point, late-capitalism feels like the void itself.  It'll engulf our planet beyond repair and the human soul along with it. *Fuck capitalism.* And _THAT'S_ the true tea, sis.

Was my anorexia a manifestion of gender dysphoria? was it because I'm DFAB and women face a lot of pressure to keep their weight down? is the pain I feel when I see myself dysphoria (valid) or internalized fatphobia (not valid)  these are questions that haunt me all the time and I don't think there's a clear answer","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Since I was eleven Ive cried myself into oblivion looking at my face in the mirror. I never felt like a pretty girl until I figured genderqueer was a thing u can be and it alleviated sm pain. I wasn't a woman and that's why I could never feel like one. But I still take 10-15min videos of myself  and 'acting natural' and then watch them over and over and usually cry bc some unsymmetrical facial feature. And I know this is an ugly obsessive behavior and by doing it I'm just going to hate myself and start judging others the same way but it doesn't stop me bc some part of me still believes that beauty is completely objective either you're in or you're out and I'll NEVER be in. However at this point i know the real reason is bc beauty is power and I want ppl to listen to me and do what I say yikes (side note so much of the crying and hatred stopped when I accepted myself as non-binary so s/o gender visibility on the internet) thank u for the video [?]","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I'm cisgender, but I find watching your 'journey' so cathartic. Even though I'm not trans, I find myself somewhat jealous of your evolution. That probably sounds so privileged, and I'm sorry for that . . . but here me out.  There is so much about my life and body that I either regret or otherwise wish to change. Seeing someone--seeing you--take that first step (and those later steps) and working so hard to become who you can be is beyond inspiring.  I often fantasize about abandoning those parts of my life I don't like and starting anew. I am, sadly, a bit of a coward and so afraid of failure that oftentimes I recoil at opportunities to change because of that fear. Your courage and willingness to affirm yourself in a way that is much more drastic than anything I would ever consider doing is something I wish I had the fortitude to do.

"When I was a teenager, I used to be really fat. And dreamed about being thin beautiful. A Lot. Then a condom broke and plan b didn't work and I ended up having a kid at 19 yrs old (abortion Is not legal where i live). I was a depressed pregnant teen, and a deeply depressed recent mother. And I was thin. Finally thin. Skinny thin. Never been so miserable. So I got to a point where there was no escape from me and how I treated myself. But, even after years of therapy, i still crave not just beauty but everything asociated with it. There Is other way to change society and It's education. Where i live, one of the axes of Sex Ed Is related to body image, beauty and self care, encouraging diversity and style above social pressure.

"This video made me confront my face blindness bc I didn't realize what had happened and I map recognition to silhouettes and colour more than minor facial proportions... Can see it when I look for it though! Love the breakdown as usual  I will also say, going from the rigid beauty standards of women, to the...???... Of men.... Has been a very disorienting thing. A lot of the traits that made me unattractive as a woman now aid my passing extremely (muscular, big cheek and jaw bones, larger hands and feet, broad shoulders, big trapezoid muscles, small downward pointing breasts set wide on large pecs). I'm so used to defining myself as ugly based on these that I find myself still wishing I looked like models on occasion despite the fact that, in reality, looking like that, existing in that shape would be dysphoric hell. But I still feel like I can't be beautiful to people without it. And I desperately want to be beautiful, no matter that it's never been achievable for me. I am glad that sometimes I can offer a counterpoint to trans lady friends who hate themselves for similar traits, because, that's... What some cis women just look like. We're so used to only seeing a tiny fraction of how female bodies look that not only do people have no concept of the variety, they actively don't see those who don't fit. I went from being totally invisible as a mildly disappointing lamp to a human being. I kind of dread the dissonance of what might happen if I lose weight. I don't want to have to confront just how much less of a human being I seem like to people and have to wonder, which of those I know after, would turn on me if I reverted?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Got to say, your video was doing pretty well until you said something to the effect of 'If women were to be wearing makeup to attract men, then they'd stop wearing it when men weren't around.'  Honestly, this is a comment so below you're intellect its embarrassing, and I've never heard you say something so flippant. It honestly sounds like the argument 'if evolution were true, then why are there still monkeys?'   First, there's no reason to think that evolution is a rational process. There's no reason to think that women wear makeup because they are *consciously* trying to attract a mate. There are a whole host of animals that do such things, and there's not (usually) any reason to think that they're rationally thinking 'if I ruffle my feathers in this particular way I'll be more desirable.' There's just no reason to think that there wearing makeup or caring about appearance isn't instinctual in some way.   Second, you go on to suggest that women wear makeup in prison because they're trying to 'feel feminine.' Now, that might be true, but there's no reason to think that women aren't establishing some sort of hierarchy based off their appearance. Again, if you think that this has to be consciously thought, then you should read the above paragraph.  Honestly, I wouldn't be so embarrassed for you if you weren't so flippant about it. If only you would have said there are multiple reasons and evolutionary psychology is incredibly complex, I would have agreed with you. But its like you're hostile to this idea and you didn't give it the credit you typically do.  And I guess that's the point, I hope this comment ends up being constructive for you because I feel that you're a great thinker that I have respect for.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Anyone who says they're immune to the hateful attacks - especially the personal ones - is lying to themselves.

"i'm glad this came out. how we look is as important as music, visual arts and other forms of aesthetics and expression. while external beauty standards should be fought and I think it's possible in the short-medium term to take those out (maybe except for certain forms of disability) even if you account for those or look within a single group you still see a hierarchy and trends for preferences. what we also need to fully invalidate the hierarchy is genuine anti aging technology and improved/abundantly accessible body modification/plastic surgery. if being beautiful is easy and common, and you know everyone looks how they want (even if they don't change their looks at all) then the hierarchy is redundant and it becomes an enjoyable and artistic thing. I also think many leftists like to pretend that dating is a meritocracy and looks preferences aren't a big deal but for many it really is. Logically, many people know that appearance based preferences just make dating harder, but it's not something that goes away.

"it's a little weird to me that nat says the reason women in academia or anywhere don't wear makeup is to be masculine or 'not like other girls' and not because make up is work and an expense and a skill not everyone wants, intrinsically, to do? Why is NOT covering your face in paint masculine. Why is masculine the default state of skin. If make up is not part of your personal 'style' or aesthetic, is that masculine? Why is doing nothing masculine? These are serious honest questions from someone who feels like some kind of alien watching this.  I don't understand how im supposed to know what gender i am. I am physically so far off from my ideal aesthetic and honestly if we were really picking, I probably wouldn't want any of the weird flesh mech human skin options at all. So maybe I've just given up and that's why i don't get it.   But my choice not to wear make up unless its painting on a face to go pretend to be a Functional Human has nothing to do with masculinity or being not like other women. whatever that even means.  sorry. It was a fun video, as always, nat, but i guess this is just another part of Functional Humanity they didn't program into my brain","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The ending especially really struck a chord with me. I think the thing that helped me the most in my transition was playing a Roegadyn in FFXIV. The fact I had the opportunity to play such a *huge* woman, with broad shoulders, narrow hips, and strong facial features, really influenced my self-image as a trans woman. They were able to look so goddamn hot while also being 7'2' and muscular was the sort of representation I really needed.

"So I stopped getting carded at bars last year and it honestly bothered me. And then it bothered me that it bothered me. I literally thought, 'Lord, I'm losing my ingenue appeal QUICKLY and I don't know what I'll do without it' and then felt like barfing about it. It's almost like all those years I spent being the ugly duckling and cultivating an actual personality just flew out the window when puberty finally fucking blessed me with its end. And then I feel like I'll never get those brain cells back, as much as I try to convince myself that beauty and brains aren't a dichotomy or zero-sum.   But then I look at you and other women and I KNOW instantly that you're beautiful, and I don't understand either why I just can't do the same for myself.

"so i guess if we're here that means we all like natalie's 'taste' :)   but in all seriousness, this is excellent (like always) and i think there's a critique of 'cancel culture' buried in here. not just the whole 'x person is problematique, x person is cancelled' but the way that people try to reject a social construct that, individually, cannot be rejected. like people who go dumpster diving to resist engaging in capitalism. i mean, sure, if it makes you happy, but for one thing: you refusing to participate in a social construct doesn't cancel that social construct. and two: these are the kinds of people who then turn around and criticize people for engaging in that social construct, claiming they're not 'woke' enough. like natalie says, you can be plenty woke, but you can still engage in a 'problematic' social construct, either for personal reasons or because the social construct is simply too big for one person to change or dismantle. wearing make-up might support the patriarchy and capitalism or whatever, but it can also support a person's self-worth and self-expression, and rejecting a social construct doesn't make it stop existing. even the rejection of a social construct is, in a way, engaging with it.   the best we can ever do is be mindful, be subversive, and pursue happiness while trying not to do active harm to ourselves or others.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Natalie alludes to the equation of beauty to youth a few times and so I'm curious if the dissatisfaction people find with their own personal beauty comes from a fear of death. If youth is some sort of timer that runs out and then we die and beauty is a sign of youth then maintaining beauty is like subconsciously fighting off death. Maybe the feeling of never being pretty enough comes from a dissatisfaction with life, like you feel like you haven't reached your potential yet and so you're trying to win more time at your shot at being happy. That's all just conjecture from me though, I don't know shit.    I hope you all feel beautiful today. You've done a great job, appreciate your work.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"100% of the reason I wear make up is to protect myself from self attack should I catch an unflattering glimpse of myself or someone says something even mildly critical. The reason for my dysphoria is trauma, and learning to cope with that trauma at a young age by self attacking to the point where I hated myself so much that I thought Id be doing the world a favor if I killed myself. All this was still easier and less painful than confronting the real pain, and so my brain put up a wall completely separating the ideas. Bad things happened to me, and also I was ugly and worthless and should die, I thought, and it was very difficult to see that I felt that way BECAUSE of the bad things because the entire thing was a defense mechanism and my brain just doubled down under any self reflection. Thats why its painful to hear you realize you too are doing this defense (nothing makes you feel pretty enough even when you do things to be pretty) and decide the solution is to apply this to more people. Because you KNOW it doesnt matter what you look like. You KNOW you've had a flourishing career even while feeling ugly and that you have friends and people who want to be with you. You KNOW that outside yourself no one truly gives a shit how perfect you look. It is 100% not actually about how you look and actually about what youre running from.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Baby girl, this anxiety about beauty and never feeling good enough... Welcome to the club! You will invalidate whatever I say because of whatever anyone else says so it feels futile to even bother but, here's food for thought if you bother to hear me. I was fat. Always fat, my whole life. I spent all my time obsessed with how perfect my life would be if I was just skinnier. Then, I finally learned about calories and lost 100 pounds. I just knew if I was thin, everyone would love me. I'd get anyone, any job, anything I wanted if I was only thinner. Then, I lost my DD tits and stared at my flap jacks where my gorgeous big titties used to be in the mirror. Then I'd turn around and see my slimmer hips and flat ass. Then I'd just cry to my therapist about how nothing is ever just good. Men were suddenly less respectful and now aggressive at the gas station (I guess they figured fat me could kick their ass but thin me was defenseless). It was nothing I spent my whole life fantasising about. My point is, I think you're beautiful now and I thought you were beautiful then. You're going to get caught in a big tangled mess if you don't realize that you're the woman you are, were all different, we all look different. We're not a thing that fits into a cookie cutter and you'll find yourself surpassing a point of passing and going into a realm of looking like a stereotype of what a woman is based on nonsense. I'm happy for you to have this surgery and like I said, you're beautiful but try to see that because it's never going to be enough in your mind and then when do you get to be happy? It comes from loving yourself as who you are and who you are is beautiful. My mom died because of this toxic logic. She had gastric bypass because she dreamed of being this beautiful, skinny Stepford wife. It killed her in the end. She was beautiful. She looked like Linda Carter. She wasn't even heavy enough to qualify for the surgery so she saved up the money to pay a doctor under the table. She didn't need it and it's sad to me that she died never knowing how beautiful she really was. My best friend and I decided at her funeral we would always be willing to say we're BEAUTIFUL despite society conditioning us to never believe that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I'm nowhere near that being a financially viable option, and many people tell me I don't need it, but I can't really reconcile the fact that I only feel quite right in a select few sets of circumstances and otherwise just worry about being perceived as manly or unattractive.

"If your serious and want brutal honestly I can give you an honest impression of your looks. I'm not lying and I have no motive to do so.  You look very feminine you looked feminine before FFS but this has made you look more feminine, We see you mostly in portrait however so I suspect your surgery altered your face in profile more so it's difficult for me to comment about that.  Prior to your FFS there were some slight 'masculine traits' but by my reading you were still placed firmly in the 'female' distribution for facial features.  Honestly if you are 'clocked' horrible term it's probably due to ques from your voice and was never from your face or body really... Your voice dose sound slightly 'synthetic' I know this is no fault of yours and it is a testosterone disfigurement, but when initially listening to you,  you do hear it... you quickly learn to move past it however and you stop noticing it's sound and accept it as natural for you. (This is how contra sounds) it's a distinctive voice when I hear you speaking on other streams ect.  Now stop worrying your pretty. And prettier than me.  If your curious I am one of those Graduate PHD girls I'm also a transgirl too although I did transition in my early 20's although now I'm the same age as you... In my case I don't ever ware makeup, nor did I get FFS (So good shout) when I see myself I rarely think I look 'good' I think I look 'Fine' or 'meh' most of the time. Honestly you are prettier than me.   When I first transitioned I was also swallowed up by a nervous anxiety to be 'pretty' for me this passed gradually over time as I found myself passing in social circumstances and my friends just accepted me as I was just an ordinary girl student at the time. I found myself valid thus I felt less of a push to make myself ever more 'feminine'.  When I see myself and I feel the insecurity you describe about being ugly or spotting the odd wrinkle or gray hair I will tell myself... 'It's fine that I'm not a pretty girl... I was designed to be utilitarian creature not a beautiful one...' trying to take pride in my intellect or technical skills When I put makeup on I feel like even slight makeup looks outrageously gaudy on me and it highlights everything I'm not by nature... it makes me paranoid about my appearance as it draws so much attention to my meh face to the point of feeling near dysphoria about it that I can nominally avoid.  Although yes I do feel envy when I see girls who have feminine attributes I desire and pine for myself... I choose to not devote alot of energy to trying to better my looks... Although that is probably a luxury I have that you don't because I don't have to look at myself more than one or twice a day. I'm sure if I had to analyse myself over and over I'd feel more anxious about my looks.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Like in a way taking pills and stuff to make my body look a certain way, and and like you were talking about, my style, are not just an expression of myself, but an artistic expression of myself. and I assume getting ffs (which i dont currently plan to but w/e) would be like an extension of that. It's not 'fake,' but in a way its a more honest expression of oneself than just coping with how you look naturally.

"Ok now that I've finished watching the video here are my thoughts.   Natalie, your physical beauty is pretty undeniable IMHO. But the gushing comments you receive aren't inherently about that. The amount of beauty you've sent out into the world and inspired in other people, to be better, more empathetic, gentler souls, far outshines any personal aesthetic one individual could achieve. You simply make our world a better place. The ability to change minds and hearts, the appeal to the better angels of our nature, is transformative in a way no amount of surgery could ever be.   Outer beauty matters for all the reasons you've listed. But beauty without substance is just propaganda.   Yours is nourishing. It gives us the courage to face the ugliness of the world and these times we live in.   We love you, though we do not truly know you. Because you help us love ourselves and others. We selfishly love you for your selfless gift of beauty.   And for the mouthfeel. xD","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a creature torn screaming NIN lyrics from the bosom of the 80's & 90's kink scene, body mod is style, so it's actually hard for me to back off from seeing 'cosmetic surgery' as art; thus expressive, thus style. I even feel that a bit about 'pure vanity' work; and every time I hear a person's story, it's always more than one might assume. It doesn't have to be deep to be style. It has to be intentional and expressive. But it can, and often does run deep in it's power for the person expressing it. And as style can be about carving your identity into the unwilling facade of a normative society, it all feels like it can be an aspect of revolution. This was an amazing rollercoaster of things to think about. Thank you for everything you do, I feel like it's desperately needed, even if it is pulling you away from your other true G.G.

"This is the first time I've seen any trans person with a platform (or really any trans person at all) be honest about the goal of transition. Yes, we want to pass, but we also want to be beautiful. Why ELSE would we have tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of work done on our bodies? Natalie's the first trans person I've come across that doesn't blow sunshine up your ass and try to act like everything they do transition-wise is Empowering(TM) OR do that thing that terminally unique Tumblrinas do where any and every attempt to look beautiful by the standards of society is selling out or counterrevolutionary.    I've caught flack in both online and meat space transmasculine circles for wanting FMS (facial masculinization surgery, the opposite of what Natalie had) because in moooooooooost transmasc circles, anything beyond top surgery is regarded as this extreme measure that means you must have something wrong with you at a deep psychological level beyond simple, well-known chest dysphoria. Sadly, the only person I can really be honest with is my cis female best friend. I can't really be 100% honest in any trans circle about the fact that at the end of all of this, I don't want to just 'pass,' I want to be beautiful. I want to be the man that all the other fags are jealous of when I walk into a room, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that, especially not after two decades of being derided for my looks, both before and after starting transition. If I'm going to have $200k-$300k worth of work done to my body, and go through ungodly amounts of pain, why wouldn't I want to come out of all of it beautiful?    Thanks for your honesty, Natalie, I can't even begin to tell you how fucking refreshing it is.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Whilst I think it's certainly true that the line between gender affirming and cosmetic procedures can be much less clear cut than the woke script would allow us to discuss it's interesting to me to compare to my own experiences and desires as a trans masculine person which are largely contradictory. In my personal experience my desire for medical transition is in no way a desire for beauty, and my desire for top surgery IS very much medical - not just for psychological reasons but physical one's too as binding is a daily discomfort and risk to my body.  In fact my major transition goal is to be able to express myself through the style I wish without it causing me to be misgendered","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Men 160% prefer women with just a bit of makeup (the natural 'look' not actual natural skin - which is flawed as shit.) I've spent years thinking about this shit. I have a journal entry on Fetlife about beauty standards and trying to embrace style as a concept.   It's literally painful to admit that looks/beauty/aesthetic matters to you when you're entire life people tell you that 'it's what's in your heart that matters', and 'personality always outweighs looks.' They're obviously lying! I've spent years making money off my perceived beauty. I've watched beautiful people out in the world get more attention, more jobs, more kindness, etc. It's a statistical fact. I've spent tens of thousands of dollars on treatments and products, all while simultaneously abhorring this culture of beauty and utterly feeling trapped by it.

Also, watching this made me realize some of my own internalized misoginy: I remember your video on Incels showing up repeatedly on my recommended page and me ignoring it because it was made by a woman with loads of makeup on and I thought that meant somehow it wouldn't be as deep/well-researched or whatever. I only gave you a shot when my brother mentioned you came from the Academia and I only properly respected you after finding out you're trans (white cis woman = stupid?).

"Personally I think my only hope is a transhumanist future happens where people have maximum control over themselves. I don't think my concerns are mainly aesthetic they are about impracticable amounts of power I can exert. For me, being the buff super tall masculine ideal is appealing but really its the power over others and over myself that is the most appealing. A 6 pack isn't going to get me laid, its a signal that I have my impulses under control and that control and that power attracts others to give ME, the choice of what happens in future social situations. So when brain implants and replacing muscles with cold steel happens I will be more than willing to get rid of my weak flesh bod.

"I relate so much to this. I had several cosmetic procedures years ago and I've barely talked about it with anyone.   When I was in my early twenties i saved up and took out a line of credit to get multiple surgeries in Mexico. I got derision from friends and family who knew, because I should 'know better' than to care so much. That I was 'fine' as I was (though, never good, never handsome, because I wasn't.)   I was secretly hoping that the surgery would change me as a person, that I would suddenly switch from being the quiet self-loathing anxiety-ridden boy that I was, into a confident people-person. I did change for the better, and I'm happy with my results (for the most part. i've had to spend time and money fixing a few fuckups/scars.) But most of the time I just feel unsure about myself, and I still have debt from the surgeries. I'm less miserable than I was, but still not happy. There's more I would change if I could.   And even when I do feel attractive, and other attractive people tell me so, there's a part of me that doesn't feel right, because my experience of growing up as a below average-looking person shaped me psychologically, and those deep psychological issues aren't touched by surgery. And if i'm on a date with an attractive person, in the back of my mind I do kind of resent them for their privilege, and the fact that they probably wouldn't have gone to the trouble of meeting me if I hadn't had so much work done.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I used to say the same to my female friends and girlfriends. That makeup and wanting to look pretty is selfish, sick and stupid. But with time I learned that is cool that they enjoy their person, that we all (females and males) have little time with the flour of our youth and good lookin. So we can all agree that is better to look at this habits not just as an ego thing, but rather to a way of love ourselves. At the end we're all heading to the darkness and before that we reach grayville where everyone is just old and ugly. So fuck it. Be beatiful, Natalie.

"I always had a pretty good image of myself for the most part, I was pretty much happy with how I looked at all times unless I was on my period. But then last year I realised I needed to lose weight as my BMI was overweight and I hadn't been paying attention to what I was eating. So I lost the weight pretty easily over 6 months. But after that I had to completely rekindle my body positivity because staring in the mirror looking for progress with my weight loss was making me analyse what needed to be changed about my body and what I didn't like just as much as I was noticing improvements.  I found what was best for me was to spend as much time in front of the mirror as possible, NOT analysing, just getting used to how I look. Not editing or thinking about editing. It can also help to take lots of pictures of yourself or film yourself a lot without trying to look good with makeup etc. And then I just started to really like how looked again, I guess I also worked on loving myself mentally too. But I started to get a happy boost when I looked in the mirror in the morning because I really liked how I looked.

"@ContraPoints Do what makes you feel good! But i would object to the claim that representation really makes you feel feminine. I think this is something you tell yourself to fight off the void, which is ofcourse a fine thing to do. But I think the true beauty of your person & personality shines within these videos and characters you share with the world. It is already externalized and that is fine. Sex & Gender is a hoax like everything in this universe, which was designed by some mad demon god. It does not need to be overcompensated by the beauty industry. You made me realize that i too had a woman in my head, sitting within a mans body, who is not really happy. Your Gender Dysphoria video transformed my understanding of myself. I looked back at art i made and things i have done in a new light (URL I still do not change my appearance at all, i'm quite a cis-man on the outside. Though in my written and drawn worlds as well as roleplay videogames i often am a woman as an avatar to explore my dreams. As silly as that sounds. Maybe i'm closeted. Probably i'm your opposite. Maybe i'm fake. I just do not think it is very healthy to look at beauty the way you expressed it in this video. You try to frontload your insecurity that again reminds me of myself. Just don't let that frontloading break you like it did break me. You are already immortal within these artful videos which in themselves have inspired countless others.

"The comparison of FFS surgery for trans women and double eyelid surgery for Asians is not only kinda transphobic as you said, but kinda racist too, because accusing Asian women of internal racism for wanting the surgery is basically implying that they want to look white, which is categorically untrue. These beauty ideals existed before many of the countries with prominent eyelid surgery culture even had seen white people at all. It's more about rarity of features than anything else - in pretty much any culture, features that are relatively rare among the genetic population (symmetrical and, well, not disfigurements at least) are what are considered the standard of beauty. Double eyelids are relatively uncommon among East Asians, and so they became a symbol of beauty due to this rarity.  This is also part of the reason why the colourism towards darker skinned people exists across Asia, while white people strive to be more tanned.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"_'Women in male-dominated fields sometimes feel like they have to present more masculine to be taken seriously.'_ Oh mood. If we ignore for a second the gigantic mess that is my gender identity, I've definitely felt the weird academia pressure to not be so very femme. I conformed to it too for a while. I didn't use makeup, wear my contacts, wear 'feminine' clothes, and even had short hair for a while. Until I realized that I was actually doing what women and nonbinary femme folk get accused of doing when we are 'too' feminine: I was dressing for other people. So I said fuck it and now stuffy old men in Anthropology departments can just learn to deal with the fact that I paint my lips with the blood of my enemies and my eyelids are sparkly. #Style  Oh and I definitely cracked up at the _'You guys are getting in the way of my crudely stereotyping people based on gender so...how dare you'_ comment.

"With lots of your other videos, I like them because they taught me something new about a topic that I wasn't previously knowledgeable, or opened my eyes to an issue I hadn't considered before. So what I love about this one is I went into it thinking I already knew all there was to know about beauty standards. I've been consuming feminist messages about the concept of beauty for lots of my life, and it often feels like an issue that people have already covered time and time again. Needless to say I didn't think I would find this video as enlightening or as informative as I did. I feel like I'll have to rewatch it a few more times to properly absorb everything, because there's just so much in here. Thank you, Natalie!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hm, I kinda disagree with Contra here. I went through this phase in high school, then I got married and grew up and now I only do basic grooming. No makeup or hair styling. I focus on my craft, my work, my passions in life. Beauty just stopped mattering at all when I did that. I don't think it's necessarily a female issue, I think it's just that women are obsessed with it because they believe it's where their value comes from. When you realize your value can come from your skills, your craft, your love, your personality, or other attributes, beauty stops mattering. I hope we can get to a society where that's what matters most (I realize that may be a utopian pipe dream)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This video attacked me personally tbh. aS a TrAnS mAn I've been thinking about where my desire to pass and my desire to be an 'attractive' man meet, and how to tell the difference between them. I've been pretty much exclusively read as a cis man for a few years now, and did have a year of total stealth. But I've always felt like a sort of 'failed' transition, because there's a very specific aesthetic of trans man who gets treated as attractive, and that's the skinny bodybuilder type. I'm... very average looking. Little chubby, reasonably cute face, solid 6/10. I do pretty much 100% pass, but I still feel like my appearance (and by extension, transition) is sub-par because I'm not a very easily consumable type of conventionally attractive.    I'd like to pretend that I'm definitely going to work through this and realise that tHe ReAl BeAuTy WaS mE aLl AlOnG, but like I'm definitely not. I literally watched this video while lifting weights and downing a protein shake, and the only reasons I haven't had FMS yet (which is a thing, btw. Rarer than FFS, but it is a thing) are money, and because trans men who are aware of it as a thing generally treat wanting it as something shameful + to be worked through, so it's hard to find info","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Dear contra, I am an ardent viewer of your videos so please don't take this negatively:  Desires are the most strongly constructed and reinforced of all social structures.   We cannot demand of people that they either live up to standards or give up on their desires. We cannot demand sacrifice.   And this is where the dilemma lies: what is the apt moment of this sacrifice because at *some* point, it'll have to be made for change to effectively take place?  And the answer is usually: when the revolution comes (like you said: America needs a contra, not a Gigi) Revolutions, wars, stories of struggles and so on have turned out to be these purification ceremonies whereby we think that something radically different will rise out of such a sacrifice. And this is not to say that revolutions, wars or struggles do not change people or their desires. They do. And, historically, they have. The problem is that in the 21st century we defer our responsibilities by repeatedly citing or believing within ourselves that such a change is far away in the future. It has been cancelled as a real possibility, and thus conformity and compliance with the current social structures is the only we keep bearings of who we are and where we belong. People are not confident of their own sovereignty and their radical autonomy because in the neoliberal craze of building the rational consumer/individual, what we instead have in front of us, is a broken and shattered individual who must purchase and acquire more and more products to fill the cracks and crevices (literally and/or metaphorically) in their person. For people who embody particular physical features that may take the form of white nationalism. For others it takes other forms (like gender conformity, gender change by embracing 'femininity' or 'masculinity', sub-nationalist movements and so on). We are all trying to fix the same problem in the same fucking way.  We have to destroy these categories, and I am sure you'd agree, but the irony of it all is that one can at best merely *express* anguish at this moment. We simply do not know what to *do*!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"AS a TrAnS mAn working in academia I honestly can relate. I don't know if it is one of the many remnants of people believing me to be a girl growing up, but I am obsessed with beauty as well. My colleagues of any gender rarely give a fuck about styling or make up while I arrive in full on 'boy george as your sleep paralysis' realness. It strengthens my gender dysphoria but also contradicts it in strange ways as I have an overly specific male ideal in my head and I life in unreasonable fear of not meeting those standards. If you're a leftist academic or intellectual, you are basically expected to shed the contraints of societal pressure and stop striving for beauty. And if you are a trans man people tend to view any of your attempts at self-expression with an unforgivingly critical eye. So I end up in a hate spiral where I beat myself up for wanting to be beautiful as much as I am beating myself up over not being that.   What I am trying to say is, that I feel incredibly seen by this video. Let's forgive ourselves and convert beauty into style. Thank you.

"While I can't speak for others, I think your attractivness is in large part due to your aesthetic. The clothes, the makeup and the mannerisms are all part of what I find attractive (along with your incredible analysis). As for passing or not that has a lot to do with people's idealization of 'woman' seeing how you always looked more femenine than I ever did even with makeup on (and I'm a cis woman). But also many women I know tend to be called masculine because of their face structure despite being born female. It didn't actually occur to me that you were trans until I watched some of your older videos. Lastly tje desire to look pretty has everything to do with feeling comfortable and strong, whenever I wear my leather jacket or a scarf I feel stronger and that reflects on my posture. If being femenine (as per society's standarts) makes you feel better then that's great. So many people don't even know what makes them feel good and that takes power away from them.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There is an old self-help book, 'Psycho-Cybernetics' by Maxwell Maltz. One of the things he observes is that people have different reactions to scaring and surgery. There was a time when young Prussian men liked getting a 'dueling scar' to boast of their masculine bravery! Most (sane) people would be devastated to get such a horrible scar on their cheek! He was a plastic surgeon before he was a self-help guru. He claimed that no matter how much surgery some people get, they still think they are ugly, or have a big nose (or whatever.) Maltz decided the people had psychological flaws and refused to accept their new reality. That's why he developed Psycho-Cybernetics! He also claims it takes about 30 days to adjust to a new change. So you may still be adjusting to your changes. These days there are Kindle and audio versions of the book! (If you're interested.) I still have my copy from the 1960's. I am pretty sure the original book dates to the 1950's or even 1940's. But, Honey, IT'S TIMELESS! URL","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think the key point of this video (that critique of beauty standards doesn't lead to an answer to the desire for beauty) stems from a poor critique of beauty standards. The problem with modern beauty standards is that there are BETTER things to notice in people, not that it is wrong to appreciate good looks. Yes, Megan Markle is beautiful, but that doesn't matter if you meet her and don't like her personality: if you were to find her self-involved or boring. Character matters much more than looks, and if one bases their interactions on that, one will be happier. It isn't that beauty standards stem from hate or fear (though they do), it is that they miss a much more important domain of human relationships which is much more gratifying. Vanity of personality only leads to good actions; vanity of the body only leads to self-hatred.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"One thing I do for the whole 'to change a construct, change society' idea is to change the way I view the construct first, and then act on change. Usually changing the way I perceive a construct to something neutral feeling is a good way to start to think about where the boundary is social change is.  For example, interpreting makeup as face paint can very quickly change the way you think about it. And I'm not meaning vaguely acknowledging that makeup is technically face paint on an intellectual level, I mean changing the way you automatically think about makeup on a near visceral level. And this isn't to make fun of makeup, it's just to see it differently. There's nothing morally wrong with wanting to paint your face, but a society that has created a sustained desire in some people to regularly paint their face starts to get questionable.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Something that is not asked often enough.  WHY is beauty, even so called feminine beauty ONLY for women, or gay men?  Perhaps this is the issue, or one of them.   Much of what is stated here signs a lot like social dysphoria.  I know I myself deal with that.  I LIKE looking 'feminine' but only to an extent.  I like blurring the lines.    Gender expectations, rules, limits are the problem.  Frankly and honestly though...you have ALWAYS....yes always had a pleasant look to you.  I wish society would just go eff itself, and drop all these damned gendered norms.  They do far more harm than good.    My BIG question is WHY?

"Finished video. Thank you for sharing! I have always been obsessed with being ' beautiful' and lately have been asking dear me ' If you just ...you know...let your body be what it was and be kind to it...what would you be so afraid to lose?  Well...I might stop doing all these actions that will eventually lead to me being kind to my body! I can't risk that! So i must continue to hate myself!'.  I hate myself so I can eventually like myself and if i allow myself to like myself I am afraid I will stop desiring actions that lead to me liking myself haha The whole cycle is madness. I think when we acknowledge we can do both: the reality of our preferences, creativity, expression, desires and knowing we don't have to DROP those things can lead to us feeling safe enough to actually give our bodies a break.  Maybe the answer isn't in pretending all of that doesn't matter to us ? I love that you highlight this. we don't have to sacrifice those desires before we can like the person in the mirror.  It can be both. To an expression  person, it kind of has to be both. Love love.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I just need to focus on taking care of myself before trying to look good but it doesn't stop the desire. Maybe this is why I rarely leave the house. This turned into longer comment than I thought. I feel if I tried it would be a pursuit in futility and I may become obsessed/preoccupied, idk. Guess I'd rather not try and try not to think about it than try and fail over and over until I die and it was for nothing. Wow I feel depressed now great video though.   Maybe we should de-stigmatize being ugly or just not beautiful. I don't think I'm hideous but often feel that way. Idk. I'm rambling.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"i'm a trans guy and usually on days i feel really dysphoric i feel ugly. especially when i was a child and pre-t and pre surgery, to me looking fem was gross and i always hated how i looked. now that i'm almost 4 years on T i wont lie i stare at myself in the mirror sometimes and say to myself 'shit you're hot as fuck'. I feel like it has a lot to do with how we see ourselves in our head, when i was young i always wanted a strong jawline, facial hair and masculine features. now that i have that i feel comfortable about my physical appearence. maybe i'm just full of myself but i don't know, feeling 'attractive' has always been tied in to my gender as a trans person.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Even if attained, at least in the eyes of others, it's presence is fleeting, and you will resent it's absensce. The search for beauty fills us with fear, anxiety and inadequateness.  Beauty is suffering. It cannot be anything else.  The best thing we can do is to let go of our desires, and break free from our cravings.  Loving, peaceful kindness is possible. But it takes work.

Working to undermine my own ego of boasting when successful, or taking pleasure in my looks, has helped me be a happier person on balance, I think. There really is something to internalising and working towards a point of view less concerned with the physical, whether that is recognising that everyone has some feature you admire or consciously acting against, or at least recognising, your own biases around looks.

"The part at ten minutes makes it sound like the only reasons cis women have to not care much about cosmetics is if they're pressured by men, or if they're trying too hard to be 'not like other girls'.  Some men don't care about sports. Some women don't care about makeup.  For me, I'd like to look beautiful, I do care about how I look, and I get very self conscious sometimes. I have very feminine tastes. If I could wear princess dresses to work, I would. But I just don't really care much about makeup. It's super cool and I admire people who are good at it, but I generally can't be bothered to wear it. I don't feel that way because I'm pressured to (in fact I feel pressure to wear makeup) and I embrace being girly in my own way.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I'd love to be able to go to the beach or the pool without either wearing a swim binder or having my moobs flap around inside a wet rashguard for all to see, or, worse, nakedly visible for strangers to avert their children's eyes from. but that's like 90% a social reason. if other people were cool with me having a chest like this and not wearing a shirt over it, I honestly wouldn't mind having it. but they *aren't* cool with it, that's not what reality is like. the truth is, I get more psychological distress worrying about what other people will do when they see my body than my own brain could ever conjure when I look at it alone in the shower.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
