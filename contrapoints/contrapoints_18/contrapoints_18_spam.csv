1206,"I treat my depression like a cold; sometimes the best thing is to ride it out, light exercise, sleep it off, eat something, drink tea/something with a lot of fruit in it... taking drugs might ease the symptoms but not cure it, for some this is the best solution, but for most it isn't and the long term effects are too damaging for it to be worthwhile. Basically, mental health needs to be treated individually, not just a blanket solution to suit everyone. If that makes sense?",en,relativeinsight,2019-08-01T00:00:00,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
