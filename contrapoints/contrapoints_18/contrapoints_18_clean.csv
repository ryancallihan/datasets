"The problem here is that people in your past seem to have diagnosed fairly normal behaviors as abnormal ones.   A behavior becomes a disorder/disease when it starts getting in the way of healthy functioning. If it gets in the way of someone being able to go to school, function socially, hold down a job, be independent, make conscious and healthy life choices etc.  It's the measure of how much it hinders you that is the issue, not how difficult it is for someone else to wrangle you as a child.   I wouldn't recommend people with schizo-affective disorder to quit their Seroquel on their own.. any more than the average kid should be on amphetamines..   I'm sorry they got it so wrong in your case.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"To me it's simple. Is this emotion fucking up your life, relationships, self esteem, and is holding you back from things you want to do? In my case, bipolar disorder was. I attempted suicide twice and was hospitalized. What I saw at the hospital were not teenagers with emotions (I was a teenager too). I saw shattered lives. And inpatient did help me and many others I know, along with meds. As an adult, I still take meds (will probably take them forever) and I feel genuinely well and healthy.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"So relatable, none of the shrinks ever agreed as to whether what I have is borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder or good ol' depression. I've even had one quack tell me recently I have an untended narcissistic wound (which sure sounds like sound medical diagnosis based on available scientific evidence lol). You can imagine that the shrinks don't like it when I say that there is nothing wrong with me and that the way I am is merely a response to environmental factors (e.g. money etc). After years of putting up with the valium, seroquel, trazodone, elavil, ativan, efexor, ambien and selexa, I can safely say that you get objectively better psychiatric results from not going to the shrink and self medicating via your local liquor store and friendly neighborhood dealer. It's cheaper, comes with less side effects and means much less time in sterile waiting rooms. I don't mean to say psychiatry in general is a fraud, some people with actual conditions like hallucinations induced by schizophrenia actually need the shrinks and the drugs, but nowadays they have a habit of making each and every single negative emotion into a disorder or condition of its own.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I had a lot of difficulty going to work, getting things done, or leaving the house for a while and went to a few people for it. At one point I was diagnosed with 'Emotional ADD,' something no other therapist or psychologist has been able to define for me since then, and was prescribed adderall. I was stoked since I was pretty much trying to get that prescription because I had tried it illicitly once before and found it very... effective. It was very easy to sway the guy that direction just by looking up the specific reasons Adderall is prescribed and repeating them during our sessions. Anyway, it certainly worked at getting me productive, but I was also getting upset all of the time, my temper was so short which was weird because (not to toot my own horn) I am one of the most patient, soft spoken people I know. The new short temper I could only wield as an unruly club eventually was one of the key causes that my relationship of 5 years began to dissolve.  Of course, it turns out it was probably the relationship that got me so depressed! After the break up, I stopped taking adderall, started being able to live for myself outside of a soulless relationship, and found the freedom to explore parts of my life I had been repressing since getting into that 'lifelong' relationship at the too-young age of 20. The psychiatrist that prescribed me adderall? I'm pretty sure he was a quack. His office was in a big abandoned strip mall and it was always so scary to go to.  I've  always thought people are too quick to jump to medication instead of addressing the roots of problems. My parents sent me to therapists in elementary school to see if I had ADHD because I was smart and didn't do homework and had a hard time in class etc etc.... but it was because I was being made fun of all the time for smelling like my parent's cigarette smoke or having a cleft pallet. It had nothing to do with medication. The adults in my life just didn't want to take the time or invest the energy into getting to know me, but my parents had plenty of money to throw at medication. The guy I was dating in that long relationship was the same way, he wasn't interested in investing the time and energy into the relationship when I suggested it might be in trouble. Instead of working with me to heal things, he almost immediately decided I needed to see a therapist. He wouldn't even consider a couple's therapist, all of the fault had to be mine. I guess in the long run it got us to where we needed to be, but it was a heartbreaking realization to know you'd move mountains for a man who just can't be bothered.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"My sister and I are both victims are rough childhoods and grew up with poor coping skills.  I've been on about 8 different medications to manage depression and anxiety from trauma and poverty.  Now, I've been off all medication for about 3 years and I've never felt this clear-minded and stable.  My sister, unfortunately, has been on meds since age 12 and will likely be on them for the rest of her life.  I personally know so many people that have had their lives ruined by this system that, as you said, 'medicalizes' normal emotions.  So many people can't get out of the medication cycle, and many are convinced that meds are the only thing that can help.  Some medications are legitimate but many are the result of addiction and brain-washing. Studies show that therapy is just as effective, if not more effective than medications in many cases.  I probably sound like a conspiracy theorist but I've seen the horror of this first-hand.

But if you are somewhat depressed, your brain makes you feel like you're ok with that being the state of things for the rest of your life, even though it DOESN'T HAVE TO BE. I think both Contrapoints and other channels like Philosophytube frequently fall into the trap of their own lingering symptoms. Think of the 'this is fine' meme... from the outside, as someone who went through long periods like that, that's clearly what's going on.

"My childhood story is similar to yours. One of my psychiatrists, the most damaging one, wrote books in his native country about 'medicating the mental patient' of which i, at 8 yoa, was definitely progeny of his beliefs. My state got involved with my case bc of the odd drugs he had me on, and shortly after that he committed suicide. I quit with the psychiatrists and pharmaceuticals by 22 yoa, for similar reasons as yours. Im 40 yoa this year, born a woman and identify as a cis woman, but most definitely butch, not feminine much at all.. and it took me a long effin time to realize there is nothing wrong with me. Nothing at all. Im a taurus sun, cancer moon and virgo rising born on the 1st. I react passionately to things because i FEEL passionately. I cannot be controlled, or molded into anyone elses ideas of who i should be, and  im sure thats what they were trying to 'treat' all along. But theres nothing wrong with it, nothing to treat. Being free to be myself without a thumb always on me is my cure. That cure has not come around fully, yet..every day is still full of struggles for it..but every day it gets easier to respond appropriately.

"I'm a third year psych student. Also a human. From what I see, over medication is definitely an issue in North America for pain and psychological disorders. I question psychiatry to an extent as I'm personally a fan of working on changing thoughts and behaviors and listening over the use of pharmaceuticals. I don't deny that further help may be required for those who continue to suffer despite all other efforts made, but strongly believe that all other options should be soght out first. For example depression or anxiety could be due to poor treatment of a person, if they leave the environment and improve then did they need a drug it a change in their life? Or OCD working on reducing certain habits so the mental chatter is then reduced. Some high functioning auditory/visually hallucinating schizophrenics can go off of medication and watch others to see if the things they see are real or not. But of course these options don't work for some moderate and probably most severe cases. I like psychology it counseling over psychiatry.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I was diagnosed at age 66 for ADHD Inattentive Type, which I truly have.  But in my experience, the pendulum has swung and they no longer give out psych meds like candy.  It took months of interviews to get the prescription.  Partly it seems due to my age, as they are more concerned about cardiac issues with older people.  And it might be mainly for speed.

"This is a tricky thing. I like to think that I'm as anti-capitalist as they come (and, oh, irony, I'm typing this on my MacBook Pro), but I cringe whenever I hear 'for-profit' used as an argument against a thing. I'm a teacher, and I get paid for the work that I do, and I wouldn't do it if I didn't get paid; does that mean that I'm *only* in it for the money? Likewise, I have friends who work as researchers in the pharmaceutical industry, and I wouldn't be surprised if they also expected to get paid for their work. But they also do it for other reasons: they love science and chemistry and they want their knowledge and research to help people. The danger of capitalism, and where it threatens our very survival, comes from the top: not from the researchers and lab technicians, but from the CEOs and PR departments (about 50% of the cost of a drug goes into marketing, not further research), who push products on overworked doctors, or push lobbyists on ambitious lawmakers. But yeah, brain chemistry is extremely complicated, and psychiatric care is driven almost entirely by self-reporting of the patient, so it necessarily requires the doctor and the patient to work together toward a treatment. Add to that that most psychiatric drugs are specifically designed to work slowly, to avoid dependency, so it can take time, sometimes months, for the drug to take effect. In the meantime, the body needs to adjust to the new chemicals being introduced, which necessarily results in side-effects. It took me months to get to the dose I'm currently at, and I'm not all better yet, but I DO know that if I hadn't gone and talked to my doctor, I would be dead now. And with all the shit that's been going on in my life these past few months, I'm definitely glad I'm on medication.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

As a result of this, depending on where a person is in their experience of this, there is a risk that they can get the motivation to act on this feeling before the feeling lifts. It's important that clinicians and patients work together to decide what the best course of action is and when and how to implement it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm really glad you are doing well, and are free from what sounds like a traumatic series of misdiagnoses. I also find psychiatric diagnosis frighteningly subjective. However sometimes people very definitely have a problem that is diagnosable and requires intervention. I have bipolar disorder, and most of the time it shows itself as depression and anxiety, which varies in intensity and for me can be so debilitating that it takes hours to dress myself in very unimpressive clothing.   The reason I know with absolute certainty that bipolar disorder is a thing, and that I have it is my experience of mania and hypomania. That shit is bizarre and frightening. Even when I was euphoric, I was frightened because I couldn't concentrate at all, and I knew that was wrong. Sometimes I couldn't speak in sentences, or understand when other people spoke. At one point it was something close to word salad. All without drugs.

"While I completely agree that people are overdiagnosed and overmedicated, the primary message seems dangerous. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the point. To me, it seems like you're saying that psychiatry for the most part is ineffective treatment. Bipolar and psychotic disorders absolutely require medication. Other disorders occur on a spectrum, and the treatment varies. Psychiatry isn't perfect, and I strongly believe that a psychologist, in most situations, should be the primary treatment. It does have its place, though.  Edit: you asked about experiences, so..I was like you in high school, overmedicated, they didn't know what was wrong (mostly because I didn't communicate what was tormenting me..an eating disorder, an abusive relationship, trauma, and tormenting intrusive thoughts). It easily led to depression, anxiety, and rage. Adulthood, substance abuse was my way of self medicating. I also had some mania with psychosis. I had severe OCD. Like shit you see on documentaries. Very suicidal. Panic attacks. I was raped and sexually abused a handful of times, so I developed ptsd. Throughout my journey, I have off and on had therapy and medication. Now..I'm ok. I get suicidal sometimes. I have anxiety and some obsessive compulsiveness. I think if I didn't have treatment I wouldn't be alive. My journey has been rocky and imperfect. Professionals are limited in their abilities, considering how little we truly know about the mind. I think they do their best, and I do my own research on treatments, too, and assist them in giving me the best treatment. I'm not happy, though.

In my case, I have a personal trust issue with psychiatrists because when I first sought treatment 15 years ago I told them I needed to talk about my horrible home life. They wouldn't.

"*Part 1: Depression* I struggled with depression for most of my life, starting from about when I was in middle school, around 1997 when I was about 12 years old.  In my case, it _was_ a serious disease that produced some very maladaptive thoughts and kept me from being able to feel contented for a long time.  This was exacerbated by the difficulty I had interacting with other people, which I later found out was undiagnosed Asperger's syndrome.  More on that below.  *What didn't work* Regarding medication, I had already tried therapy for my depression, but no one with whom I spoke really seemed to do any good.  They just took my time away from work and charged me hundreds of dollars, and I was making zero progress.  When I went to a general practitioner and got prescribed anti-depressants, I thought I was on a better track, but it was equally useless for me, if not possibly worse.  The first reaction I remember having to the anti-depressant Wellbutrin was anger.  Just blind, unthinking, vague anger at nothing at all.  My doctor was not a particularly helpful one, either.  She would _not_ let me off those drugs.  If I told her that they were not helping, she would say that was proof that I still needed to be on them so that they could work.  If I told her that they _were_ helping and that I was feeling _better_ now, she said that was evidence that they were helping, so I needed to keep taking them.  I was literally trying to find what I could possibly say to her that would get her to let me off of them.  Apparently, the magic phrase was: 'I lost my job and with it my health insurance, so I cannot afford these drugs anymore.  Tell me how to step down off them safely.'  I experienced no noticeable withdrawal, which reinforced my suspicion that the drugs had done me no good in the first place.  *What DID work* YouTube.  Would you believe it?  Tens of thousands of dollars wasted on doctors and drugs, and what gave me the right angle to fix myself was a pair of YouTube videos: 'The Tetris Effect- Train Your Brain!' followed by 'Why Happiness is the New Productivity (The Story of Mindvalley) | Vishen Lakhiani'.  Part of what locked me into my vicious cycle of depression was a pair of beliefs.  The first was that I could do nothing to affect my own mind, to change the thoughts that I had.  The 'Tetris Effect' video showed me that I could change my mind.  The other harmful belief was that I needed to beat myself up for every imperfection in order to motivate myself to be better.  The 'Happiness is ... Productivity' video showed me that the opposite was true.  I decided to give it a shot, and spend a few minutes every day finding something genuinely positive to say about myself, to look to the future, to find something about which to be grateful.  It was awkward and clunky at first, like learning to play a musical instrument.  It felt a bit insincere, but I trained my brain.  With practice, I got better.  Nowadays, I think of myself as having 'depression in remission'.  It's sort of like having herpes.  It doesn't flare up often, but I will always have it.  But that is okay.  I have the tools to deal with it, and even at its worst, I know that I will recover.  My default is no longer self-loathing.  My default is positive, and that makes all the difference.  *Part 2: Asperger's Syndrome* As I said before, I had a very hard time relating to people.  Many people with Asperger's syndrome have ways of handling it much better than I did, but in my case, the lack of empathy and ability to relate to other humans led me to some pretty scummy ideas, speech, and behavior.  I was _not_ a good guy in high school, I am ashamed to admit.  I did not realize it at the time, though.  I was a total 'Nice Guy(tm)' incel asshole, though those particular terms were not familiar to me at the time.  I was very stunted in my development of social skills.  I think part of that was because no one taught me social skills.  I was expected to pick them up naturally the way that neurotypical people did, but I was not well-adapted to learn that way.  On the contrary, I was repeatedly exposed to messages like 'Break the mold', 'Don't be a conformist', 'Be yourself', et cetera.  These messages are great for people who feel undue pressure to conform, but in my personal case, I actually needed to hear the opposite message, because I was interpreting these messages as 'Ignore other people', 'Their feelings are irrelevant', 'The only truth comes from within your own mind', et cetera.  This was not diagnosed in me until much later in my life, so for a long time, I had no idea that there was even anything wrong with me (aside from the depression).  On the contrary, I sort of thought that there was something wrong with _EVERYONE ELSE,_ and I hated it.  Eventually, though, I realized that, if I were going to succeed in 'real life' (life after academia), I needed to learn how to get along with people.  *What DID work* I tried going to public places and sitting and watching and listening to people as much as I could to try to mimic humans, as though to see if I could trick them into thinking that I was a fellow human just like them.  It was a fair start.  Later, I attended a set of 'Authentic Relating' games/experience in weekend classes.  This came with exercises in interacting with people, including an 'empathy' game, that I found extremely helpful.  Eventually, I listened to the audio book version of 'How to Win Friends and Influence People'.  I listened to it twice.  It was an incredibly helpful body of work for teaching me how to be a social being, and I strongly recommend it.  *Conclusion* So, basically, thank you for sharing your journey.  I wanted to share my own, too, so that anyone struggling with similar feelings and issues who has not tried those things that worked for me might try them and see if they work for them.  Also, to other viewers, let me know what you think about this, or how this relates to your own journey.  Best wishes!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"So, this video kind of inspired me to try psychiatric drugs for my depression/anxiety (I know that wasn't really your point, but...). They made me so constipated and bloated for a month I had to get off of them (I took Lexapro for one week and mirtazapine for 3 weeks). I know the drugs work really well for some people, but I'd advise anyone thinking of trying them to pay attention to what they do to your stomach... they have anti-cholinergic effects, which means they disrupt the brain chemical that helps your bowels move. Now I'm thinking my issue might not be something related to serotonin, but maybe dopamine or the acetyl-choline system? There are some places (naturopaths) you can actually get neurotransmitter tests done and they will tell you what chemicals your brain is having problems producing.  On the other hand, I think life does have a strong effect on your mind... if you're not in a good place in your life, you're not going to be happy even if your brain chemicals are functioning properly.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Another thing to consider is that for many mental illnesses, its a process to find the right medication. Everyone is a little different so a medicine that may make one person feel happy may make another even more depressed. You should also be sure to see a therepist. Any doctor worth their paycheck will tell you giving you a pill will help a little, but to really get the most from it you should see a good therapist. And finding one who you get along with can also be a process, but once you do things can get a lot better if you're someone who seriously needs help.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I personally think it all has just one root: The anxiety.   My anxiety really blocked my life. There were tons of things I just couldn't do because of anxiety. And most of them were quite simple. I knew this was uncommon once I started to see others. The grand revelation was when I talked with a biologist who had a different approach towards anxiety and we talked about it for some time.  What has helped me though, besides the single pill I have to take, has been to change my life in a positive way. I think of my anxiety as a bad stomachache. You can prevent stomachaches by eating healthy and mantaining good health. Same goes for anxiety: There are activities that can help me a lot. Excercise has been fundamental for me. And a lot of spiritual texts too (although I'm a non-believer, being an intellectually curious person has driven me to read more mind-related topics in a variety of perspectives).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Videos like these put me on edge because they arouse paranoia I deal with everyday. I have taken adderall since age 8. Since then it's always a question of is this right? Am I the problem or is it the environment. If it is the environment, is it right to argue against it? I feel like a pretender on adderall, but it does help. I mean, it helps with focus. Not what to focus on. So in a sense it gives you autonomy. But then there's other aspects. Like am I supposed to be doing what I'm doing if I really can't mentally keep up with it? Just because it's a state requirement? Is adderall just like Huxleys soma? Does it teach me that I should expect to feel good all the time? And if I don't then it's bad? But there's different levels of bad. And is it just selfish to think this much about myself? I haven't considered other people. But our social system tells us to not be selfish but also paradoxically to focus on ourselves. And being selfish does feel good, whereas caring for others feels morally good.  One more thing. And I don't mean this as an attack and I don't know OP personally. But lots of her videos feature excessive drinking played for humor but a lot of her videos also feature what we are expected to understand are genuine feelings of OP. So it's not a stretch then to suppose that perhaps OP might have at least an alcohol dependency. And alcohol is a drug which then if true contradicts OPs claim that she doesn't take psychiatric drugs anymore. Again, not an attack, alcohol dependence is serious, just observations.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"One thing that I think is a problem with America's approach to psychiatry is that really doesn't allow for anything other than happiness.  'You're not happy? Take these pills.'  'Feeling fidgety? Take these pills.' It's not 'okay' to not be okay. I don't doubt that there are some disorders which require medication because of how debilitating they are, however I believe American psychiatry is a bit trigger happy.  I say that the first try shouldn't be to psychiatry, but psychology. Talk therapy can help everyone, even if it's just to have someone to vent to about work or school. It helps with depression, anxiety, and much more. If it's not enough then I would seek the counsel of a psychiatrist, but I say that you should always see a therapist first.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I know this video is like 3 years old now but fuck it: I tell this story at literally every opportunity because it's necessary. I'm 22, and last year I got diagnosed with ADHD and put on what we call Dexxies in Australia (Adderall in the US). I got diagnosed after taking a pill full of speed at a music festival and it made me sit down and concentrate for hours instead of dance. I had been tested for ADHD in preschool - the school's decision, not my parents - and the psychiatrist said I needed to be in a more structured environment so my parents moved me from Montessori to public school and that was that. But, from the time I was 16 to the time I was 21, my life began to fall apart - I couldn't concentrate while driving so would have minor accident after minor accident, which ended up with my parents spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars at the panelbeater. My social life was slipping, I could't hold down a job. My life has changed so much since starting meds - I went from failing uni to getting HDs, I have a job, I have stable relationships and feel pretty much fine all the time. So like, obviously this is a good thing, right? Well, Contra mentioned the rage and despair she got from the meds, and honestly I feel the same way. At the end of each day I'm worn out, I have the shits with everyone and I basically go hide in my room to die for a few hours. There's stuff that helps this obviously - eating healthy, various vitamin supps, exercise (which is realistically the biggest help for ADHD but again something made very difficult by capitalism and colonialism), having a supportive network of neurodivergent queers and weirdos who 'get it'. I also have done a lot of learning about ADHD and have come to the conclusion that: if I didn't live in a colonialist-capitalist world, my ADHD would never have been a problem for me really. They say ADHD is the brain of a hunter, and honestly if I could run around in the forest all day picking mushrooms and fruits I think that pretty much every single one of my problems would be solved - I wouldn't have to make myself fit around an education system that wasn't made with me in mind, I wouldn't have to bend myself into a job market that doesn't want me to succeed in it, I wouldn't have to wear the burden of ableism that destroys my self-confidence and turns everything into an unwinnable competition. But I can't do that just yet, so I've settled for dexxies, endless cups of coffee and chugging down berocca and about 15 litres of water every day to mitigate the side effects. Realistically I just can't live without it, but it's also a lot better than being so angry and frustrated at my inability to do pretty much anything right in the world and fucking up everything I do because I can't remember what happened 5 minutes ago. And let's be clear: I still feel like that most or all of the time, but at least the medication gives me the resilience to be able to continue to keep trying every day.  I also have an OCD diagnosis but I only got it after like 10 years of having massive meltdowns if I thought there were germs on me and picking at my own skin. For that I was given a drug called fluvoxamine which worked but also worsened my executive function to the point where I basically spent all day happily lying in bed until someone would make the very reasonable suggestion that I get out of bed, and I just got the shits again.  I get so anxious every time I see a video like this, or someone starts up the 'let's criticise psychiatry' thing because I think so often it just doesn't center around the people who are going to those people for help and why, it ends so often with like the 'sheeple who take too many pills' getting the blame. I don't think that was done in this video, maybe because it came from someone who's been on the Magic Roundabout of the therapist's office before, but I think that this is something that ends up inhibiting every discussion on the topic, and probably also because when you have ADHD, you can't leave the house without some fuckwit coming up to you and going 'hey did you know ADHD isn't real it's just society don't take your meds just do more exercise, something somethign CBD oil just work harder and concentrate more you can do it.' It's infuriating.  Bottom line in response to this video - maybe I'm not really sick objectively speaking, but I'm sick subject to the pressures of colonialism and capitalism, and psychiatry is more or less the only avenue of tangible help and survival I have in this situation and I'm going to use that option until such a point where I no longer need to.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I think what sometimes is overlooked when seeking mental help is that finding the appropriate professional is key. Just because someone has all the credentials and experience necessary doesn't mean they're the right doctor for you. I tried going on medication for my depression and while it made the horrible sense of dread and numbness more bearable, it also made me withdrawn and leveled out my emotions. What so far has worked for me is finding a therapist that specializes in DBT and going off the meds. The therapy has helped me build resiliency to the depressive and anxious episodes without the medications (which posed other health complications) and I am better able to manage my mental health. Good luck to everyone else out there dealing with mental illness or otherwise going through a shitty time. You are worth putting the time and effort into yourself to get better.

"I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 7, which is early for a girl. I do understand that it's a spectrum and that maybe a good portion of the symptoms are brought on by the rigid nature of our society (the same could be said of depression and anxiety according to Johann Hari). But I will say that adderall has been excellent for me and enables me to function well as an adult (I was prescribed on and off as a child, because my parents too had adhd and would forget to get me a prescription.) I don't feel an emotional comedown, I just get really hungry when it wears off.

In my last therapy session I remember telling to my pshycologist that I was feeling very nervious, adding to panic atacks, and I would never recieve and answer of what a concret thing should I do to deal with that, with actions in my daily life.... just talking about myself, conecting facts with my ancestors.......

"A good therapist or psychiatrist is interested in one of two things. Primarily what the client thinks is problematic in their life and how well they see the problem brought by their response pattern. Many therapist and psychiatrist who work with children and adolescents did not specialize in that population. They aren't great (in my experience) at understand developmental difference in cognition, emotional expression and abstraction.   Very often when working with teenagers in particular, you have a person with noticeably problematic behavior pattern which is largely ignored because trying to directly resolve the problem is too scary or the reward is to abstract to understand. An example would be a 16 year old who smokes weed because he thinks he is having fun, but clearly is trying to avoid the emotional neglect at home. Or a 14 year old who is cruel and mean to any person who attempts an intimate relationship for fear of abandonment. These cases prompt and ugly questions: Is it better to respect the client and allow them to spiral out of control until they are ready to seek help (damage being done) or to force and intervention that robs autonomy but could help? Its never easy to tell, I have times when I muscled my way into a kids inner problems and he tearfully thanked me and times where I felt I was just pushing the kid too hard and making him hate me.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've been diagnosed with a few of these same things. Sometimes I legitimately needed help, other times no so much.  Lexapro was useless but I think Zoloft may have helped me? Not sure...  Seroquel, Zyprexa, and all other anti-psychotics are the fucking devil and you should NEVER take them unless you are so detached from reality that you are actively hurting yourself and other people. Otherwise, the side-effects are just not worth it. Not to mention, the withdrawals were as bad as anything I've ever experienced (which is a lot) and lasted much longer than coming off any other drug. Imagine all the scary shit you've ever heard or seen about drug withdrawals and seroquel will give it to you while you stay awake for a week straight or more (literally completely awake to the point where it's really fucking creepy). And if you never actually had any auditory or visual distortions/hallucinations before you went on anti-psychotics, you will after! At least when you quit heroin you can reasonably expect to feel somewhat better by the end of a typical work week, but with seroquel you will still be shivering uncontrollably, unable to sleep, with seriously evil shit going on in your peripheral vision with no end in sight. All for a drug that doesn't even get you high.  Klonopin is pretty cool until you have to take about 8mg at a time to feel anything. Honestly, I didn't think coming off that stuff was as bad as a lot of the horror stories I read about benzo withdrawal. Still was not pleasant to stop, but to this day benzos and opiates are the only drugs that ever alleviated my constant boiling feeling of anxiety let alone the panic attacks that felt like heart attacks bad enough to literally bring me to my knees and sometimes lose consciousness amid feelings of pure irrational terror and severe physical pain at least a few times a week. I guess I should meditate about that or something?  Adderall was never prescribed to me but I did a bunch anyway. No complaints, but it's just not on the same level as meth.  Alcohol is honestly pretty lame as far as drugs go. Obviously this doesn't stop me from drinking but I don't really enjoy it. I used to be a very heavy drinker just because alcohol is so easily available when you hate having feelings but these days I hardly ever drink and never unless somebody invites me to.  The longest I've ever spent in a psychiatric institution in one stretch was a little over a week and honestly I fucking loved it. Not even kidding, it was a great experience. Everyone I met in there was really cool and I was totally fine with the adult day care vibe of the whole thing. All the rules and regulations didn't really bother me either, in fact it was pretty fun to violate them just to see what would happen. I was never bad enough to require a dose of ass juice (This is when the dudes in scrubs wrestle you to the ground and stick a syringe filled with thorazine and lorazepam in the easiest target, usually your ass, hence the name) but I did spend some time in the quite room, which just like it sounds is basically a more luxurious version of solitary confinement. My one real complaint is that they never let us watch One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest because it would have been too upsetting for some people. They never considered that other people might find nonstop gameshows and football upsetting but whatever. When I found out they had a smart tv with netflix I almost led an insurrection to demand my special request be met but that didn't work. It was fun though, and leaving that place was pretty sad because I had no friends outside and you just don't really speak to people you meet in psych wards in the outside world (unwritten rule I guess).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Actually I thibk that DSM driven psychiatry really leads to transforming any human condition in a mental disease, which does not actually mean that mental illness does not exist. As we can't really use an objective instrument to mesure subjectivity we are only equipped with our subjectivity as doctors. Which actually means that we have to always see psychiatric diagnoses as an hypothesis and not as a matter of fact.

"I want to share my experience of psychiatry. First of all, I'm from Switzerland and there, every medicals appointments is refund. I started getting bad when I was around 15. I had a massive depression who slowly became a chronic, irrational anxiety. I was afraid of pretty much everything, like going out etc. I was persuaded to be physically sick all the time. I spend hours to diagnosed myself every deseases possibles and destroyed my spleen by taking every day medications in the illusion to cure all those. So I've seen my doctor and ask her to make me a lots of blood tests etc to see what sickness I had. The results fall and it turned out that I was perfectly fine... At least physically. I couldn't believe it. She had the intelligence to ask me: 'Have you considered to see a psychologist or psychiatrist?' I realised at this moment that it was exactly what I wanted, I just needed someone to tell me. So I met this woman, a psychiatrist. I'm 21 now and I still see her, but I think not for long because I feel fine. I mean I feel as fucked up than everyone else. I guess I've been very lucky to fall on such a good doctor who always been so emphatic and human. I'm not saying that it saves my life, because probably not, but it made it bearable. And that's much that I could hope when I was 15","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I don't think this is a psychiatry problem I think it's a US problem. I got diagnosed with ADHD in high school and my experience with psychiatry was mostly positive because I wasn't labeled by someone else and forced to go to the doctor; I suspected that I had a problem and asked my mom to take me to a psychiatrist. She was even concerned about me using psychiatric drugs when I was almost 16 so I can't imagine being 8 years old and having to use heavy meds like these! It's concerning how common for students to abuse these drugs in the US, I live in Turkey and I was the only one in my high school class that got diagnosed with ADHD and used ADHD meds. Throughout my whole life I only knew one person who used ADHD meds and that person was the one to suggest I go to a psychiatrist in the first place. (thank u for making me realise sis)  At the end, after struggling immensely throughout my first 2 years of high school before getting a diagnosis I am now studying to become an engineer and I could never do that without my meds, I couldn't have even found the courage to have that as my goal. While I appreciate the treatment I got it's saddening to see other people being falsely labeled with this condition and it also hurts the rest of us who do actually have it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Nah. Allow this one. I'm speaking from a perspective of someone who has never had (at least a diagnosed) mental issue, but I think your prevaricating and non-conclusion are both deeply unhelpful.   Mental health is a sprawling issue. It's one we don't fully understand, but we do know that those people (your parents and doctors) were just trying to help you. You mention 5 diagnoses as if that's a bad thing - for all you know, the brain changes. Maybe you had 5 separate issues at different times. Maybe you needed 8 types of meds. Maybe more. What I hear from people with mental health problems is that finding the right blend is difficult. That doesn't surprise me given the number/balance of neurotransmitters in the brain.   I'd say almost any medical diagnosis begins with 'This person feels they're sick enough to be in my office right now', so they're gonna take you seriously and address you as if you need help rather than turfing you out. It always comes from a place of 'How can I help this person?' but you're making out that it's a money-making scam! Shame on you.   I notice that you hit the 'drug research is funded by drug companies' note.  Yeah, no shit. As opposed to the Boy Scouts or your second favourite youtuber funding the necessary research? It costs about a billion dollars to get a drug to market. Obviously drug companies fund drug research! Who else is gonna? It might sound scary to some but they do it to a strict set of standards.   You say it works about as well as placebos but I doubt that's true.  And even if they worked only 1% better, that's still 1000 people they help per 100k with mental health issues. Given the rate and prevalence of mental health issues, I'd say that it's worth it.   So in conclusion; I'm super sorry there wasn't one pill that helped you personally immediately, but an 8 minute video (minus 30 seconds of stigmatising mental health issues with bits of octopus) on psychiatry does a disservice to a field people don't understand well as it is and carries a certain stigma, but none the less helps countless people.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Adderall is not like high grade crystal meth, it doesnt cross the blood brain barrier as effectively. The entire point of meth, is the methylation of the amphetamine molecule so that it can use the meth group as what can be thought of as a 'key' to cross the blood brain barrier more effectively. This may not seem that important but this increase in uptake changes the effects of the drug. They are similar but its fairly different effect, can be compared to moprhine and heroine, which similarly, heroin is a form of morphine with a diaethyl group which lets it cross the blood brain barrier more effectively.   Aphetamine doesnt get produced much in the US as a recreational drug because the overwhelming supply of the pharmaceutical racemic or at least a mixture of L/R isomers. But in Europe, its very very popular, and adderall is not over prescribed, so L isomer speed is very very very popopular.   Speed or aphetamine is a lot less euphoric and easier to do things on than the much higher dose obtained from meth.   The new DSM improved a lot of your complaints.

"I really like your channel a lot and you seem pretty great. I just wish you didn't have so much dead animal imagery. It really bothers me and turns me off. It's especially disappointing when I see such disregard coming from ppl like you that  seem to care a lot about marginalized individuals (including yourself). Non human animals are conscious and aware of their surroundings and have feelings and emotions just like human animals do. If we're being honest, as far as marginalization and oppression go, non-human animals really have it the worst. This is due to the mass scale we oppress, exploit, and take their lives from them, and also the level of disregard we have for said oppression and exploitation (just to name a couple reasons).  On top of that there's the lovely cognitive dissonance that allows us to say that we love animals, and jump in if we see any type of animal being hurt in front of us, but find it completely normal to murder trillions of animals a year that wanted to live, usually after a life of massive mistreatment and while they are still technically babies.  Non human animals do not exploit us at all and dont deserve the way we commodify them in the least. Especially because we don't need to to live healthy, happy, fulfilled lives.  This is your channel and you obviously can do what you want, but it would be awesome if you included animals into your scope of individuals that deserve respect and not to be a used as props or products by humans. Even if you just didn't finger dead animals in your videos that would be an improvement. Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I hope it made some sense to you.

Personally I have taken amphetamines (Aderall) on and off throughout my high school career and I can say I took it for granted because when I was able to get the help I didn't want it, because I thought that some way some how I can fight ADD on my own. Now Im 21 with no college degree because I still have ADD and it is *worse* . I still fuck around in school and its because, *hello* , I have a disorder that makes it hard for me to retain information and stay committed to one thing for an adequate amount of time.

"I have GAD and depression, and take an SSRI for it. This has made a really positive difference in my life, but I was also cautious about the medication option - I went to a therapist, who sent me to a doctor after working with me for a few months, the doctor gave me some suggestions for non-medicinal alternatives (exercise etc) with the instruction to come back if things got worse. Well, things got worse, and eight months later I went on an SSRI and the difference a few weeks on the medication made in my life was drastic. I've since been off the drug for a couple years (pregnancy and SSRIs don't always go well together) and then got back on it when my ability to manage my anxiety and depression without the medication kind of went out the window. The dosage I'm on doesn't eliminate all the anxiety or depression, but it does mitigate it to the point where I can manage it and don't feel like crap all the time. But this requires regular appointments with my doctor every few months to check in and being aware of things that can exacerbate the problems and aware of useful coping mechanisms. Given that my emotional state through much of my childhood, teens, and young adulthood were pretty textbook GAD with a side of depression, even though it took until I was almost 24 before I finally got a diagnosis and drugs, I'm pretty sure that this is just how my brain is. I'm probably always going to need a little help to keep the anxiety from running my life, and I'm okay with that now.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As someone who was put on several medications at once at the age of twelve, with little to no understanding of what that meant, I definitely have an aversion to psychopharmacology and psychiatrists (even though I one day hope to be a PhD clinical/research psychologist).  It might just be my foggy memory of a chaotic childhood, but I don't remember the concept of side effects being adequately explained to me initially, nor the idea that I didn't have to take drugs the rest of my life.  I went into it with blind trust in the psychiatrist, who I have reason to believe was possibly incentivized by drug companies.    If I could talk to that doctor now as a competent, more educated adult, I would ask him why he put me on Seroquel, an antipsychotic, telling me that it would help my insomnia (drowsiness is a side effect of Seroquel, but not why you prescribe it).  The other major side effect of Seroquel was increased appetite, and as a teenage girl going through puberty with an already increased appetite and developing body, you can imagine how much frustration and shame I experienced.  I had an appetite that I couldn't satisfy, gained tons of weight, got stretch marks, hated my body, and had no outlet for these issues.  No, just other women lecturing me on the importance of portion control.  I definitely think some psychiatrists are too quick to diagnose and medicate patients, and children and adolescents require particular caution.  I was anti-medication for several years because of my negative experiences with meds and doctors, but I eventually realized that that stance was merely another manifestation of my black and white thinking.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"URL 'You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand. I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some people well, some people would rather die.'  Therapy, if done right, can be a mirror to compare how your mind works to others, to see if how you process the world is reasonably close to others. There probably is an objective reality, but none of us can truly see it; and none of us can truly 'see' how we process reality and information from inside our own minds.  I too am ADHD, and suffer depression after a back issue caused prolonged insomnia that seems to have caused some damage. In grade school through highschool, my treatment wasn't based on drugs, but instead working with SPED teachers and therapists to develop skills and practice techniques to compensate for my issues.  As someone who has been forced to realize my family and I are all hoarders, I am again seeking help to figure out where our minds don't process things in a sane way, and then develop skills and practice techniques to compensate for that issue. To put this in perspective, the reasonable and legitimate fear of loosing a bill, and thus incuring a late payment, has caused my father to pile all the bills into an ungodly mess that guarantee bills get lost and late payments are incurred. Something is indeed wrong with his mind that he is failing to see the forest through the trees: a pill won't fix that, but perhaps training and cognitive behavioral therapy could make the necessary adjustment in his reasoning so he will behave in a way that is more likely to result in his goals. From within my own mind, it is hard to figure out what exactly is wrong with me so as to cause my messes.  That said, you are right: prescription drugs are over prescribed, and the true causes of mental issues and the effects of said drugs are not understood enough for their common use.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"In terms if your experience with psychiatry is probably contributed lot by the point you first raised. You were from a middle class background with parents who probably had very good health insurance who didn't know what was the normal spectrum of child and teen behaviour. So they take you to a psychiatrist and since the US medical system is highly influenced by $$ and your had top health insurance the psychiatrist who is probably getting kickbacks in some form or another prescribes you unnecessary  medication. Had your parents not have health insurance/were poor/were not white you probably would have been sent on your way with a they'll grow out of it at best or a they're heading for prison at worst.   For many who are suffering crippling mental illness in the US who don't have health insurance they are very likely to not be diagnosed, end up in the prison system, self medicate or even if diagnosed struggle to recive the psychiatric or psychological help they need. It's a fucked system that can screw you either way.   Another complication is the gender/age/race etc biases in terms of diagnosis. If a particular disorder is generally thought of as affecting only one population e.g white middle class teenage girls with eating disorder or white boys with autism this results in mis/un diagnosis for many who don't fit the sterotype e.g males, poor, adults, ppl of colour with eating disorders and girls, adults diagnosed with depression/gastrointestinal issues/obeasity and ppl of colour with autism diagnosed with bipolar, OCD, shy, depression and anxiety or not at lol.  In addition US treatment is more likely to focus on providing medication rather than the psychological therapy needed. Medication is often crucial as it provides a base of being able to function enough to be able to do therapy and work on strategies to treat or at least cope with mental illness.   In terms of what defines a mental illness and pathology of normal emotions a good psychiatrist/psychologist will only diagnose someone with a mental illness if it is detrimental to social occupational and emotional functioning in multiple environments and creates distress to an individual. It's healthy to have a wide variety of emotions including sadness, anger and anxiety. It's only when these get in the way of someone living their lives that it becomes a problem that requires treatment.   Unfortunately due to the reasons above this is not straightforward as there as so many influences that can steer it awry. Ultimately tho psychiatry and psychology is crucial for many to be able to be able to survive and even thrive despite often debilitating illnesses.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"First of all, mental illnesses are not _just_ abnormal thought patterns, they have other debilitating symptoms, some of them even physical. For example, anxiety and depression are not only overthinking stuff and being sad, but they are also the inability to focus, insomnia, panic attacks, pain, exhaustion, etc. You may procrastinate brushing your teeth and getting to the shower for days or your whole body may shake with fear you do not consciously experience. I understand your concern about overdiagnosis and misdiagnosis but those two evils co-exist with the third one, which is underdiagnosis and lack of treatment.

"Psychiatry has been part of my life as far back as I can remember; I've been in and out of therapy since childhood and taking medication for my diagnoses of OCD, Tourette's, ADHD, anxiety and depression.  My mother was a professor of psychology, so I feel lucky to have someone in my life who could identify that I had mental issues from an early age and was able to find help for me.  My behavior was very textbook to those conditions, so looking back I don't think I was misdiagnosed, but I do have concerns that, were someone else in my position, surrounded by councilors and psychologists, someone would be a hammer looking at all my problems like nails.  The field of psychiatry is ultimately a very important boon for humanity, but it lies at a very weird and dangerous intersection between empiricism and subjectivity.  Everyone's case is unique down to a biological level and reacts to the same drugs and therapies in very different ways.  You're right that it's very easy to get the diagnosis you want, and we may be subconsciously attuned to think we have a problem, especially if it seems to explain what we see as moral failings in ourselves, and for some of those problems medication seems to be the best course of action.  The best thing you can do honest as possible about your symptoms rather than trying to seek a diagnosis.  Try to get a second or third opinion if you can; not all psychiatrist's experiences are the same.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There's a reason that the things you were diagnosed with are termed disorders and not diseases. A disorder requires the condition to have a negative impact on the person's quality of life.   As someone with adhd and is medicated for it, I feel that it is irresponsible to further the common misconceptions held by the general public. Adderall is not the only medication available and not all adhd medication are stimulants.   While the main ingredient of adderall and meth are both amphetamines, they are chemically different, altering their effect. It is similar to how methanol and ethanol are both alcohols and only differ by a carbon but methanol will make you go blind. However, I believe that meth can be used as treatment, in the form of desoxyn(?). A therapeutic dose of adderall and other adhd medication is much lower (and safer) than a recreational dose. The medication I take is vyvanse which metabolises into the main ingredient of adderall so its release is slower and smoother. I do not crash as it wears off.  Medication affects different people in different ways. What should have happened in your case is that your doctor should have switched your medication or tried a lower dose.   You also bring up the common adhd stereotype of the 8 year old boy who can't sit still. This is the most visible example of adhd and I wouldn't be surprised if young boys were overdiagnosed. It's definitely possible that you were misdiagnosed. Adhd is actually underdiagnosed in girls and adults (you don't grow out of it). I was not diagnosed until I was 15 because it didn't occur to anyone that I, a wellbehaved and smart girl could possibly have it, even though I never did homework, constantly forgot things, had another disorder that has incredibly high comorbidity, zoned out constantly and was often late. I hated myself until *I* came across a list of symptoms. No one, not my parents, not my teachers, not my coaches and not my doctors picked it up because I didn't fit that fucking stereotype. It took a year for my mum to make an appointment with the gp who somewhat reluctantly referred me to a specialist. Ten minutes into my first appointment, the adhd specialist said that I probably had it and I was diagnosed 6 months later.  The abuse and distrust of adhd medication makes it difficult for the people who really need it to get access. Sorry about the rant.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is plain wrong; anti-depressants do work better than placebos. Though these medications do have side-effects which should be weighed according to how desperately you need or want them. I know a fair amount about anti-psychotics, as I was blessed with the wonderful personal experience of what it is like to undergo acute psychosis. I've been on three so far, they all work the same (dopamine agonists), clozapine, aripiprazole, and seroquel (otherwise marketed as quietiapine in the UK). They all share similar side-effects with death actually being pretty high risk in the case of anti-psychotics.  You have similar things to anti-depressants like lowered mood, increased suicidal ideation (though you should report it), sickness, etc. There is also a diabetes issue with them, those taking them tend to go on to develop diabetes at a higher rate. But this is all weighed next to feeling like you're actually on the Earth and not being tortured in a dimension that is equivalent to most graphical depictions of hell.

"As someone currently in an abnormal psychology class I agree that stigmatizing these conditions is not only harmful, but disingenuous. My teacher has made sure to emphasize that many conditions are just certain expressions of normal human emotions and that having the symptoms of a certain condition does not mean you necessarily have it. An aspect of mental illness we've been emphasizing is maladaptiveness, which is when the condition negatively impacts your life. In my opinion, the OCD diagnosis you got was uncalled for on that principle alone.   Psychiatry is a very complex discipline that can be subjective, which is why getting a good psychiatrist is so important should you need one. I was also diagnosed with ADD and am currently on medication for it, but meds were not the first thing we tried. We tried therapy first and when that didn't work we resorted to meds. I think it's important for psychiatrists to advocate for a variety of treatment options and to only resort to medicating patients when they need to. There are many different approaches to psychology and the biological approach is just one of them.   I'd suggest anyone who is wary of medication first try a psychologist rather than a psychiatrist. Psychologists cannot legally prescribe medication because they lack a medical degree. There are many therapists that are psychologists rather than psychiatrists. Honestly, I just use my psychiatrist to get my meds. If I ever felt like therapy would help I'd go to a psychologist instead.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There is an unfortunate tendency to medicalising behaviours and characteristics which do not fit in with cultural norms or expectations, and either thinking of them as something to be treated or smoothed out or got rid of. I am probably on the autistic spectrum. I never bothered getting a diagnosis partly because I am not sure how it would help me in my life- I mean, are people suddenly going to start understanding me better and accepting me for who I am when I have a diagnosis like that? I doubt it. I also have suffered for years form severe depression and feel over medicalised already. And I can't say that having a diagnosis of depression means people treat me better when they find me a bit odd or grumpy or something, or understand me better or give a flying fuck about how I feel, or are at all careful about how they behave towards me. In fact, people often think it means I am an easy target. Besides, I like the way my brain works. I know it gives me a different perspective on the world. Granted a perspective a lot of people have trouble getting, but I think it's really important we don't all have brains which work the same way, or we'd all just stay the same and never develop. I have wondered about trans people and the different ways they have of seeing things, and if only they could get past constantly having to fight to exist they might be able to make a great contribution to humanity and our understanding in general. I am pleased to see it in Contrapoint's videos. Not that I want to romanticise trans people's brains and assume they all have some higher understanding, any more than I would like people to romanticise my depression the way mental illnesses often are. I just feel we are missing out on valuable alternative ways of thinking because it is so hard for trans people to just exist in this world.  The problem with psychiatry is it is very influenced by what is considered acceptable in the current culture and the over reliance on drugs. As someone who has suffered from severe depression I would not say drugs are ineffective, I know I have needed them at times. My bigger problem has been the over reliance on drugs and lack of interest in trying to understand or help beyond that. Like, somehow taking some pills is supposed to fix my life and if it doesn't that's my fault rather than the result of problems of wider society, which, of course, are much harder to fix.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The main problem with therapists and 'mental health professionals' in general is not that the scientific research they rely on is bad, but rather that they do not follow any established scientific procedure in their *practice* (ie in reaching a diagnosis and deducing the underlying cause, if we assume that it even needs to be 'deduced'). When dealing with a patient, they come up with a plausible theory based on pattern recognition (which is notoriously flawed - humans often see patterns that are not there) and then look for evidence to *support* their theory, which is the opposite of good scientific practice: you're supposed to test your theory by looking for evidence to falsify it, and checking other alternatives. In fact, once they've come up with a theory, anything that the patient says is distorted to fit that theory, and contrary evidence is rationalised or overlooked. Most doctors other than psychiatrists don't do that, because they tend to deal with conditions for which there exists more solid evidence, so their experience and training has cultivated good scientific habits in them. Psychiatrists stubbornly stick to their theories.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Lexapro (an SSRI) has been a life saver for me. I'd suffered through major depression untreated for years. When I couldn't do it anymore I asked my mom if I could see a doctor and she took me to a psychiatrist. I was afraid of psychiatry and what they would do to me.   I was prescribed the lowest dosage of lexapro they made at my mothers insistence.   24hrs after taking my first dose I had an extreme rush. I was euphoric. I'd never felt so godly happy. That faded quickly and over the months and years my mood has stabilized. I'm still depressed, but no longer suffer like I did before.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I am able to relate to you on many levels. It is almost like looking at a person I could be had I made a few different choices in my life. I just graduated with a bachelors of Art in Philosophy and am currently enrolled in a Master of Arts in English program. I have struggled with whether I am an autogynaphile who is only interested in female gender expression because I witnessed my father cross-dress as  child, or if I have sincere interest, at least one that isn't purely motivated by sex. On top of this I have a history with depression and self-deprecating thoughts and have been institutionalized because of suicide attempts and psychosis induced by lack of sleep. Yet I too do not take medication or go to psychiatrists because I have always valued independence from institutions, at least psychiatric ones. I refuse to submit my agency to the will of another individual. It has been nearly 8 years since I was hospitalized and since I was prescribed seroquel. I graduated from school without the help of psychiatry and am always finding new ways to manage my thoughts and emotions. This is typically accomplished through a combination of self-acceptance and self-control. When one fails out, I got the other to lean on.   Right now I am trying to help my mom develop mechanisms for herself so that she doesn't have to rely on psychiatric medication to help her cope. She has a bi-polar and schizophrenic diagnosis and is currently hospitalized because of an experiment we tried to get her off her medication. It is scary how she sometimes fears that I am turning on her because she is so ill and will refuse to take my calls. It is particularly scary because she is a stubborn woman who won't listen to others once she's made up her mind. Luckily she loves me and so far has let me reassure her that I haven't turned on her. All I want for her is to thrive and besides my sister, I am all she has, but she has already strained her relationship with my sister who is always busy with work and school and it just leaves me. I don't know what I can do if she decides to cut me out of her life. She might be placed into a home or something if my sister refuses to carry some of the load and my mother refuses to let me help her.  I guess that's not the worse thing that can happen. I just feel bad that I could get rejected by my mom because of her illness and the quick conclusions she comes to in her paranoid states. It is freakin' ironic because I felt like I was being a bad son while going to school, leaving her to her own devices while she becomes more and more fatigued and overwhelmed by her psychiatrists and therapists. When I finally decide to start being a good son and try to help her, she gets even more ill and begins to fear me. The only thing I can do I guess is to be patient with her and reassure her that I respect her agency and her choices when she gives me the chance. Anyways, thanks to whoever read this far. I just needed to off load this. Cheers.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think you should have done a bit more research into the effectiveness of these medications. Stimulates for ADHD are waaaaaay more effective than placebo, end of discussion. ADHD is the most easily treated mental health condition out there. Anti-depressants do much better than placebos when treating severe depression, and in combination with talk therapy out compete placebo for moderate depression. For mild depression, yes they do seem all but useless. Bipolar disorder is more about preventing episodes than treating them, which medications are quite effective at (especially two, lithium and an anti convulsant I cant remember). I think the problem is that people are being treated for mild depression because of mental health awareness. I knew someone who was going to school and getting 80%+ on their courses and taking extra courses to boot and said they had severe depression.

"I feel pretty similarly about psychiatry. When I was little I got diagnosed with ADHD and they give me aderall to 'treat' it for several months. Before that I had been put on multiple different drugs for it and none of them worked. They all either had no effect at all or they just made me sleepy. Finally when my mom found out that aderall is just meth in a pill form she took me off it cold turkey and said she was done with giving me pills. Later that day I went through a severe withdrawal but still I feel like I got lucky. My mom was pretty abusive but at least she got that right and I narrowly escaped the worst medication induced fates of many of my friends who became suicidal or permanently overweight due to a slowed metabolism from long term use of perscription drugs. Also I think a big factor contributed to over diagnosing human emotions as disorders is that for the parents get to enjoy the illusion of control over their child's abnormalness and emotional dilemmas by having a label to put on it and a majic pill that is supposed to fix everything instead of just accepting that they have no control and can't shield their children from going through the the negative mood swings that every teenager has to go through. They can't accept that it is normal and part of growing up. That might also be tied to larger societal expectations that everyone behave in a similar cookie cutter manner and that if your child doesn't fit that mold then they don't just have a different temperament. They have a 'disorder.' ADD and ADHD can serve as good examples of that. I personally don't think ADD kids are disabled so much as they just learn differently and are wired to perform certain types of tasks better than others and so they naturally gravitate towards those tasks. Yet another layer to this I have wondered about is whether or not some emotional disorders should be seen as diseases in their own right or if they should be seen as symptoms of deeper problems with the environment. For example, what if depression is not always a disease but a natural reaction to shitty circumstances that anyone would get depressed by if they were in the same situation? If we don't take that possibility into account then treating someone with a shitty life induced depression as mentally ill will not actually fix the problem and may even make them feel worse.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I attempted suicide twice. Second time I was taken to a psychiatric hospital, stayed there a few weeks. Antipsychotics, SSRIs, lamotrigine and some nootropics have helped immensely. I live a peaceful life now. Psychiatry isn't perfect, but it did very much save my life.

Are they keeping you from being able to achieve your goals, maintain relationships, or otherwise inhibiting your ability to live a healthy/fulfilling life?

"Huh. I was prescribed Seroquel for anxiety as well. It made my anxiety levels go through the roof. I told my doctor so he upped the dosage and told me to just keep taking it. I eventually ended up with anxiety so bad that i spent a weekend huddled up in the dark, unable to go outside or even turn the lights on, convincing myself that suicide was the only way to escape from it.  There was a little voice in the back of my mind telling me 'it's just the medication doing this. Just ride it out and you will be fine.' So, i did. I stopped taking the medication immediately and spent the next couple of weeks feeling pretty fucked, but still better than was i was feeling prior.  I remember when i went to see the doctor, in the waiting room, on the inter-television network that just shows doctor related commercials, there were constant commercials stating things like 1 in 3 people has a mental disorder and encouraging people to see their doctor for anything. When i reflected on what seeing my doctor and appointed therapist was like, i realised that they didn't really give a fuck. The doctor just wanted to write a prescription and tell me to see him in 2 weeks. Just in and out of his office asap with him doing as little work as possible. My therapist just wanted to listen to me talk, but he didn't really provide any insight or say anything to help me overcome my problems. He would occasionally spout a couple of technical terms, like 'cognitive dissonance' (which i remember rolling my eyes at every time. It felt like a buzz word of 2016), almost out of context some times, to try and convince me of his education. But mostly it was just, 'Keep talking about anything. Come back next week. Don't forget to pay at the counter on the way out' (not literally, but that was what the whole experience felt like).  My whole experience with 'Mental health services' felt like it was just a revolving door system designed to get a high volume of patients in and out, with little effort, to maximise profits and pedal drugs. They didn't even warn me of the potential negative effects of the shit they were pushing on me and payed no attention to my concerns that it was making me feel worse.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I went undiagnosed with ADHD until I was in 26.   By the time I reached that age my self esteem was terrible, because that's what happens when you have executive function problems and you don't know it. I didn't understand why I couldn't just *do* things like other people could. (If you're reading this and don't know what executive function is, please look it up. It's not something that's discussed enough.)   I was misdiagnosed with depression when I was 13, and that diagnosis stuck well into my adulthood. It got to the point where I was suicidal and turned to my doctors for help. I was diagnosed with ADHD. It was not a quick process. I had to take many tests, and go through hours of counseling. Finally my doctor agreed to medicate me (along with consistent counseling). Ritalin changed my life. My 'depression' almost immediately went away. I had a working memory. Tasks with multiple steps didn't overwhelm me. Tasks didn't have to be overly stimulating in order for me to do them. I enjoyed things again. I could get lost in a book, or zone out into a lame TV show.   And there are days when I go without taking my meds, and I'm just fine. Spacier, yeah. A little melancholy. I mostly feel like I felt before I started taking the meds. But it's not the same as coming down from 'high grade crystal meth.' Not even remotely. I know you're talking about your own experiences, but that's a dangerous misinformed statement that stigmatizes ADHD meds.  I have been in counseling from the time I was 5 years old. I have textbook ADHD (although I am a cis woman, so there's another layer to it). I sincerely believe that the stigma surrounding 'over diagnosing' is what caused me to go without a diagnosis. Going without a diagnosis ruined my acedemic career.   I'd suggest you check out the channel 'How To ADHD.' Even assuming you don't have ADHD, she does a great job of breaking down some of the misconceptions about it.  I understand that this video is older. I'd be curious what your thoughts would be now.

"A lot of people dont know how antidepressants work, or why they have 'suicidal attitudes or thoughts' as a side effect. The brain works in a very sophisticated, yet simple way for the most part: receive information, translate information, react to information. This information forms pathways in our brain, and the more popular pathways get 'bigger' in a sense. The brain also learns to respond to certain types of information with different chemical outputs i.e. serotonin, dopamine, etc. An 'addiction' is just a really strong dopamine pathway, and 'depression' is a really strong pathway that tells the brain to react in a negative way. Certain chemicals are released when something bad happens to give us these 'emotions', and if the brain develops strong pathways to that reaction, you become depressed.  This is where antidepressants come in. Antidepressants work by counteracting the chemical balance your brain releases to cause depression, but everyone's brain is different. One type of antidepressants will work for some people and have the opposite effect on others.   That's why suicidal thoughts is a side effect, because if it's wrong for your brain it can imbalance those chemicals.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'Bad' emotions are just emotions. However when it comes to a psychological disorder, it's best to try find a treatment. Sometimes a medicine is the thing that helps, at least in my case. I'm depressive and began going suicidal to the point that I was spending days on end without eating or drinking water... And after months of psychotherapy and seeing a psychiatrist once or twice in the meantime, I got a treatment that really made me see the difference, and my life is better now, It alleviated the symptoms so I could live my life and work to improve myself. All is fine and dandy now <3. Sometimes medicine doesn't work for some people, but there is always another way of treatment... But the thing is, I saw what was happening to me and I went out to seek it for myself because I couldn't bear that life and I wanted change.  What it looks to me is that you were just pushed around because your parents were just not comfortable with the person you were becoming, and wanted anything to manipulate you into being something they were pleased with. And that actually happened to me when I was a teen, but it seems to me that you had the bad luck of encountering the shittiest psychiatrists and psychologists who just abused you with a fuck ton of pills for no reason at all =/","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"lol yeah, additional point that psychiatric abuse is so institutionally *easy* that I know far, FAR more people who have gotten WORSE mentally from seeing a shrink(including myself) than who have been genuinely helped.  Some things cant Really be 'cured' or 'treated' anyway- Ive been dissociating my Entire life for no particular reason. My earliest memory is being like three and thinking to myself that I didnt really exist and neither did anything else but id go along with it anyway. I Just Live Like This. Any treatment genuinely makes it Worse. Theyd very likely dump antipsychotics on me if I was honest and then id be totally unable to work or function through the haze of expensive medication.  And also that 'normal human emotions' bit. ESPECIALLY with the rate of depression in the marginalized- we are upset at life in general because life is opposed to us at all times! Thats a normal human emotion! Hyperviligant and scared of people? An appropriate response to the fact that anyone can turn on you for being queer or trans or non-christian or anything else! I say a post on tumblr awhile back that really put my distaste for CBT vis a vis longstanding/lifelong trauma/bullying/opposition into words. It explained that it was similar to gaslighting because they tell you 'people arent out to get you' 'you are safe' 'not everyone is going to hurt you' because no. People ARE out to get us queers and we have to be sure and censor Everything we say to people we arent out to. We are NOT safe under Trumpfuck. We Cant KNOW that because we dont know if any new stranger isnt secretly an altright evangelist ready to bring lynching back in style. Having these beliefs is less 'warped thinking' and more a survival tactic. And trying to gaslight us into thinking everything is alright and dosing us with meds that hardly work or work Very VERY badly and make you unable to function in other ways isnt making the problem of oppression and being sad or angry about it go away!

"I think you mixed something up in this video.  It is not, that Psychiatry itself is problematic. Some emotional states are certainly, or should certainly not be, part of the everyday experience as a human beeing. Such as beeing suicidal or selfharming. Stuff like Anorexia or heavy Depression really do threaten your live and should not be marginalized by not calling them illnesses, because they are. And they need to be treated, sometimes with medication. The thing, that kind of got in your way, is your more or less strong dissapproval of prescription drugs, resulting from your own bad experiences. But the thing here is that america has a gerenal problem with overprescribing drugs, not just in the field of psychiatry. The american Opioid crisis is one of the bigger symptoms of that. So I can see, why you are cautios about psychiatry especially regarding your experiences as a child, but it is important to see them in the bigger context, because it is not the psychiatry, which is the problem! In fact the stigma, that still lies on psychiatric treatment does a lot of damage, so please don't blame the medical field for mistakes that are made by the gouvernment.

"My entire family has chronic anxiety and depression issues, among others, and I have a lot of high needs foster siblings, so I've seen every side of this argument play out in real life. My brother threw insane, off the wall tantrums until he was almost 3, and doctors wanted to prescribe antidepressants. My mom refused, which was undoubtedly the right choice for him. His anxiety induced tantrums came from sensory sensitivity and an inability to communicate, and they started to dissipate on their own once learned how to talk. On the other hand, my one adopted sibling has been on ritalin since they were 3, which is undoubtedly the right choice for them. When trying to talk to them, you could actually see them trying their fucking hardest to focus on you and engage with you, and be unable to. It was really sad to have a kid who wanted so badly to focus and engage and just couldn't. Ritalin helped immensely. You can also compare me to my older sister. She tried all sorts of psychiatric drugs to manage her depression and mood swings, but what she really needed was help working through a sexual assault experience. The drugs didn't really help, the sexual assault centre did. Myself on the other hand... I have chronic anxiety that ranges anywhere from being mildly uncomfortable to being absolutely crippling. When I get on the right mix of meds, the symptoms completely disappear. I've had this my whole life, there's no one incident I can go back to to work through to make it go away. I wish I had found psychiatric medication so much earlier. Like, back when I was 12 earlier. My life would have been very different. The key to diagnosing and deciding on treatment needs to be: what's causing it, and how detrimental is it to your ability to live your every day life? How detrimental it is will determine whether or not it really is a medical condition and not just emotion/personality, and the cause will help point you to the correct treatment. Thankfully, more and more psychological treatment regimens are following that model, rather than jumping straight to medication.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's very interesting to watch this - I'm about your age, I remember Evanescence. I grew up with serious anxiety and depression, but in the UK this was dismissed as 'being a teenager' - despite my observation that other teenagers seemed to spend less time hiding under desks hyperventilating.

"I find this interesting because your experience has basically been the exact opposite of mine:   (under the cut for depression, suicidal ideation + attempt, flight arrest, general mental illness, and length)   I suffered from severe undiagnosed depression that I say started at age 10 because that's a convenient number (and sixth grade is when I tried to run away from home, ostensibly so that I wouldn't have to do homework, which is what the adults around me heard, but really because I was, even then, utterly fucking exhausted and convinced that my inability to summon the sustained energy to do things I hated on not enough sleep was somehow a moral failing and I was therefore a terrible person. It's just a good thing I didn't know how to conceptualize suicide at that age, because absolutely nobody did anything or even seemed to notice much. Anyway). It's very likely it's just always been there, though, that my brain hasn't worked right at all, ever, and even if I'd had the ideal Utopian upbringing I would still be tired all the time and think I was a horrible person for existing. I attempted suicide when I was 16, and it still took me two and a half more years, and going to college across the country, to realize that maybe I wasn't just amazingly shitty at dealing with normal things that everyone goes through.  The thing is, though, that I did get tested for depression. Multiple times. I even saw a therapist for a while, though I don't really remember much of it. But because I had functionally never been not depressed, I scored very low on the 'do you feel more X than normal?' questions, so clearly, I must not have depression. (Side note: when I take the MHQ-9 out of the blue, I usually score around 11-13. When I actually keep a running tally of the number of days I feel tired and shitty, I score around 25. The test is out of thirty. It is a badly designed test.) If literally anyone had been quicker to medicate me, I could have been saving literally YEARS of being told, by my own brain, that this was just the cover charge for living and I had better get used to it, and in fact that everyone else was obviously used to it already so I was just being a whiny little snowflake who needed to suck it up because it wasn't like I was anything special. I used to wish I had depression so that I would be 'allowed' to have the symptoms of depression, instead of what was clearly happening, which was that I was very bad at being a person. When I was in elementary school I used to fantasize about committing a crime so that I would get to go to jail and then I wouldn't have to do anything but lie there and stare at the ceiling all day. (I had a rather shaky concept of jail, but I was like eight, and I'm white.)  I don't know how to fix this in a way that doesn't result in more of your problem. I really don't. I don't remember much of high school, because I was so tired - usually just the worst moments - and even if I did, there's a 0% chance I would have the objectivity to see what other people saw when they looked at me, be able to match that to what was actually happening, and generalize to find signs of that in other people. I don't know how to design a written questionnaire such that a scared child who hates themselves, wants to die, and is desperately ashamed of it will accurately answer (at least, not in a way that doesn't involve lying to them). I don't know. I know that probably 95% of my attitude and outlook on life is the drugs I'm taking, and that becomes horrifyingly apparently when I go off them. I know that if you gave a neurotypical person my particular medical cocktail, they'd probably be just as miserable on them as I am off them. I don't disagree with you as such, I just... thought I should share. Maybe it will help someone else, I dunno.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I don't really agree with much in this video (which is a surprise because I've loved every other video you have as I've caught up with your channel), or with the idea of there being a value-judgement in calling something a disease. I do agree that they aren't *diseases* per se, but rather syndromes, or clusters of symptoms. However, there's only a value-judgement in calling a mental illness an illness because there's a stigma to chronic illness, and we can attack that stigma at the core rather than refuse to call illnesses what they are.  I think treating mental illness as illness, no different than physical ailments, should help to reduce stigma. The mind and body are one, the separation is an illusion. My anxiety causes migraines and IBS flare ups, my depression causes fatigue and jaw-clenching. The mind and body are one, all the systems in the body affect each other. Thoughts and feelings are physical things, feelings hormonal changes and thoughts the firing of neurons and various neurotransmitters.   All that said, the psychiatric industry is currently just a few steps north of evil. We need integration with the rest of the medical field, universal healthcare, more personalized medicine, more coordination with doctors for non-mental ailments that may affect mental health and vice versa, and much much much less financial incentive. And I'd like ability to repeal a diagnosis if you get a second opinion. That absolute power that current psychs have, to decide whether or not a client is 'insane', is frightening. Also, please, fewer parents in psych! Easy for abusers to manipulate a conversation, harder for kids to open up about abuse.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The drugs are only slightly more effective than placebo because it often takes multiple drugs to find the right one. If you give 100 depressed people a drug, it's the perfect fit for 20 of them. The rest, in the real world, would get shuffled along to the next pill until they found the right one. In a study, the result gets averaged, and the drug looks ineffective. But the real issue is that the skill set of a psychiatrist lies precisely in the activity the studies cannot replicate: finding the right pill.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Several months lather, when my mom ask me something while i was playing, she figure out that i couldn't hear her at all when she talked to me behind my back. So, she bring me to the doctor, it turned out to be, that i was utterly deaf. I couldn't hear a damn thing, and i needed inmediate surgery in order to get my hearing to work again.   Thankfully, the surgery ended up great. So, what happened was that i learned lip reading for myself, during my periodic hearing loss. And that was the cause of my 'learning disabilities'.  After that, i didn't have any problems in school, i quit the drug (that i hated, btw) thanks to a recommendation of my doctor The psychologist never admitted her error tho...

The first retired and the second died of a heart attack while on his tread mill. That was sad, because I really liked him. I would be skeptical to if I was given the meds your given as a small child.

"This is an excellent video and touches on a number of important critiques of psychiatry which are always worth analysis. I say that as a marginal YouTuber and a crusty old shrink who has dabbled in philosophy of psychiatry. At the heart of psychiatry, as you rightly point out, there is an inescapable tension between facts and values. DSM disorders don't cross the threshold into disorder unless they cause clinically significant functional impairment or distress. What constitutes distress or impaired function is sometimes really obvious, and the vast majority of us would agree; but many, many cases lie on different sorts of boundaries where, ultimately, a judgement call has to be made. Ideally, this is part of an ongoing negotiation between doctor and patient, to the degree possible. Would absolutely love to discuss some time if you were so amenable.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's amazing to me that psychiatry can both at the same time overmedicate and overlabel and underlabel people in different circumstances.  I had a very opposite problem I have PTSD from childhood trauma (my dad was a drug addict and therefore a shitty father) and I was told 'this is normal' by multiple doctors even after admitting to attempting suicide and engaging in self-injurious behaviour.  it took essentially me and my mum saying to my GP we're not leaving until you do something, so I got referred to an adolescent paediatrician who focused on mental health issues and had an outreach clinic in the innercity neighbourhood I lived in.  I think psychiatry overlabels middle class people, but still has a huge problem dismissing the lower classes (even though with things like PTSD, genetic factors, and mental illness reducing the ability to earn money lower class people tend to have more mental illness when properly screened.) there is also a fair amount of racism, I know my dad's mental health issues were largely dismissed by people considering him to simply be a 'Drunk Indian'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm surprised to see a video from contra that is so poorly researched.   Manic depression isn't just mood swings that goes away in minutes. The manic and depressed state may last weeks or months before switching. And it has to cause significant debilitation in the person's life, like he watches an episode of kitchen nightmare and then actually goes to the bank for a loan to open up a restaurant.  The reason anti-depressant causes more suicide isn't necessarily the anti depressant itself. The risk of suicide is heightened whenever someone with depression begins to improve.  When that person has enough motivation to get out of bed but still hopeless enough to want to kill themselves, you have the perfect ingredients to act on a suicidal ideation.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Truth is, we don't know much about people's moods or where they come from. Religion, meditation, and various coping strategies of all sorts are at least as useful as the meds the witch doctors are selling. The problem, of course, is that if you're really bad off, and you can't function, you can't use any sort of coping strategies effectively. Short term use of psychoactive meds can be useful for people who are in crisis - the research supports this. But long-term use hasn't been shown to be more than marginally useful, and the side effects are often significant.  I had a friend who suffered from 'social anxiety.' She had a job, she was good at it, she wrote bad novels (I read them and lied) and was generally capable of coping with life. She was 'flaky,' but I liked her for all that, I'm a little odd myself. But she was certain that her life could be better if she started getting psychiatric help. The doctor put her on various drugs, which gave her acne, put an unhealthy amount of weight on her with alarming speed, caused cramping and insomnia. But worse, she stopped writing. She wasn't a gifted writer, but it had always been meaningful to her. She said just couldn't focus on it under the influence of the drugs.  She mentioned the side effects to her psychiatrist, who put her on other drugs. With similar results. She started to blame herself, felt that she wasn't 'trying hard enough' in therapy, a ridiculous conclusion that wasn't helped when her psychiatrist told her she was being 'resistant.'  Then her insurance ran out. She couldn't afford the meds, so she suddenly discovered what happens when you cold turkey off this stuff. It was spectacularly bad for her. I spent a month basically keeping her away from sharp objects and street dealers, and helping her cope with the sickness.   She never got over the experience. Now, she's convinced she's a failure, her anxiety is worse than ever since she thinks she can't be helped, and she didn't leave her apartment for a year. She's never been able to go back to work, and she drove everyone away who tried to stick with her. Including me.  Eventually, her utilities were shut off. We had a blizzard, so I went over to check on her despite her telling me to stay away. She didn't have a phone anymore, so I had to go over, clear the snow away from the door, and knock. I heard her moving around, crying, so I opened the door. Yeah, I broke in. So sue me. I thought she was hurt. Stupid of me, I know, but this was before we all had phones in our pockets.  The apartment was freezing. No heat, no power, no water. She wouldn't even speak to me, she just went fetal on the couch and cried. I called the ambulance, and stayed until they arrived.   The State Hospital was a snake pit, and she came out just as bad once the Medicare ran out. She's gotten somewhat better, she pays the bills from her disability check, and she has recently gotten to the point that she can come to the door when the grocery delivery comes.

Heck, for something truly random, there's inpatient facilities out there now with therapy goats. That's right. Therapy. Goats. Japan's also doing some pretty edgy stuff with discovering certain molecules they've extracted from Japanese cypress trees that help the brain battle depression and boost the immune system, and the effects of which are a lot more subtle.   Also the suicide risk in antidepressants Are NOT because they increase how suicidal you feel. Antidepressants increase suicide risk because depression fatigues you and makes you less able to carry out plans. The fatigue tends to fade before mood improves, so in that early stage of treatment you now have the energy to carry out a plan to harm yourself, but haven't yet lost the willingness to do so.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There's a good Ted talk on how we treat Schizophrenia and the way that we see it as a malicious thing crazy people have. The person giving the talk had received a high levelled degree in psychiatric study and they suggested it was probably thanks to their schizophrenia giving her half the answers. Throughout the talk she talks about how she was able to learn to live with unmedicated schizophrenia as she realised that the voices were in response to her brain rationalising emotions, much like how the brain will fill in the blank in optical illusions, text or memories if there are pieces of the puzzle missing. So when her anxiety, which was due to events in her childhood, made her feel heightened stress for no real reason one of her voices would start to speak saying things like 'everyone hates you', 'he's looking at you funny' or  'don't leave the house' which sounds like the thoughts of a malicious entity when in fact it was the brain experiencing emotions out of seemingly nowhere and rationalising the emotions with personalities and voices. She also recognised that whilst the voices would be aggressive it did seem that underneath it the phrases could be interpreted as the brain seeking what it thought was best for them. The talk is by Eleanor Longden and I've kind of posted my interpretation of what she said, I advise you, dear reader, to actually watch the talk rather than take my interpretation of someone else's dealing with mental health.

"I think one of the hardest things to consider in psychiatry is how imperceivable everything is. When you're dealing with say, electricity, you can look at what you're doing directly, see how Wire A attaches to Item B, and and what's causing problems and whatnot. Treating disease is like treating an extremely complex machine. You can know what's making you ill (like viruses and bacteria) but not be able to interact with it, or at least not without severely damaging what's around it. Either of those things are easier than psychiatry though. Unlike pneumonia or influenza, most of your symptoms aren't outwardly seen, and the things making you ill can't be put under a microscope and observed. Using the electrical analogy, making a mentally ill person healthy can be like trying to rewire your basement without the benefit of a flashlight.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Well, we can't really put value on that...I mean, it IS statistically abnormal, but can we decide if it's bad for you? Surely not!'  I'm not a doctor, but 'disease' probably has some kind of definition, maybe even something talking about the well-being of the patient, danger or detriment to others etc.  Yes, sometimes it's not simple to determine how bad or not bad some condition is, but let's not throw out the concept of a disease (even a mental one) completely!

"Before anyone reads this understand that I went through the Australian medical system which -from what I can gather- is less trigger happy with prescriptions. Prescriptions cost less, and my psychiatrist has often joked to me about attempts by pharma companies to market to Australian Psychs. The way they market isn't as direct so as a general rule doctors are less susceptible to marketing. That being said there's still the issue of the evidence doctors use being biased. I was diagnosed with ADD/ADHD at 20 yrs old, I've taken Ritalin (under a different brand and formulation though) for four years. The reason I mention that is that Adderall is illegal in Australia. Adderall is made up of mixed amphetamines, and while Ritalin is very similar, it doesn't have the same addiction/dependence factor. Adderall contains dextroamphetamine which has the same effect as Meth, albeit without the same mechanism of action which can cause serious issues with dopamine that meth has. As for my own relatively positive introduction to psychiatry: Personally I can point to a period of my life where I suffered suicidal depression (at 17 yrs old) and was brought out by an anti-depressant. Mind you it wasn't an SSRI like Zoloft, it was a tetracyclic anti-depressant that worked a lot faster and didn't have the same level of side-effects. As for anti-psychotics, I've discussed this at great length with my psychiatrist. The conclusion he's come to is that when doctors are presented with a young patient who's suicidal, sedation may be the only tool at their disposal. A doctor will always see more benefit in prescribing when there's a chance of suicide, and I find that hard to fault. The other point my psych made was that like any other field of science medicine is dynamic: there's always an optimism that better treatments will present themselves.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I know this is an old video but I really appreciated hearing this - I've spent the last couple of years alternating between 'I probably have an anxiety disorder of some kind' and 'I don't really like the concept of mental illness because in a different society/culture I wouldn't necessarily be seen as 'ill' and its only an illness if I believe it negatively impacts my life, which it only does because society expects me to behave and think a certain way, and besides there is no 'correct' or 'perfect' human in evolutionary terms anyway'... People around me want to diagnose me but I find it much more helpful to say 'I experience a great deal of anxiety' than 'I HAVE anxiety' and a lot of that has to do with what you were saying about pharmaceutical drugs and what we classify as a medical condition","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"The choice between changing social structures and prescribing medications in response to poor performance in those social structures is, I think, very relevant to autistic people. While some people seek to 'cure' autism through psychiatric meds and behavioral abuse (that's not how developmental disorders work), others seek to 'prevent' it through a lack of meds and behavioral intolerance (also not how they work). Truthfully, I think the issues we face are caused mainly by a world structured in a way that is difficult for us to navigate. If somebody has a hard time looking others in the eye, should they really be trained and medicated to do it, or can we just stop expecting eye contact?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I mean there's a lot of things that are really disorders that need to be treated, cancer is as natural as depression if you think about it. How much as our bodies work they just sometimes don't there's a lot of complex things happening in them. There's different levels of every disorder in some it influences a lot of more of their life than others.  For me therapy has done just so much, but only when I found a good therapist.  I've had a bad therapist and a therapist who just wasn't right for me, I think it's the same as any doctor really. When I was younger I was swinging between hyperactivity and staring out a window unable to hear a thing, I'd be playful and nice or I'd throw temper tantrums and break things out of anger, I lost things, I was bullied relentless, etc. Really I was the poster child for adhd. But when my parents took me to a psych to get diagnosis she said I had bipolar disorder. I did have a lot of issues with moods. But the truth was I had awful horrible extreme adhd. I didn't get a diagnosis until I was 17 it might have been fine if I wasn't such a serious case tbh. Adhd can cause anxiety and depression in ppl and boy did it ever. The first therapist I saw to get on antidepressants was just....  hm. Namby pamby is what my mom called her. She was just too nice to help me really. My current therapist is the best. She forces me to open up and helps me look at things I didn't see. The force thing sounds bad but I really need, for most of my life I not only would refuse to ask for help but I'd refuse to say the word b/c I wanted to be so independent. The medications I'm on really do help, they do a lot for me, it might just be a placebo effect but if it works it works no need for that to be a bad thing.  The reason I think therapy works so well for me is that I know I have problems and I reflect on my issues a lot. I know whats wrong with me 85% of the time but I just don't know what to do to fix it. My doctor helps me would with that and not just things about my mental illnesses but with my relationships and school and just a lot of things I was struggling with before. Therapy really only works for people who admit they have problems and are willing to do the work to fix those issues. Medicine works for chemical imbalances. I do think that some doctors push medicine too much (my current psych wants to give me like three new meds every time I see her, you just have to know when to say no) but it's hard too know what works. There is no cure all for everyone there's different  things that work for each person really. It's about finding what does. There is a lot of issues in psychiatry though it's not all help and rainbows. it's affordable to people who aren't middle class or above, which often people with disabilities have issues keeping a job because of their issues and if they have no money to fix those professionally they're just on their own, it's a bad cycle. A lot of doctors are actually pretty prejudiced against certain disorders, a lot of people with mood disorders (based on ppl I know and how the doctors I've seen have reacted when I've talked about people I know with mood disorders) have said that they felt the doctor was really negative about their disorder and said things that really just made the person feel worse. A lot of people who are actively suicidal don't want to tell their therapist because they're worried about being involuntarily committed. If a person can't tell their doctor about this disease that's potentially deadly they can't get help and that's a huge problem. Really mental hospitals in themselves are pretty shitty in so many cases. 1 person out of the 5 I know who've been committed said it helped, the rest honestly all have trauma connected to their stay. Mental hospitals are such a big issues that really isn't talked about enough.  There's positives and negatives but I think it's a huge mistake to just disregard psychiatry. It does save lives. But there are bad things about it too. There's horror stories in any medical field in all honestly. I could definitely tell some about my pcos. Doesn't mean medical fields should be treated like mistakes. It's a big issues and I hope people watching this video aren't scared away from help they may need to get.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I feel compelled to give you my life story???? So here goes.  I knew something was wrong with me in elementary, and I got a childhood diagnosis of ADD (now ADHD by proxy) not because I was hyper (although i did have a horrible personality) but because I physically could not do my homework no matter how hard I tried. My parents tried every non-medication technique they could think of to improve my grades but mom ended up just doing all the hard parts for me. I got put into a special grading regimen that allowed me to do more testing and less work, to prove efficiently that I was actually learning without having to struggle through mountains of late assignments, and in some cases to be able to study subjects alone with a textbook and worksheet. That was the entire reason I graduated high school. Somewhere along the way I started taking Concerta (after a mishap with Ritalin) and it felt like angels serenading me from the heavens.  My problem wasn't just homework-- I was barely able to do anything with personal hygiene, I barely ate, I barely exercised, and I couldn't even focus on video games. I was already writing fiction and drawing comics by puberty, but I could barely do a thing with them and completed almost no real finished pieces. I had a lot of ambitions-- I wanted to be a stand-up comedian, a marine biologist, a voice actor, an astronaut, an archaeologist, etc. Or at east run a kickass lemonade stand and do art commissions as a side job while flipping burgers for the corporate overlords. I was actually able to score an art commission in grade school but I wasn't able to follow through. I repeated basic mathematics over and over, I was too shy to get my foot in the entertainment industry door, too fat for even the military (I thought my mental health would be improved by strict schedules, and I needed the money), and too late into the recession for even mcdonalds. I ended up not going to college, so I could recuperate in the years following highschool, but I just ended up homeless when i had to move out of my mom's place due to stress.  I've been suicidal since age nine. I've always hated myself. I briefly stopping taking concerta to apply for the military, but without it, it was so hard to get back on that I became an adult in the meanwhile. I used to say it was like 'looking for your glasses' i.e. you need the thing to get the thing. I ended up reapplying for it but by then I had switched doctors and concerta had been bumped up to a schedual II drug-- they literally gave me a form with opium crossed out and concerta written in-- because of children who had been *misdiagnosed* selling their extra pills for skateboard money, to neurotypical college students who used concerta to pass difficult classes. Anyway my doctor thought I was a big liar so she took me off the pills and fucked me over. at 26 years old I've been medicated for less than three. There is *no alternative to concerta.* No off-brand, no substitute, not even in canada. I got put on buproprion, but as that was a antidepressant it did nothing but make me happy-depressed. Which was just... bittersweet.  Finally I figured out I was also trans and had bipolar thanks to the internet and free healthcare. I went on T and stopped being a demon child. Still can't brush my damn teeth. Still fat. Still not practicing art. Still homeless. Still jobless. I'm now on welfare, and still don't have my damned concerta. Still haven't completed Skyrim. Or Minecraft. Or Mario 64. Or Pokemon Blue. I've always wanted to be a youtuber actually, and I probably could, but..... I literally can't. And I still hate myself.  My current diagnoses are Clinical Depression, Generalized Anxiety, ADHD Mixed Type, Bipolar III, and also maybe BPD? That ended up on a report somewhere and I never asked about it. Currently my only medication is testosterone, and..... it's awesome, but I'm still super disabled. At this point I ID as crazy/insane, I just can't deal with anything sometimes... most of the time. Especially right now. I don't know if I have any sort of point, except that i think even if there was a perfect medication, which concerta isn't, it would probably be treated like opium and denied to the people who need it the most and used to drug misbehaving children and black market sold to struggling academists. Maybe my account of things helped someone somehow. I hope so. Bye. I love your videos.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I realize I'm a year late to the party but I just found this channel so whatever.  For the past two years I've been working as a Marriage & Family Therapist, so I provide talk therapy to people struggling with basically the whole gamut of diagnoses in DSM.  I talk to people for an hour at a time, getting deep into the weeds not just with their 'symptoms' but with their whole background, taking into account race, culture, socioeconomic status, gender, LGBT+ status, and many other things besides.  Even then, I was trained to be extremely cautious about offering any diagnosis, and extremely skeptical of the 'medical model' that treats clients as sick people with some kind of disease we can diagnose and 'cure.'  The only reasons to do diagnose, according to the postmodern ivory tower rhetoric of graduate school, are if the client agrees and finds the label helpful or if a label is needed to unlock access to additional services (i.e. to bill the client's insurance).  To do otherwise is considered to be 'pathologizing' the client, which is understood to do more harm than good.    I say all this to put some context to the professional environment of the vast majority of psychiatrists: like me, they are trying to understand what the client is struggling with and how to help them.  Unlike an MFT like me they don't get hours at a time to go into all those weeds.  Statistically what they get instead they get 4-20 minutes at a time, usually once a month or so.  Thus even a (very) hypothetical well-meaning, ethical, and intelligent psychiatrist is to a disturbing degree taking a wild shot in the dark about the neurochemical origins of a problem while totally ignoring all other factors (race, gender, culture, SES, etc etc etc).  This leads to rampant misdiagnosis, enrolling people in the roulette wheel of Powerful Psychotropic Drugs who should never be there and dealing out ineffective or actively harmful medication to others.    All of which is, I guess, to say that it's an extremely flawed system at best, so beware ye who enter.  The right medication in the right brain at the right time CAN genuinely be like a magic bullet that makes everything a thousand percent better, but the odds are honestly probably much higher that the effects will be slight, nonexistent, or actually harmful.  The state of informed consent around all this is absolutely dreadful.  I would recommend that everyone advocate very strongly for themselves and their own self care and mental health, because psychiatric professionals need to be held accountable for genuine positive result.  If someone doesn't know how to advocate for themselves or does not feel comfortable doing so, collaborating with another mental health professional (like an MFT) might be helpful to collaboratively develop a strategy for that sort of self-advocacy, or the therapist may be able and willing to advocate on the client's behalf.  tl;dr: Diagnosis is a total crapshoot, psychopharmacology is more of a total crapshoot than we might be comfortable admitting, and the professional practices of 'medical model' mental health treatment leave a lot to be desired.  Great video, as always.  Hope this added a least a little value to the discussion.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is why I think I switched from continuing path of going forward with women's studies or history degrees towards PhD and *gasp* a life of academia, and go back for masters in counseling. I went through similar. My mom was psych nurse, so she was tied closer to the pharmecuiticals than the counselors and social workers. At 5 it was adhd and odd given Ritalin. At 12 major depressive disorder given Wellbutrin. 13 switched Ritalin to adderal. Then 14 switched Wellbutrin to Paxil because of an ocd and generalized anxiety disorder diagnosis. 15 bipolar type 1 given lithium and serequel with Paxil and neurontin. At 21 I finally opened up after getting off lithium which made me a zombie and they all realized the truth I had severe childhood and reoccurring trauma from rapes and other sexual assault, abuse, and father suicide. Like how dumb do they have to be to not realize this shit. I felt like a science expiremebr. I am given klonopin but do not take unless severe flashbacks, panic, etc and try mindfulness and basic cognitive treatments on self. Because of all of this I thought having someone who experienced the down side of the biz (yes biz) help patients without sending to psychiatrist unless obviously schizophrenic, bipolar, etc in which medication will improve life over the risks of medication. I'm very holistic approach type. To be fair it seems from counseling stance at least, the methods are becoming more client focused and meditation based along with typical cbt or Dbt.

I'm planning on going in to psychology and it's definetly got it's issues, but I think that's because it's such a new science that we don't quite know enough yet to be solid enough in what we're doing to not just tweak medications based upon symptoms. But then again, what science or field of medicine isn't like this? I have PCOS, which is definetly a medical condition, but so much of treating it is tweaking medications and diets until your symptoms go away enough you can function as a semi normal human. I think it's not just psych that has it's issues, but all medicine in general because so much of it is individualized to each person.  Also, the thing you mentioned about anti depressants making you suicidal. The reason that happens is because, right when you go on it, you begin to have more energy, but your depression hasn't quite gone away so you have enough energy to actually go through with committing suicide.

"Late reply, to the video, and some great points were made.  Knowing what words to say can indeed guide the doctor to give you the diagnosis you are looking for. The major problem in getting an accurate diagnosis is that psychiatrists are not mind readers.  They can't X-ray your brain and tell you whats wrong.  The most common mistake is diagnosis come from confusing a mental disease from a personality disorder.  With conditions like schizophrenia, something has gone wrong.  There is an identifiable chemical imbalance that manifests systems, and there are medications to try and correct that imbalance.  With a personality disorder, everything is functioning correctly, but still yields bad results for the patient.  Personality disorders are tough because medication is very ineffective as a treatment.  Therapy is the best solution, but individuals with personality disorders are often resistant to go to therapy.  Do you have problems holding on to long term relationship with friends or family? Do you have intense outbursts of anger or depression that last only a few hours?  Crippling fear abandonment?  Substance abuse?  These are often the hallmarks of a borderline personality disorder, and it is often mistaken for other conditions such as bipolar.  Not to E-diagnose anyone, but the fact that you have had multiple diagnosis from different mental health professionals to me seems to indicate that there is indeed a mental health issue at play, but they are focusing on the wrong symptoms     Not to mention there was an aspect of yourself that you were more than likely hiding from others at the time, which probably led to a lot of social angst that others might interpret as a medical condition.  Many in the LGBTQ community who are in the closet are often diagnosed with some malady or another because the outward symptoms of anger, social withdrawal, and subsequent suicidal thoughts are all the doctor can see, and often lead to a misdiagnosis.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I worked as a behavioral technician at a for-profit hospital for about 2.5 years, and saw patients from 18 years old to 80. My dad is a practicing psychiatrist. And I can assure you that--based on what I've observed and what I've heard from my dad's 30 years experience--your dealings with psychiatry are probably the most typical kind of experience.    Most diagnoses are not really medical in nature--as you point out, they're value judgments. I have observed that these judgments are used as methods of control. The police routinely brought patients to the ER who were disorderly, perhaps had a falling out with a loved one or were already known to the authorities to be a 'problem.' From the ER, the overworked staff would see the problem and seek to extirpate him or (more often) her somewhere else--often our 48 bed hospital.   Of course, I saw sick people as well, but I would estimate that no more than 15% of the patient population was truly possessed of a medical condition--major depression, schizophrenia, psychosis, bipolar being the most powerfully debilitating and terrible to behold.  As one example of how extreme real illness can be, I met a man who thought the world was perpetually burning down. I've never felt such pity for another person in my whole life, and the tortured screams that projected from his quivering, huddled frame--all because the television was plugged in to the wall and would imminently engulf us both in flames--will follow me to the end of my days.   But most of the people I encountered were more or less normal. Plenty of drug addicts--heroine especially; domestic disputes; drunken mistakes; what was termed 'personality disorder,' ie this person is annoying and a pain in the ass... Nothing too special, except in so far as their very normality should have been so out of place!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think the real issue is how interconnected the drug industry is with the people who prescribe the drugs. While there's no real way to say for certain outside of requesting to see your doctor's/psychiatrist's bank statements, in general a good rule is to ignore the advice of any doctor or shrink who's first instinct is to give you prescription drugs. Going by my own experiences and the experiences of friends/loved ones, a good psych will never prescribe you anything on the first appointment unless they have good reason to believe you are at risk of harming yourself or others, or you specifically request it and they don't think your request is borne of addiction or hypochondria","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The 'antidepressants are no better than placebo' study was seriously flawed because it does not reflect clinical practice. Basically, each patient tested only one antidepressant, but in clinical practice most patients will try multiple medications before finding the one that works. See: URL  The NIH's STAR*D study was a much larger study which actually reflects clinical practice. URL  Hopefully at some point our understanding of Major Depressive Disorder and neuroimaging will advance enough that patients can be given the right antidepressant the first time. Currently the most that clinicians have to go on is whether the patient has any other psychiatric diagnosis which can give a clue as to which antidepressant might work best. But it's by no means an exact science.  Do I think some people have been given psychiatric drugs when what they actually need is psychological counselling? Of course. But the problem is actually one of access to psychiatry, not too much psychiatry. Proper diagnosis takes time, and a psychiatrist's time is too expensive (currently even in single payer systems, like here in the UK where patients will often only manage to see a mental health nurse, not a psychiatrist).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I know I'm real late, but I'd like to add some quick input. I'm autistic and also diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder. These are very accurate diagnoses for me - however, I also show a multitude of traits of other psychiatric disorders that have negatively impacted my life, which get ignored. I had to jump through hoops to get the diagnoses I have now, and many of my friends did as well. Even if they're clearly mentally ill, they haven't been diagnosed or had to go to great lengths to get their diagnoses. Here's the interesting bit - I'm Canadian.  There's a significantly smaller profit motive, and suddenly we have very clearly mentally ill people being denied the care they need. Flip to the US, where there's a ton of money to be made, and people are being overdiagnosed and assigned a ton of meds.  All this to say that society is incredibly capitalist and ableist and will screw over mentally ill people if there's no profit, but make a business out of harmful practices if it can turn over a few bills. But I guess I'm really preaching to the choir.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"My experience with therapists is that they went out of their way to make the point that emotions are not pathologies, and that therapy isn't about getting rid of behavior that deviates from the norm, almost the opposite, they want you to get better at accepting your own bizarre behavior.  If you have a problem you want fixed, like showing up to work late every day, they'll use their expertise to find ways to fix that, especially if you're stuck in some weird ironic delusional loop where you procrastinate in the morning because you're afraid of being late. But so far the therapists I've dealt with would have an attitude like 'yeah, I can help you show up on time, but another approach could be looking at jobs that aren't so asinine about punctuality.'  This seems to be standard expected industry practice, but I've heard enough horror stories to think that most therapists are daft and don't follow the research or currently accepted standards, and will sometimes even try to literally heal you with crystals or Reiki or something.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I think they can be helpful if handled correctly, but the issue is that people are too quick to just throw pills at the problem instead of, y'know, addressing it.   Like i grew up with ADHD and if i had know that sooner and had been treated and taught ways of coping with it i would be much better off. I probably wouldn't have dropped out and be stumbling blindly through my first years of adulthood feeling worthless. But on the other hand, the school environment i was in at the time would have treated me badly if i had an official ADHD diagnosis. It was a private school and the administrators would have jumped at any chance to isolate me from my class and eventually try to kick me out. In fourth grade a teacher screamed at me not to come to her class i was such a nuisance to them.

"I feel compelled to comment, and I may or may not be a therapist for a day job... And  know that you made this video a long time ago.   The big problem with mental health treatment in general is that it's a buyer-beware market and there are a bunch of history reasons for it. Basically, there was Freud, and then there was the DSM. DSM is basically lists. U meet enough of the list requirements, u get the diagnosis. in the 50s, we figured out that psychiatric drugs made people with severe MH issues stable enough to go home; even pick up part time work in some cases. Capitalism took over, and all the asylums closed by the mid 80s to early 90s with the idea that community MH providers would be the ones handing out the drugs like the asylums were 30ish years earlier. Capitalism under clinton made that not happen and jails/prison took over much of MH work in general... a trend that has only gotten much, much worse to this day (I may or may not work in SUD, and i can tell you that Obamacare made things only mildly better for methadone clinics in my state and not necessarily for NOT methadone types of treatments (not everyone should be on medication replacement therapies, not everyone wants them, there are plenty of other therapies out there we can try, etc.).   So to your point and your life story, it's not surprising, especially since the DSM has grown more affinity for behavior rather than innate 'personality' disorder issues in recent decades. ADD is a real thing, but the list I talked about in the DSM has an innate bias when talking about children; who will always exhibit more behaviors congruent with the list than adults and there's an incredible amount of leeway for the person doing the diagnosing; where personal values most definitely play a part in therapists who are bad at their jobs. On top of that, there's a huge push to medicate problems because... well that's a whole other set of issues I kept typing and deleting when they got longer than 5 sentences....   Essentially, most mental health problems, according to these lists, NOT all-but most, can be briefly summed up as: are you able to work for 40 hours a week? no? here's a pill/tx (treatment) that might work for you. in my line of work, which may or may not be related to these kinds of things, I've found that trauma is often at the heart of most issues and medication only sort of helps.... usually what seems to be most effective is telling patients to read philosophy, find purpose and meaning in their lives, and take their ancestors and personal responsibilities more seriously. Often times, ive found that people are misdiagnosed damn near all the time, and it takes about a month of seeing someone once a week to figure out what best diagnosis would fit them and what tx would be most effective. full disclosure, most therapists in my observation as both someone in therapy and on the other side of the desk are pretty shit. I would never tell anyone to not go to therapy, but I would warn people that they are going to have to figure a lot of stuff out on their own, be generally aware and familiar with what OTHER diagnosis's their list of behaviors would also qualify for and ask their therapist why those weren't considered, and they shouldn't be afraid to shop around 2-8 times to find a therapist they click with... which can be pretty costly, sometimes looks like drug seeking, and insurance tends to not like it; unless your 'in-house' at an agency where having a different therapist week after week doesn't really matter.   in short, it's always easier to prescribe a pill than to see someone once a week for 180 days; letting them take up 60 mins of your time and another 15-60 mins in administrative stuffs you might not always get paid to do. Also, psychiatrists will ALWAYS prescribe you something if you present them with enough problems. It isn't a malicious or generally conspiratorial thing... it's just capitalism, the nature of the DSM, and the the human organic brain laughing at western concepts of mind/body dichotomy and the pressures of ultra capitalism where mh is stigmatized because our sole value as human beings is wage labor.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Just this year I got a diagnosis of ADHD (I'm 30) and it explains a phenomena I've experienced my whole life when facing overly complex or lengthly tasks in a way that makes me go 'oh duh, no wonder I feel that' - whereas before I was at a complete loss as to why I felt so crushingly stressed out to say, be assigned a short and formulaic high-school essay or try to plan out a video game demo for fun.

"ContraPoints,  I wish to cover just one aspect of your excellent video, an aspect I had personal experience with.   I wonder how many future Scientists, Mathematicians  and Medical Researchers , not to mention brilliant artists (in all fields, painting, sculpture, dance music....) does the future loose everyday when schools force parents to medicate their kids. Though my education is STEM, I know enough to know that the majority of hyperactive children are simply bored by the curriculum at their present grade. For example a child may be biologically nine years old, but intellectually they are 14 or 15 so they are bored and / or very inquisitive and continuously ask questions way above that grade level or even above the teachers knowledge. You know how it goes as it happened to you.    My nephew was just such a child, when confronted with drugging him, my sister, was financially and educationally  able to stay home and home school him sans any drugs. He interacted and socialized with other children via little league and other sports ( I hate all sports BTW but here sports filled the necessary socialization that a child recieves when attending in a conventional school environment) His home schooling ended when he resumed a public education starting in the 9th grade. Today I am proud to say he graduates from SUNY @ Stony Brook as an Electrical Engineer (BS ), this coming Spring and has a 3.3 GPA so he qualifies for grad school.   I was ADD back in the 60's but thank God there was no such diagnosis. I attended Catholic school and you simply took a beating to make you 'sit still and shut up'. I myself am glad the ADD diagnosis did not exist then nor the mind numbing drugs. I know I was ADD then as I am diagnosed with Adult ADD today.   Thank God you seem not to have been damaged as your academic and creative achievements demonstrate.  But what about all the other children who were as fortunate as you?. What great achievement would they have possibly made in the future if not for being drugged zombies at age 9?    BTW, is that you really playing the piano in some of your vids.?

In general, my experience with psychologists is that they're well meaning, but they haven't got what it takes to treat a very mouthy and informed, gifted, autistic trans NB person with a history of depression and an eating disorder, and I always end up extremely disappointed that *again* they fall short. All the other psychiatrists I had... I could've murdered them if I didn't get away from them on time.

"This video is fantastic. Ive been diagnosed with everything under the sun, and while I do consider my depression/anxiety debilitating and severe without maintaining a certain vitamin regimen, the thing that saved me was simply St Johns Wort and 5-htp combined with exercise and a healthy diet. I also take fish oil and multivitamins, but I know its mainly the 5-htp st johns wort combo that allows me to feel normal. Otherwise I tend to lose all ability to function and go days feeling like life is pointless and hopeless. I used to drink constantly 2 or so bottles of wine a night to cope, and I felt really out of control of my life, but i couldn't bring myself to care. The side effects during hangovers were mainly even more extreme versions of anxiety though, so I had to figure out a different way to medicate in spite of trying medication after medication starting at 15 years old. I've been diagnosed with OCD, depression, generalized anxiety, ADHD, and been on at least 6 different meds. None of the meds ever helped, in fact they seemed to make me feel even less rational and more hopeless. I still drink often, dont get me wrong, but it's a lot more manageable when you're not drinking because you don't care if you live or die anymore and I don't do it just to escape from the hell of being unable to feel happy. I also take naltrexone which stops the opioid reaction in the brain you get from alcohol, which I would totally recommend. You can still enjoy drinking and get drunk, but its easier to be rational about it. Theres no sense ending up in a hospital due to withdrawals some day down the road. Contrapoints, I would really recommend giving 5-htp and st johns wort a shot if youre still even slightly chronically depressed. I recommend it to anyone I hear is struggling with depression/anxiety because its just so shitty living like that when a simple herb can make such a difference. Youll feel the effects within 2-3 days, and you can get it at walmart, trader joes or online. I find it amazing that this herb has made such a difference for both myself and my brother, and we both felt awful and completely not ourselves on the cocktail of medications psychiatrists and doctors kept giving us.

"So, I grew up in an extremely religious working-class family that didn't believe mental illness was a thing even though damn nearly my entire paternal extended family suffers from addiction issues and/or some form of comorbid psychiatric disorder. I had my first bout of depression at 14 years old, and it took ten more years, wrecked credit, and multiple suicide attempts before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I have a very classic presentation of the illness; it took the first person I saw all of fifteen minutes doing intake to be like 'yep you gots the manic depression, sucks to be you'. I've been taking medication for it off and on ever since.  The point I'm trying to make here is that even when you have the thing they say you do, these drugs *fucking suck* to have to take. The knowledge that people have been prescribed psych meds when they didn't need them honestly makes me cringe, because long-term use should only be a thing if you absolutely NEED long-term medication. It's like taking drugs for any other serious condition, the side effects can really fuck you up, sometimes permanently. I also know several people who were misdiagnosed with psychiatric illnesses, or had an underlying issue that could have been resolved through talk therapy rather than pills and their doctor just threw the pills at them and wondered why it didn't fix anything.   I feel like in a lot of ways we as a society haven't destigmatized mental illness or personal struggle so much as we've merely pathologized it, so the method that doesn't require a lot of bedside manner, effort, or personal investment on the physician's side has taken precedence.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The problem with modern psychiatry, (with the exception of a lot of cutting edge science focused on holistic healing methods) is that they are overly focused on symptomology and treating that, rather than providing cures. It's like if you had cancer and the doctor only prescribed pain medication without chemotherapy.  So, an illustration of curing a mental illness would be more like giving an unmotivated depressed person aderol and SSRIs to get them interacting with the world again AND treating the symptom of their debilitating sadness. This isn't a cure all for depression, but when psychiatrists start to focus on treating the patients needs and unfufilled desires in life then they can cure the root of mental illness, which is caused by needing to cope with the shittier parts of life, :(.  Things are changing for the better though, :)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"My experience was so similar to yours. Over the course of ages 10-16 I was diagnosed with: OCD (this was first- age 10, immediately prescribed Prozac) Depression General Anxiety Disorder Aspergers Syndrome (not a mental disorder that requires pills. considered a developmental disorder- a form of high-functioning autism. Sincerely don't actually think I have that one either. BUT as a side note I experienced what it feels like to at least think i had something so stigmatized and to all those with autism that stigma is so unfortunate and I do wish for its end) Mood Disorder NOS and finally Adjustment Disorder (This one is more valid! they didn't try and pill me up for it lol, just said I had a hard time coping with some of the events in my life)  I decided to refuse pills after having been put on: -prozac -zoloft -wellbutrin -lamictal -buspiron (I feel like I'm forgetting one too) all to no avail.     pills didn't work, most therapists didn't either (dear god the amount of overpriced 'reflective listening'). at almost 17 I was lucky enough to stumble across an actually beneficial therapist for me. I saw her weekly for probably 3-4 months and then decided I didn't need to see her any more.       Am I cured? I mean i don't know what healthy-brained even means any more tbh, and i think the boundaries on what is considered a disorder have definitely been pushed a little bit beyond reality. But I'm not actively suffering and with the support of the therapist was able to get to the point of understanding my brain well enough to identify actual root causes and address a lot of the problems I was having myself.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The Foucauldian Ian Hacking's work for example is fascinating, talking about the socially constructed recursive linguistic/conceptual stuff behind diagnostic categories and other kinds of psychological knowledge. It's not quite antipsychiatry but there's some consonance I suppose.  URL  I'm a training therapist and Psych doc student interested in 'critical psychology' that uses philosophy and critical theory to take a look at psychology/psychiatry.

"Psychiatry, as it currently stands, is based more on politics than it is on science.  In fact, it's probably been like that for decades.  Schizophrenia, for example, only has the current stigma attached to it (the one of violent, inhuman behavior) because of racist underpinning during the Civil Rights Movement, where black protesters were diagnosed as schizophrenic to discredit their beliefs and fear-monger about their actions.  Women have a harder time receiving treatment, even when it would be useful, because they are seen as inherently 'more moody' or what-have-you, and black children receive far 'harsher' diagnoses than white children, again, because of institutional racism and stigma.  And I think, so long as we continue to view psychiatry as a purely scientific field, thus controlled by purely scientific individuals who strive for objectivity out of the goodness of their hearts, instead of as a deeply flawed system that often harms the very people it claims to want to 'cure', mentally ill people will continue to be abused by the psychiatric system - which is something that happens very frequently.  Alarmingly frequently.  It has happened to me and many of my closest friends who are in a similar boat.  But it's hard for mentally ill people to be taken seriously about our own mistreatment.  We are, inherently, 'out of our minds'.  We are paranoid, we seek to victimize ourselves, we are hypersensitive, we are delusional.  So when we say 'My doctor is hurting me', that's just another sign that we need MORE doctors.  When I was put on Seroquel - an anti psychotic with horrible side effects - for my schizoaffective, I continuously begged to be taken off of it because it made me so miserable.  I was told, every time, that I just didn't realize I was sick and needed the meds, so that was a sign I definitely shouldn't be taken off the meds yet.  I was eventually taken off of it because I flunked two classes and gained about 80 pounds and nearly killed myself, but it was really only at that point did anyone believe me about it doing more harm than good.  And I guess I can't blame them, because I was psychotic at the time, and you don't trust psychotic people to know what's best for them.  Just kidding. I can blame them, and I do. Us psychos really hold a grudge!  This comment ended up way longer than intended.  I'm really passionate about this, if you can't tell!

"Literally experienced the same thing last year. I had poor grades and because that made me really unhappy, my parents thought was depressed. The grades got worse because I couldn't deal with the stress and before long, my parents put me in front of a psychiatrist for depression/anxiety or whatever. I was soon being probed upon all sorts of stuff and suggested anti-depressants very strongly. But I knew I wasn't depressed, just down because I wasn't doing well in school.   After the year ended I was so relieved. Nearly all the 'symptoms' I had went away. I'm really glad I fought off the continued call to start anti depressants. I respect that psychiatrist, and doubt she is part of some broad scheme to boost pharmaceutical use, but I have to question how quick she was to suggest medication. The state of psychiatry is for sure super troubling. Contra is right, if you  know the right words, you can get most anything.

"Kind of the inverse experience for me: developed increasingly severe depression starting age 11, age 14 or 15 my parents finally went to a professional who diagnosed me with MDD and GAD without even seeing me, didn't medicate me but did CBT which basically did fuckall for me. Shit got worse, I lost my ability to do stuff, eventually got sent to a psychiatrist who prescribed me an antidepressant and referred me to another guy who diagnosed me with Asperger's (this was right before DSM-V came out and Asperger's wasn't under the umbrella of ASD). I had this really split and conflicting feelings about the whole thing. One one hand the diagnosis validated all the self-loathing thoughts I had about myself being a broken and unworthy human bean, but on the other hand I thought that maybe having an official-looking sheet of paper would maybe get me the help I need? Spoiler Alert: I did not get the help I needed until much later, partly because the whole self-loathing ableist parts of me blocked me from properly advocating for myself as an autistic person who needs help.

"Hey I take quetiapine (Seroquel)! Yaaay! Now on a serious note, me and my family basically ignored the signs that there was something slightly off about myself, until I had a nervous breakdown in 2010. I was misdiagnosed with depression and medicated with Paxil (paroxetine, which I mixed with weed) for a year. Then, I had a manic episode and a psychotic break, and I ended up in the looney bin for 2 months. I actually have borderline personality disorder, and tbh getting the right medication (Seroquel and Depakote) saved my life. That doesn't mean I'm 100% behind psychiatry, for it is a business just like anything else, and since I don't live in the USA it's not so prevalent (Buenos Aires is more of a neurotic city where everyone goes to a Freudian psychologist; only younger people like you and me are increasingly medicated). The experiences I had 6-7 years ago have molded me into an outspoken person about mental health, about accepting help when you need and also about being tolerant to people with problems.

"Medicine, including psychiatry, is an art, not a science.  There is medical science, but that is not what doctors practice.  They take the science that others pursue and try to apply it to real world situations where they can't use the scientific method effectively because the patient is always a data set with one member.  Psychiatrists, as you note, are further limited because they often are relying on the self-reports of patients who may not have a broad understanding of mental conditions to liken own experiences to.  The psychiatrists (and doctors generally) rarely survey they medical literature on drugs being prescribed, as if to try to independently verify their effectiveness.  (Which is why I am always skeptical of movements to make the FDA review of drugs less rigorous to get new drugs approved faster, although I get that people with serious illnesses can find it maddening that a drug they feel they need will be delayed for many years by government 'red tape,' so there are two sides to the issue).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I suppose a corollary to asking 'what is a medical condition?' is asking 'what is a normal human emotion?' If the proposition is that only medical conditions require medication (a simplification of your argument, I know, but I don't feel a misrepresentation) then surely there needs be a discussion regarding the SELF-medication of what is 'merely' a normal human emotion with alcohol and street drugs. I don't really feel as though I can come up with an answer to this (moralistic or otherwise) but it does seem as though it's inherent within your view on psychiatry.   P.S.

"I can't speak for the American psychiatry, but only for the German. Over here, psychiatry has become increasingly cautious determining a diagnosis when people are still children, teenager or young adults. A vital factor is always the experienced loss of quality of life that the patient experiences. In my experience, some psychiatrists are quick to ask patients if they want to try out medication, especially if they suffer from a loss of functionality in their daily life. However, they also always stress the importance of psychotherapy, which has proven to be more effective than medication especially in the long run (except for schizophrenia, which is something entirely different). Patients are always encouraged to connect with a psychotherapist even before they leave the clinic so they have someone to support them professionally as soon as they get back to their daily routines outside. Luckily, nobody needs to pay for therapy themselves here, which is a huge plus. Overall, I am wary of medication myself because it equals firing a cannon at a tiny bird flying in the sky - you can be lucky and it helps you fine, or it can be the start of a year long struggle to find the right medication, only that it turns out that every drug gives you unbearable side effects.  Psychotherapy should always come first, if possible.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hey ContraPoints, great video!  Of course, as a future psychiatrist I have a couple of disagreements but overall I think your analysis is spot on.  ;-)  1.) It's true that the evidence shows SSRIs aren't all that effective in mild to moderate depression, but they do appear to work well for those with major depression and generalized anxiety disorder.  2.) Many of the younger/newer psychiatrists are choosing to medicate less and use psychotherapy (including alternative methods such as mindfulness practice) more often than the previous generation, so hopefully this pattern of over-medication fades out.  3.)  You said: 'The decision to treat a pattern of thoughts and emotions as a disease can never be a fully scientific one.'  I would argue that it can be scientific if a biological basis (e.g. altered brain structure, or some other underlying physiological process driving those thoughts) can be identified in the condition.  That said, that's probably the minority of patients.  P.S. I meant it when I said you'd be legit good at ASMR.  I'll love you forever and ever if you make an ASMR video!

"I was a mental health advocate for involuntary patients seeking release from mental health facilities, in Canada, for a summer.  It was an eye opening experience to the pharmaceutical world. In particular, I recall one client, brought into the facility because of drug induced psychosis.  She had been later diagnosed with severe ADHD after her drug induced psychosis symptoms were gone, likely because she still wanted to go back to work as an escort and her psychiatrist wanted to protect her.  So she was served an involuntary cocktail of amphetamines by injection and held for observation.... really surprised the board decided not to release her. I showed how the DSM forbids attention deficit diagnoses in patients already diagnosed with  psychosis NOS without a prior diagnosis or evidence of prior symptoms.  Turns out a school of psychiatrists exist that believe homeless people should be given ADD meds to cure addition to other substances, and homelessness in general.

"A big problem with psychiatry/psychology is that a very large portion of psychiatrists/psychologists are really, really, really, really bad. Like, the underlying science is completely sound and good, but the practitioners are often extremely dumb and wrong about many important things.  I think this is largely due to the fact that they misinterpret psychiatry as being similar to other forms of medicine, where treatments usually directly target the condition/symptoms in question and we more or less understand how they work. But in the case of psychiatry, psychiatric conditions are often very vaguely defined and are likely caused by a large variety of different things. Take 'Depression' for example. Chances are there isn't just one specific medical illness that causes 'Depression.' Depression is just a collection of symptoms that can likely be caused by a variety of different underlying conditions (that we unfortunately can't really examine since we can't cut open peoples' brains).   But a lot of psychiatrists don't understand everything I just mentioned above. They come up with their own stupid ideas based upon their personal experiences (like 'SSRI X is better for 'energy' than SSRI Y' - a literal thing I've heard). As an educated person who works in a field vaguely related to academia (a programmer for a web tool used by biologists, so I work with a bunch of geneticists and what have you), I genuinely think that I know more than a very large number of psychiatrists. This isn't so much because I'm smart or anything, but because a lot of psychiatrists do not continue to learn about the field (which obviously frequently changes) and also have pretty questionable abilities to think scientifically and understand scientific literature (which is a problem common among MDs as well). Ironically, the best psychiatrist I ever had was this young guy in the middle of his residency who I saw during college. He was the only one who seemed to understand the uncertain nature of the medications prescribed and the fact that psychiatry is largely a matter of just trial and error.  As a general rule, if you go to a psychiatry, get prescribed with Depression, and are then prescribed a newer, brand-name (non-generic) SSRI, you should change doctors. Many psychiatrists just believe the drug reps who come and tell them 'this SSRI is totally awesome and better than earlier ones' and then pass on that bad knowledge to their patients.  So I guess to sum up, as I said at the beginning the science of psychiatry is mostly good (or at least not any worse than any other medical science), but it has some serious problems with bad practitioners.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Have you read Mad in America or looked into the Mad Pride movement?  In my case I think of some of my mental illnesses as diseases (the intrusive suicidal ideation and self-harm images get... rough), some as the reaction any reasonable person would have to severe chronic pain and stuck with a significantly disabled body, while others (ADHD and ASD, specifically, and somewhat anxiety) are just my brain behaving in a different way from normal society and it adds valuable diversity and robustness to Humanity as a whole.  And honestly, this is why I'm in favor of self-diagnosis. Doctors are notoriously bad at telling whether someone is 'mad' or 'sane' (whatever those may be) even in a hospital setting, let alone figuring out exactly what's wrong (my ADHD was misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder), and don't even get me started on how many psychiatrists don't recognize ASD unless it's in a young, white, male patient.   If it's a handy matrix to understand how you interact with the world, whatever. Like everything it can be mishandled, and education helps guard against that, but I don't care enough about gatekeeping to really give a shit. *shrug*  Most of my friends figure out well before going to their doctor that they have anxiety or depression, and then they look online for coping habits and remedies as they wait for eons on the bureaucratic wheels of the healthcare field of finally get them in front of a doctor.  But we should also accept those who are mentally ill who reject the psychiatric industry wholesale, and pay particular attention to those who have been abused by it and are ringing the warning bells about forced medication (I had a friend with epilepsy who was 'not-technically-forced' to do ECT for her depression, otherwise she would've been taken from living independently in the community and forced into a group home 'for her own good').","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I wouldn't eat or sleep because of it, my heard rate would go up and after it wore off I felt absolutely horrible. Because it was so normal for me to take those meds it never occurred to me that the pills could be the issue. In meanwhile, people at school and family members thought I was just going through puberty (I have to admit, I was never completely honest about how bad it was).

"The fact that individuals can react to drugs in very different ways makes psychiatric medicine such a complex issue. It took me several different attempts to get a medication that worked, and then I needed more because the pill that worked for my depression also turned me super aggressive as a side effect. That, luckily, could be alleviated with another medication. So for a couple of years, the best way to describe my medication was 'a pill every morning to prevent me from killing myself and a second pill to prevent me from killing someone else.'  I've since dropped both pills in favor of taking nothing, because I'm not a useless blithering mess wallowing in self-pity anymore, though my condition has not completely left me alone and probably never will. At the very least, I'm now mostly functional.  Another positive I got from getting medical help to my depression was that it lead me to a psychiatrist who recognized that some of my issues stem from childhood trauma.

"Personally, I see my depression and anxiety as a symptom of trying to be 'normal' and where yes, some medicines can help me level out my emotional stability. But then everything else, everything 'not normal' about me that I've long seen as something being wrong with me I now see as me being very emotionally sensitive, coupled with a ... let's say slightly higher than average intellectual and emotional intelligence.   Which is to say that yes I am 'sick' with depression due to people throughout my life telling me that what I am feeling is wrong, and that I am weird, making me doubt my feelings and myself as a person. But my 'weirdness' and sensitivity itself is not a sickness, it is just out of the norm... and my goal in life -I guess- is to make my 'softness' my strength.

"Part of the problem is a phenomenon called 'scapegoat diagnosis.' Scapegoat diagnosis is something I myself have experience with, almost as the inverse to your experience, funnily enough. Scapegoat diagnosis is when you have a mental illness or other neurodiversity that's more complex or 'difficult' than your professional wants to deal with- such as bpd or schizophrenia spectrum disorder- so they diagnose you with something 'simpler' like anxiety or depression, ignoring your other symptoms for convenience's sake. This is especially damaging when you have both.  For a good few years, I was treated for generalized anxiety disorder by a Freudian charlatan who did far more harm than good, pathologising my grey-ace sexuality and my emerging gender identity as something to do with parental problems. When I finally saw a real professional it took over half a year for them to acknowledge that most of my symptoms- hallucinations, delusions, obsessions and compulsions, instability in relationships and attachments- were far outside of the GAD diagnosis. It's also been a horrendous struggle getting my parents to acknowledge each new diagnosis, due to their (largely valid) skepticism regarding the amount of diagnosis I have, and they don't even know about half of the things I've discussed with my psychiatrist+psychologist. So far, I've been diagnosed with PTSD, C-PTSD, moral injury (debated whether it's a type of PTSD or just a facet of standard PTSD), OCD, double depression and psychosis+personality disorder traits, and I've been advised to screen myself for autism, ADD and dyspraxia.  Psychiatry as a profession fucking sucks, to be blunt. Its founder was a pseudoscientist and it's only started seeing something resembling real scientific rigour in very recent years- and even much of that is still very questionable.   Giving a teenager a dangerous, hardcore bipolar drug (lithium carbonate) to treat dysthymia is a shit idea. But they did that anyway, after misdiagnosing me with cyclothymia. Luckily I ended up being taken off those pills after the nausea started.  My treatment began in New Zealand- a country with a notoriously shitty medical system, lagging decades behind in many areas, and where I was living at the time- and unfortunately was cut short after I returned to England. However, I should be starting again soon, and I'm very grateful. I've seen real improvements and I only wish I'd spoken up about my symptoms sooner. I just hope they don't try to put me through hell for my autism, god knows they handle that in a borderline eugenicist manner a lot of the time... In fact, the ignorance of doctors towards neurodiversity is the scariest thing for me. Autism should never be treated as something to be 'cured'. Doing so puts autistic people through hell and causes untold suffering through quackery like ABA. I need to be validated by the medical system though, in order to recieve the help I need in the educational system.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Skimming the comments, I must be lucky as all balls, because I've never had a doctor try to enforce some imaginary standard of normalcy on me (and I have two chronic conditions that necessitate a raft of specialists each)... they ask, 'What's the problem?' and if there's something that I don't want to fix, they don't press the issue. In particular, my psychologist helped me with a gaming addiction, but first he asked, you know, if you want to do this for a living, make a career of it, you can do that. I didn't, 'cuz I wanted to be an artist, so he helped me accomplish that. (Which meant giving up video-games cold turkey), but we both tried our level best to work out a solution without giving them up for the longest time, 'til I realized it was gonna be one or the other, so I made my decision and he helped me see it through). Course, the difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist is that the former will help you fix your problems, while the latter can proscribe you something... when all you have is a hammer, the whole world looks like a nail.

"My perspective? I barely scraped through high school. All my teachers said pretty much the same thing: Smart kid, doesn't do his homework. Disorganized, absent minded. But, I'd sit quietly in class with my nose in a library book, and wasn't one of those kids who was constantly bouncing off the walls. Wasn't until I bombed out of college (exact same thing happened; did well in class, didn't get assignments done) that I saw a psychologist (about an unrelated issue), and he got me what I really needed: ritalin (turns out, I had ADD, which is more typical in girls than boys, who usually have ADHD, so no one even suspected it cuz I wasn't bouncing off the walls). I'd spent years blaming myself for inadequacy... I was smart, I understood what was being taught in class, I just never seemed to test well.   Here's the thing: if you don't need ritalin, or antidepressants, or what have you, taking them is a very bad idea. The people who do need them? Cannot get by without. There is no substitute. It's not a matter of behavioural problems, or bad parenting. You can't discipline away a medical problem... well, not most of 'em, at least. If there's a real solution, I'd say that parents (and doctors) need to be properly informed, to know what to look for, and to pay attention to their children, actually listen to them, and make sure the treatment they get is working as it should. I think most parents just want a magic bullet pill that will fix everything and make all the problems go away, but human beings just aren't that straightforward... especially children.  I don't think people in general really understand mental problems... physical problems, yeah: it's understood that, as a diabetic, I can't just decide to get by without insulin. Mental issues? Everyone thinks it all comes down to mind over matter. If you're dumb, you need to smarten up... if you're prone to deviant behaviour, you need to straighten yourself out. If you're emotional, you just need to chill out. Like you can just change your mind like you change your clothes.

"Hi! I like a lot of your videos, but I think this was not one of your strongest videos. The reason for that is because I feel like this video fundamentally is about two different points. The first point you seemed to be talking about was the definition of 'disease,' and how social perceptions affect ideas of 'wellness.' The second point you were trying to make seemed to be about a perverse incentive that might exist among psychiatrists to over proscribe certain medications, for economic reasons. There is research into this issue of perverse incentives, and I think a fairly accessible point was made in a series by the Freakanomics podcast about the healthcare field (The last part of which, most focused on this issue of prescriptions, can be found here; URL  While I think I understand why you wanted to include those two points together, namely to say that some sort of perverse incentives or profit motive may impact the way people try to define 'disease' in society, I kinda think that somewhere in between the tentacles those points got lost.  Lastly, I think that part of it was that you put this whole video through the lens of your personal experience. As a fan I'm actually really happy to have some sort of insight into who you are because of it, but from the perspective of the points in the video, it was like a whole third element being put on top of those two other elements I talked about. It was a lot of stuff.  I think this video would have been better had it been a more compartmentalized video, similar to your Baltimore or White Nationalism videos, or even split it into multiple videos.  Thanks, and overall good work on your videos!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"You pretty much said what I have been trying to say about the psychiatric industry for years. I've had a very similar experience to you, contrapoints. It makes me sad though how people seem to defend it because they think it helps them. It's really selfish of them, how they overlook all these issues that other people have, and how the drugs in general may not even be a good solution for a lot of people or themselves. I certainly felt that way myself, and I remember growing up having a perfectly normal state of mind, but through years of being put on those drugs from a young age, of which I stopped years ago none the less, I still feel as though it's left my mind more unstable in the long run. That latter most conjecture seems to be consistent with articles I have been reading on scientific America, although what I'm feeling needs to be accounted for somehow, regardless of the legitimacy of that publication.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hi, I'm a semester away from a bachelor's in Psychology (and maybe a year away from one in Neuroscience if I wanted it) so I just wanted to add some of what I've learned in school.  When we talk about mental disorders, they're usually only classified or described in the DSM if they're considered 'maladaptive'.  In essence, only if they're of a significant detriment to the person's life where they're either suffering because of it or are missing what most people would consider important human qualities (ie: a person with antisocial disorder isn't personally bothered by their brain, typically, but understands they're missing something we consider important)  With that in mind, I do agree that all your drugs and therapies were probably unnecessary.  At least with the way you phrased your story, it sounded like your parents saw you do something strange and asked a professional about it before asking you.  So your therapies may have never been *for* you, but for your parents.  That isn't to say no one had your well-being in mind, it's just that it's not very common for parents to let children take responsibility for what they're doing or what they want to be. (if that makes sense?  sometimes i no good words)  Anyway, it seems like (from my point of view) that your diagnoses were a little rushed (with OCD they usually do not diagnose without the compulsion to do the repetitive actions; you'd need an excuse like 'I will die if I don't spend hours in the bathroom' or whatever), especially because at least *I* was taught that people going into psychology should keep in mind that a diagnosis may harm the patient more than help.  In your case it was medicine you probably didn't need.  In other cases, people will think they're somehow sub-human because their brain isn't working in a 'correct' way.  I don't think I have to explain why that'd hurt some one with Depression or anxiety.  The other thing I wanted to contribute was that I agree with how we shouldn't medicate certain ways of behavior or thought.  As I said, we try not to do it unless it's maladaptive.  In the current DSM, there is no treatment suggestions for Gender Dysphoria (talking about why that's in there is a slippery slope already), and there's an arousal disorder described as happening when ONLY A WOMAN isn't interested in sex or has no sense of sexual attraction or whatever.  That entry is appended with 'don't make a diagnosis if the person identifies as asexual'.  In it's core, all these diagnoses and garbage are meant to help people get over things that may cause them discomfort or invisible pain or keep them from living a life without fear or whatever, but obviously there's still a lot of work to be done, and a lotta shitty people that shouldn't be contributing.  Sorry this was so long, thank you for reading!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I really wonder why so many patients with ADD are started off on adderall.  I can't stand this whole group of drugs- stimulants.  And it seems almost cruel to give them to children.  I take Strattera as an adult, and it's great.  It's a cousin of prosaic, so it's basically an anti-depressant.  Helps me with my anxiety and ADD (did you know most people who have ADD also have anxiety?).  But yeah, another great video.  I think when our only way to manage emotions is with this difficult industry, we've lost before we've begun.  Ultimately I wish that we could normalize talk and behavioral therapy as a way of navigating out lives, like message therapists or something.  It's a tough conversations because the resistance to acknowledging the existence of mental illness by a large population means that the rest of us sort of feel compelled to just support medical treatment for everything all the time unquestioningly.  Ultimately I think it's a personal decision.  If it's improving your life, fuck it, I'm in no place to judge.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It touches on a number of these ideas and shares similar conclusions, though skepticism toward medicalizing others' inconvenient behavior is probably very old and with a robust literature that you have on the shelf behind you.   I am one of those whose life was saved by psychiatry, though in adulthood after making the terrible mistake of going to grad school for a Ph.D. in the humanities, where rates of depression and suicide are very high. In the span of about a year I went from planning my own suicide to completing my dissertation and getting the hell out of that lunatic profession. I didn't get any drugs, though, just cognitive behavioral therapy that communicated ways of thinking that continue to help me years later in my calmer, blander 30s.  My experience is of course anecdotal, but I found it useful and a very useful education to see a psychiatrist. It was a little like having a philosopher on retainer who was paid to be interested in my problems.

"Also, as someone who did have their life saved by psychiatry, I definitely understand the skepticism people have toward psychiatric drugs, and, as someone with a bachelor's in psychology and has taken a peek behind the curtain into the finer points of how these drugs affect the mind, I can safely say that being prescribed to any of these is kind of a dice roll in that, while psychiatrists have a general idea of what they'll do, they have no idea as to how intensely the drugs will affect people or which of the various side-effects would occur, which is why treatment with psychiatric drugs is commonly coupled with regular therapy to monitor how the drugs are affecting people.

"I have had almost the opposite experience.  I had debilitating depression and my parents solution was to have me pray and said it was just a teenage thing that I'd grow out of.  I was also seeing endless neurologists each with more merit than the last until I was in a new, experimental study in Boston.  It was about 25 years of, 'we don't know, run more tests' No diagnosis or anything.  Eventually I ran off with my wife to live where I am now.  After prodding I went to a psychiatrist.  He told me that other doctor's would say I'm Autistic but that diagnosis was meaningless.  I had incredible results from Prozac and Webextrin (sp)?

"I guess I was lucky in as much as my parents didn't like the first psychologist they sent me to when I was eight. After about four sessions the psychologist told my parents I was sexually abused despite having no recollection of any such activity occurring, even after all these years. So you can see shit gets weird with some psychologists throw out a diagnosis like depression which was true but as for the cause it was clear they didn't nor did I know the actual cause until decades later (thanks gender dysphoria).   But what scares me the most is that the pendulum is swinging the other way where any diagnosis is treated as a joke even when treatments are actually working like with myself and my sister (she's classic bipolar and lithium has worked IMO she's far more even in her reactions to things than I remember through the years). So I have to wonder who's to blame?

"It's an unpopular opinion but I think that a lot of depression and anxiety are often products of capitalist society. I'm not saying it's never anything else, and I'm certainly not saying it's invalid or not real. But considering that depression and anxiety increase as socioeconomic status decreases and the fact that a lot of people end up committing suicide due to financial strain and an inability to see a way out of a situation where we're working during all daylight hours and have no time to be social. That's only one example and there are countless more, not the least of which includes advertisements whose entire purpose is to make you feel shitty about yourself to sell products. Looking back at my own history I can say that these are the case for me, at least.  I don't know. I don't trust DSM culture nor pharmaceutical companies and I think it's counterproductive to declare anxiety and depression something innate when the science behind it is both new and compromised by financial interests (and also it's fucking stupid to tell a kid who gets bullied for years that they were born socially anxious, for example). I think we'd see significantly less depression and anxiety, and/or much less destructive cases of it, in a society where survival and community are a given and people could instead just work on making life actually cool. And it's frustrating that I'll probably be interpreted as wanting to erase the reality of mental illness because of that, but I get it. I'm not here for the 'get over it, it's all in your head, suck it up and go be a productive member of society' garbage either, that's also puritanical capitalist nonsense. I think while we're stuck here-- if an antidepressant helps you cope with our current hellscape better, that's awesome, you do you.

"ContraPoints, you usually make great videos, but I have to disagree strongly with some of the conclusions that you've made here.  I'll focus mainly on the ADHD aspect, because I've spent my entire life struggling with this condition.  Adderall is certainly in the same class of chemicals as methamphetamine, but comparing Adderall to crystal meth is like comparing Advil to Fentanyl or a cup of coffee to cocaine.  Moreover, Adderall and Ritalin (which is in a different class of chemicals altogether) are both known to improve symptoms in children with ADHD.  These chemicals affect the brains of people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.  When a person with ADHD takes these drugs, they don't feel like they're cranked up, as would be the experience of a neurotypical taking these drugs, but instead they just feel normal, like they can get through the day while actually being able to think clearly.  Sure, some of the studies that have shown their effectiveness over the last four decades have been industry-funded, but plenty have been funded by non-profit organizations and governments.    Your second error, and in my opinion the more serious one, is that you write off ADHD as merely a 'pattern of disordered thought or emotion' brought about only by 'children being bored' or due to emotional incompatibilities with the school system.  This is a major misunderstanding of the life experience of a person with this condition: many people with ADHD struggle in school despite actually wanting to do well, and in fact many of them are intellectually gifted and would be exceptional students were it not for their condition.  Perhaps it would be better to think of these not as 'bad students' but as students whose 'badness' happens to be treatable, and furthermore I feel like these students deserve the right to treat the condition that causes those academic weaknesses.  In my opinion it is just wrong to say that we should just tell these students that they need to give up their ambitions and not help them to seek treatment because we've decided that some people, by virtue of the accident of birth, get to have the privilege of having a brain that is capable of helping them realize their ambitions, and some don't.  I mean, even digressing from the issue of mental health for a second, don't people have a right to have the brain that they want to have?    Another objection I have to raise is against the implication that ADHD is only something that affects school performance.  It's not.  ADHD, especially when untreated, is associated with a higher mortality risk that lasts throughout the lifetime.  Yes, there is much to be said about the extent to which society overemphasizes arbitrary indicators of intelligence and the pressure that the education system puts on young people to center their whole lives on earning a high enough number so that they can get into another school and spend another four years doing it all over again, but I doubt that this will be any comfort to a teenager with untreated ADHD who's just landed in the ICU because he couldn't prevent his attention from lapsing while he was driving, or to a person who struggles to make friends because their inability to focus means they can't hold conversations.  Untreated ADHD is also a risk factor for depression, substance abuse, anxiety, and self-harm.  And I don't think that I should have to tell you that it has a neurological basis.  Over-diagnosis is also not an issue with ADHD, in fact, it's the other way around.  The majority of ADHD cases will not be diagnosed or treated, generally due to issues of economic class and gender.  Economic class because many poor people lack access to mental health services, and gender because ADHD is stereotypically seen as a 'boy's disease'. And on top of this, many people who demonstrably fit the profile don't seek treatment because they think that they're 'just lazy' or 'just stupid' or 'just not cut out for school', and dismissing the reality that ADHD is a disorder or minimizing the impact it has on people is doing a disservice to these individuals.  I'm sorry if my tone here came across as harsh, but I had to get that out there.  While I understand that you don't hold anti-psychiatry views, you should know that many of the points you make here are also some of the common talking points of the anti-psychiatry movement.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I want to start this by declaring my liking to your content. I really espouse your criticism of the Youtube atheist community and the whole anti social justice activism movement. But, this is a serious issue you are touching in the video, that requires expertise. I sympathize with your position; I understand that your lack of expertise in the field, and a personal bad experience have influenced your view about psychiatry, although there are some things that need to be clarified.  Claim 1: 'Most of the research of those drugs is funded by pharmaceutical companies with billions of dollars at stake' There are certain serious issues with Big Pharma, but most of the slander they get is based on conspiracy theories. Appealing to the motive of the scientists that research the subject is counter-productive. Do you really want to discredit valid evidence and arguments based on the author's motives?   Claim 2: 'Many of the most prescribed drugs barely do better than placebos' This is a factually wrong claim based on a handful of controversial (meaning not following standard consensus guidelines) peer reviewed publications that have been refuted. There are various studies showing that the efficacy of SSRIs is way better than placebos. Not to mention that a portion of the placebo effect can be attributed to a statistical regression (see: regression to the mean).  Claim 3: 'Psychiatry medicalizes ordinary human emotions and treats them as desease symptoms' and 'to call them desease is inevitably to pass a value judgement' Those overlap the field of philosophy, to which you are are more familiar than I am.  Classifying something as a desease or illness is simply a descriptive claim not a prescriptive one, therefore it does not pass a value judgement. You are the one making the value judgement, based on the contextual meaning of the word in other instances. The reality is that there are patterns that are really uncomfortable to a person, some of which are as maladaptive as to be considered an illness. I don't want to focus on that point a lot, as you only present it in the context of a cost-benefit analysis (see: below I deal with the side effect scare) and it can be open for debate.  Claim 4: 'Drugs on the market make you suicidal'  The side effects of SSRIs are highly exaggerated. I will only refute the suicide claim here, for practical reasons. The peer-reviewed scientific studies that showed an increase in suicide ideation were fundamentally flawed and have been refuted. The media and anti-psychiatry activists inflate those claims resulting in misconceptions. In fact there are clear scientific studies that show the opposite.  In reality, the manufactured scare resulted in a decreased drug prescription rate followed by a correlated increased suicide rate. (Reference PMID: PMC2799109)  As a closure I want to quote the statement of the American Psychiatric Association:  'Research has shown that serious neurobiological disorders such as schizophrenia reveal reproducible abnormalities of brain structure (such as ventricular enlargement) and function. Compelling evidence exists that disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism to name a few have a strong genetic component. Still, brain science has not advanced to the point where scientists or clinicians can point to readily discernible pathologic lesions or genetic abnormalities that in and of themselves serve as reliable or predictive biomarkers of a given mental disorder or mental disorders as a group. Ultimately, no gross anatomical lesion such as a tumor may ever be found; rather, mental disorders will likely be proven to represent disorders of intercellular communication; or of disrupted neural circuitry. Research already has elucidated some of the mechanisms of action of medications that are effective for depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, attention deficit, and cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. These medications clearly exert influence on specific neurotransmitters, naturally occurring brain chemicals that effect, or regulate, communication between neurons in regions of the brain that control mood, complex reasoning, anxiety, and cognition. In 1970, The Nobel Prize was awarded to Julius Axelrod, Ph.D., of the National Institute of Mental Health, for his discovery of how anti-depressant medications regulate the availability of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine in the synapses, or gaps, between nerve cells.'   Even though you do issue a disclaimer I still think that this video is irresponsible and helps stigmatize mental patients and the field of psychiatry; you haven't researched the subject and only presented an one sided (your experience) view. I am not trying to sugar coat the field of psychiatry because there are some issues with overdiagnosis. Usually though, those issues, when presented outside the field of expertise result in misconceptions that can negatively affect human lives.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I was diagnosed with depression last year, and given medication for it around July. I believe I was rightfully diagnosed and the medicine does help me, but I am looking to get off of it some time in the near future (because I believe my unhealthy diet + lack of physical activity is the primary cause) I may still need the medication after becoming physically healthier. but I'll never really know without trying, ya know? But, anyways, 8 years old is definitely too young to diagnose a child (especially a boy) with ADD (or most mental illnesses, probably). Also, all of scenarios sound to me like your parents weren't able to deal with your personality and emotions, so they wrote you off as ill instead.

"A thing I noticed with descriptions people gave of all sort of health problems they have had is that in some cases doctors have to sort of guess what the problem is until they stumble upon the right diagnosis, if they find out what exactly the problem is at all. My mother had back pains for a while and couldn't figure out what it was. After three doctors had prescribed different ways to deal with it, all with little effect, a fourth doctor, who happened to have a stronger background in the relevant medical field, managed to find out within minutes that the issue was probably a nerve in the upper spine. This was quickly confirmed and more appropriate treatment and accurate predictions of what would happen soon followed. Other people I know have had toilet problems for years until they found out what it was that they had kept eating that they were allergic for. Doctors aren't omniscient either and many people are misdiagnosed or under or overdiagnosed because of this. Apparently making the right diagnosis is just hard and sometimes due to bad luck our doctors don't know how to solve our problems or what our problems even are.   Besides that, the ease with which you apparently get medicated in America is a little concerning.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There's certainly a lot of wrong with psychiatry and psychology, just like with any thing. My country provides free health care, but there's an opinion going around that free psychological help is bs and you have to go to a private doctor whom you pay yourself to get better. When I first tried to get some help for the debilitating despair I was experiencing and I went to a psychologist, it was terrible. There was no dialogue, she just sat there and waited for me to say something, she even looked bored at points. After only a few visits, which were really stressful for me, I dropped trying to get help altogether and I became convinced that I couldn't get help. I became sad and suicidal for over a year (was just sad before). Recently I finally decided to get some help again, but tried a psychiatrist this time, because, as it turns out, it's even easier to get a free appointment with those. I got some drugs, a more competent psychologist and I feel fine.

"My oldest son was quasi-diagnosed with ADHD, and then and now, this just seemed like the dx du jour and bullshit. But later on a reasonable psychologist made the asperger's diagnosis and that had a clear basis in reality. I refused any psych meds though- there is no real understanding of the long term affects of these kinds of mind-altering substances used on developing brains. I have been in and out of a lot of nursing homes and long term care facilities, and if you ever meet a person who has been taking hard core drugs for a long time.....its pretty fucking awful. And in my son's case, I am very sympathetic to the idea of someone just not being 'neurotypical', and that may not always be a bad thing. Its not like neurotypical human behavior is so endlessly fabulous.  For me, I likely would not be alive today without psychology. My 'major depressive disorder recurrent with obsessional tendencies' was like a little gremlin living in my head talking about the beauty of death and the ugliness of me, and sometimes the little fucker sounds pretty reasonable. The zoloft takes enough of the edge off that I can deal with it. I've been on other stuff which helped but had too many side effects.  To me a lot of it revolves around what is really affecting you and your life, and what trade-offs you are willing to make to deal with it. This isn't actually so far off from other health issues. If you have cancer or heart disease or a bone problem or whatever, there are usually a range of options open to you and you have to decide what you will or won't do. And drug companies would like you to just be non-stop medicated, but you gotta do what is right for you.

"I think this variation on humanity as it has existed here on Spaceship:Earth has got a severely flawed, dangerous, and completely slavishly pathetic understanding of emotions. That they are referred to as emotion's', as in plural, while the 'intellect' enjoys a unified conception is telling. The thinking seems to be that emotions that effect the output of a human should be policed and emotions that don't are but sleeping dogs that should not be disturbed. The ability to swallow up and un-identify with our emotions was and is considered a strength, such as when Tony Soprano bemoaned the fading glory of such types as Gary Cooper, 'The Strong Silent Type'. Just at the point when true psychological understanding and ownership stood its most potential possibility for freedom, after the likes of Freud, Jung, and my personal fave, Erich Fromm, the disease industry ( something I consider akin to a policing agency) has given us the ability to avoid ourselves to the very end, by drugging us in such a way that we aren't so much as healed or fixed, but rather nullified by something that strips our identity away. It's awful. I consider myself a cynical optimist, Critical but frankly, happier than most, I think. I have rage in my soul and a very deep capacity to love. How much would i have any of that had I accepted the answer my Psychologists and Psychiatrists prescribed: that the best means for coping with barely punishable parental mental and physical abuse was a 150mg of thorazine and 4mg of Stelazine a day? That's what they gave me. I quit them after a year, and instead learned fashionably acceptable forms of manipulation to end the abuse and get as far from home as possible. The rest was self exploration and a refusal to accept easy answers or even answers at all. The entire disease industry runs on the notion that you will do anything to have an answer, something to believe, so as to stop all that pesky brain thinking. Nietzsche had some words on the subject when he suggested we are stunted by a will to an end. To be able to go through life without having to have something to slavishly BELIEVE, that is true strength. Having said that, fellow philosophers, I should add I'm idealist. Fuck Nietzsche.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"My experience was pretty negative too, though in a different way. In my case, they were too cautious. Firstly, too cautious in diagnosing. They wouldn't diagnose me with a problem I very obviously had, so I couldn't get treatment for it. Psychologists will happily diagnose you with whatever they find interesting or fashionable to treat, but not with what you actually have.   Secondly, they're too cautious in giving transgender people access to medical transition. They've strung me along and lied to me for years, which allowed my body's native puberty to influence my looks more than necessary. This lead to suicide attempts, and in cases of friends of mine it lead to their death. Once I was able to access hormones I became stable because I didn't have to worry about my body developing the wrong way.  True, they are too quick to diagnose normal things as diseased, and they are too quick to medicate, but at the same time they're also too cautious in listening to and trusting in a patient's knowledge of themselves.

Now this is where I come in, slowly over the course of my academic life I began to develop violent mood swings, short periods of euphoria followed by long (weeks, months, even seasons) periods of depression and total draining of energy, so that my body ached all the time, not to mention constant feeling of anxiety with in turn lead to insomnia, and eventually daily anxiety attacks, where my brain would begin to spin like a wheel and sense would overload, and I would be overcome with the sense that everything was irrevocably wrong.  Now all this did not happen at once, and it more or less built up over time, but any time I tried to ask for help from my family I was almost always told something like, 'you should go to bed earlier', or if I brought up my Aunt or Grandfather, my parents would tell never tell anyone about them: 'she has a mental disorder; you don't have that; don't let people think that.'  After seven years of taking the stoic approach, with the belief that I merely needed to buckle down and work harder, and that all of this despair would go away if I merely found a purpose, I reached a point in which I could go no further.  My body had no strength left, I found myself sobbing uncontrollably, and I was experiencing four or five anxiety attacks in a row daily.  My mother, herself brought to tears (she the daughter of my grandfather who had shot himself 50 years ago), finally took my to a psychiatrist. It is two year later, I no longer suffer any of the symptoms of Bipolar disorder, and my Doctor is also slowly reducing my medication.  It is no exaggeration that if I lived in another century I would have no doubt killed myself, and physics of the mind saved my life. This is other extreme, to ignore all the problems of the mind, and I barely survived it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Look, as much as I usually like your videos, speaking as somebody on the autism spectrum who's known quite a few people with mental health issues, this video is irresponsible and disgusting and you should feel goddamn ashamed to put it out.   Like, yeah that 'moody' teenager could just be 'moody,' but the dismissal of mental health problems at that age as just a subjective state of mind not only can lead to letting issues fester that can fuck you up for life and deny young people the language to talk about their problems, but it leads to erasure of the mental health experience and leaves people lost wondering 'Is this all my fault?' I know multiple people who almost died due to that exact sort of dismissal of their mental health issues on the psychosis spectrum at that age, and I know they wouldn't appreciate this garbage in the slightest.  No matter how well intentioned, this rhetoric of over-diagnosis and 'It's all just a state of mind maaaaaaaan' leads to erasure of neuroatypicality and mental health issues, and to gatekeeping of treatment because 'how do you know you aren't lying'. It leads to people being unable to speak about their neurological differences and getting help for them because the language they use is dismissed as being 'lazy' or denying 'responsibility,' the most notable example of which is executive dysfunction. And I am so goddamn sick of this hippie garbage about how we should all just goddamn erase the  neuroatypicality just because some snooty little hellicopter parents got a diagnosis wrong once or couldn't come up with a plan that works for you  I'm sick of the rhetoric of neurodiversity and self-determination being hijacked by neurotypicals like you, who have zero idea of what you're talking about but have only experienced the mental healthcare system as a bourgie luxury than a VITAL NEED as so many of us do, for the purposes of erasure and vague hippie nonsense that leads to gatekeeping, and rhetoric like yours has hurt so many of my friends.

"Psychiatry is a minefield if you do not know what is wrong with you to start with & in the past we have had information buried or overlooked to maintain a certain, moral/social 'order'. During this paradigm, 'dis-orders' were diagnosed a plenty including HPD targeting housewives who as we later found out, were simply bored to death by being only a housewife & told that was all one was good for.  The paradigm is shifting to a more personal basis where a diagnosis is really only offered to people who are psychologically distressed by something (like a behaviour or being a social outcast etc). Some people really do not want to be transgender & have been known to seek psychiatric help to alleviate their dis-ease. If being transgender does not cause dis-ease, then what disease can be treated other than trying to make society less reliant certain arbitrary 'orders' which would cause society to classify one as an outcast which causes dis-ease in & of itself.  If you are not adversely affected from the symptoms of a dis-ease or dis-order, then what is there to treat & how would the outcome benefit the patient? Not to mention, what was the basis for classifying something as a categorical dis-ease or dis-order in the 1st place for the diagnosis/prognosis framework?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It seems like there really isn't any ideal solution, peoples' minds are just too complex and experiences are too subjective for one-size-fits-all solutions and that trial and error over a long period of time is almost inevitable.

"i was also diagnosed ADD in the early 2000s as an elementary schooler. took ritalin it on and off for a while but was more 'off' it by high school. in college i had severe depression and was self harming and making suicide attempts. took two and a half more years of psychiatry and counseling to find a medication that worked for me. psychiatric medicine (at least for things like depression) seem to be a big game of guess and check until you happen upon something that works. to me it seems like the only real way to get decent results from medication is if the individual in question is knowledgeable about the prescriptions they are taking and take a very active self-advocacy role in their treatment. unfortunately most people who need psychiatric care are not really in a position to do that very effectively. i think this is why it seems like there is an over-diagnosis and under-diagnosis problem simultaneously.  i only really recommend going the route of medical psychiatric care for people who have very severe symptoms that are either unbearable or put your own health or the safety of others at risk. years or more of patience and the experience of mild to severe side effects are more or less inevitable, but can be extremely worth it. counseling though is chill and less terrible to get through if you are able to find a good counselor and can afford it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Wow in USA people really are overmedicated. A psychiatrist who diagnosed me with clinical depression did not want to perscribe much medication and insted directed me to therapy, which helped IMMENSLY. Overall I think psychiatry is necessary but like every medical or general science, it needs to evolve and adapt to new evidence. There used to be a time where seizures were treated with exorcisms and executions. Similarly, there were times where homosexuality was treated with lobotomies... that cannot invalidate the entire science, but it is important to recognize the flaws in the science. Still, I can't help but want to just shake my mother and ask what the fuck is wrong with her when she insists there aren't any psychiatric issues with young kids or adults, it's just psychiatrists making up terminology to profit off of people. Funnily enough, she got that idea once I went to therapy that SHE insisted I needed (along with my psychiatrist), but realized that my therapist actually cares about my wellbeing and isn't going to tell me my depression and dysphoria are made up and I need to behave as if nothing is wrong with me.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've had mostly positive experiences with psychiatry (except for the first therapist I ever saw who was a fucking BITCH). Medication is a bit different. As someone with bipolar disorder and severe anxiety (not a misdiagnosis, thankfully), some meds have helped me, like risperidol (or however you spell it) and gabapentin for my anxiety, and my current psychiatrist is wonderful. But then I've had negative experiences too. Lithium, while it did help with mania, just kind of made me feel like I was...I don't know. I guess a subdued version of myself? And then I was briefly on Zoloft, and seriously FUCK ZOLOFT. I know that it's helped some people, which is great, but good god it made me a thousand times worse, and because of that I NEVER EVER want to be on any type of anti-depressant ever again. I've been off any type of medication for over a year now, and I feel generally okay. Sure, I still get depressive episodes, I still have manic episodes. I wish I wasn't bipolar. But it's more or less who I am. Sometimes it gets to me, other times I can manage it. I mean, I'm still alive and surprisingly have not had a mental breakdown this year and I'm almost one year clean of self-harm (something I've struggled with for over a decade). I was able to do all that without meds. I'm not anti-psychiatry and certainly not anti-meds, I know that for many people it's absolutely necessary and I respect that. But it is certainly possible to live with a mental illness and be okay and otherwise functioning without medication. And I'm always skeptical and cautious of teens being put on stuff like zoloft or lithium or anti-psychotics with potentially dangerous side effects. I don't know. I feel like you can certainly live with things like depression or anxiety without meds as long as it doesn't become a major hinderance in your life to the point where you can't function or you're suicidal (but that goes without saying). I don't know where I'm going with this comment. Short version: I pretty much agree with everything you say and I think you're great and hilarious.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I have to say I do agree with you, way too many people are over-diagnosed with way too many things, both in mental health and in physical health issues. Trying to medicate people so that they will fit into some mandated system is generally not helpful to the person being medicated, just the people around them. Trying to medicate away emotions is not helpful to the person being medicated, just the people around them. Finding medication that treats a neural-chemical imbalance, is extremely helpful to the person needing the medication, but maybe not as much so to the people around them. The easy way out is often easier than facing the actual problem. Unfortunately, taking the easy way out usually causes more problems for everyone in the long run.    Personally, I've been on and off medication for more than three decades. I have severe issues without the medication, but I managed to cope without it for a long time.  I wanted to die at least once a day, with or without the medication, but I had children I could not leave. So I just kept breathing, one breath at a time some days.  Being emotionally unstable and self-destructive is one thing, but when I lost the ability to hold a thought long enough to finish a sentence, that was not something I could breathe my way thru. It's taken a lot of tries, most of which had severe side effects, but I finally found what works for me. I have some peace inside my brain, and I can hold onto thoughts long enough to express them now. I still can't leave my house, but I am not nearly as interested in leaving life.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"On the one hand, it sucks when people are over diagnosed. But on the other hand, other people are in some ways UNDER diagnosed. I myself was just considered to be 'retarded' up until I was about 15, and the proper way to address this was with derision and mockery. Around the age of 15 I was finally diagnosed with autism, and got the help I needed. After this point, I began to flourish in school and in my social life, whereas I had previously struggled. Similarly, my parents just thought that I listened to too much angry music and played too many violent video games until I was about 14, when I was diagnosed with depression. After this, I was put on medication, and (for the most part) stopped trying to kill myself.   I find that a lot of this comes down to both race and class. I myself am of the lower/working class, and as such received my diagnosis of 'retardation' from my pediatrician. Even when I did finally see a real psychiatrist, he turned out to be unlicensed. Most of my psychiatrists have been similarly flawed. I would also be remiss not to mention the role race plays in all of this-specifically in the public school system. While the schools I've attended have all been majority white, they have been somewhat diverse. And of the sizeable black and latinx population, almost all of them have been placed in special ed. This is very interesting. On the one hand, students that are not disabled or mentally ill get placed in special ed due to poor performance caused by outside sources (such as the lead paint you touched upon in your last video). On the other hand, some of these students are in some way disabled. Several of them are almost certainly autistic, but absolutely NONE of them are diagnosed, which prevents them from receiving the right sort of assistance.  I also feel like it's a poor representation of the psychiatric field to discuss whether or not depression and other maladies would count as 'diseases'. Again, drawing from personal experience, I do not consider either my autism or my depression to be 'diseases'. I consider my autism to be a disability, and believe that I should be given extra accommodation and care for it, in much the same way that somebody with broken legs would be provided with a wheelchair. As far as depression goes, I don't know what I would call it. And while some of my depression is caused by outside forces, it's much higher than it rationally should be. No amount of fixing my problems will end it, and I need my medication to function properly.  But that's just my two cents.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I shit you not, I've gone through mostly the same thing- at an early age doctors used my heightened anxiety and being socially reserved as an excuse to classify me with autistic spectrum disorder, which, I guess they can just diagnose any child who's an angsty introvert as on the autistic spectrum these days- years later I was prescribed Zoloft to make me 'less anxious'- the only thing I really noticed from it is it made me into a lifeless sack of shit who was incapable of giving a damn about anything- and now we reach the present- which also shares similarities to your story- at 15 I was diagnosed as having some form of 'OCD' like yourself- except in my case it was connected to my rapid weight loss, they wanted me to go to some goddamn 'treatment' center but I just told them to bugger off because I'm happy with my body for what it is and I'm not going to listen to someone else about how I need to change that or try to appease someone's standards of what my body should look like.

"I was given drugs for ADHD and depression when I was young but I stopped taking them and refused to do so... until I had no other choice.  My gender dysphoria spiked at a certain point and I had no way to deal with it because I refused to accept it, which fueled my depression to a crippling extent.  Happiness is literally impossible for me in that state.  I was dead inside.  I lived at least two months like that until I decided, 'You know what?  I need to get medicated.  This is ridiculous.'  Now my depression is relatively tolerable but if I were to ever stop taking my antidepressants, I would be forced to go back to that state.  I find that the problems with the system are that harmless behaviours are viewed as mental illnesses and that when someone is suffering, the problem is thought to come from within a flaw the patient has as opposed to a toxic environment.  In this sense, if you're unable to tolerate being abused, you're seen as mentally ill and your environmental factors are ignored because, 'Well, there's always gonna be assholes, sweaty.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I had been trying to get gender affirmation surgery for 17 years. I finally have it funded and scheduled. The problem is, is you have to go to psychiatrists and psychologists to get signed off on a physical problem, so in the meantime while the puberty of the wrong sex is ruining your body, psychiatrists will try and give you every diagnostic in the book to 'treat' when in reality all those diagnostics are because of suffering from a physical problem. I feel this is why men and women going through a transgender experience are stereotyped to be mentally ill. I blame this on the hurdles put in place by the WPATH, point your finger at them.

"Very interesting points however I would say that it is a skewed view you have, all perspectives are, I am Irish and have experiences with psychiatry that I call half of my fucking existence thus far. From my admittedly limited knowledge, the US has so many instances of complexes where bad things feed the interests of the people who control the politicians by financing their campaigns whether it be in making sure there is always a war going on for PMCs or in private prisons wanting more inmates. For me, it took a very long time for any idea of a drug to appear and they were always very carefully administered, I have only had one instance of pretentious diagnosis from a professional after a single session, otherwise, I have always been made to feel like I was being carefully considered and that my cognitive dysfunction was an inhibitor to a simpler life rather than something that made me objectively incorrect, if I am using fancy vocabulary, that'll be the times I spent reading old novels and just simply reading the dictionary or learning Ancient Greek because I wanted to be able to know the etymology of words and construct my own ones, all through this cognitive dysfunction and I was always told that maybe I wouldn't have interest in some things like I did that I would get complete detachment from all I once loved due to going on a drug but importantly, I wasn't just like a commodity that my parents could do anything over, I always thought it was ok, that an invisible hand wasn't putting money into a doctor's pocket as they wrote a prescription. Apologies if that appeared to be a bit irrelevant, I just thought I would sort of give an idea of what another perspective might be from another country that might not be so free market as the USA. Again though, all my experience, some doctors are asshole and some people think certain diagnoses are romantic and manufacture them through their self accounting of what they feel.

"Yup, I've had a similar thing happen to me. When I was a junior in high school I went to a school psychologist because I had been compulsively creating stories and fictional narratives which I obsessed over to the point that I couldn't focus on anything else. She said (perhaps rightly) that it resembled OCD to her and she recommended that I see a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist talked to me for about six minutes and then casually declared 'Yup, OCD. Here's a prescription for sertraline'. The sertraline proved to have a weird effect on me, namely I had a few short hypomanic episodes (basically I was restless, nervous, couldn't stop talking or pacing for a couple of hours) as I was taking the pills. I told the psychiatrist that at my next visit and she casually said 'Well, you're bipolar. Here's a prescription for anti-seizure medication.' I took those pills for a couple of weeks uring which I couldn't even sit upright in a chair because they were messing with my brain chemistry apparently. Then my mom took me to another psychiatrist, who actually talked to me for, like, more than 10 minutes, and told me that I was perfectly fine  a well-structured psychotherapy should be enough to deal with my compulsion. So, yeah, psychiatrists are a pretty mixed bag.   Plus, being a high-schooler while going through that was pretty shitty. I have a bit of a dramatic personality (not drama loving, just enthusiastic and displaying a variety of emotions), and when I was a senior one of my teachers joked about me being bipolar when she saw me sad shortly after being cheerful and happy. I said to her 'You know, you have quite an intuition, because I actually was diagnosed with that at one point.' I expected her to get uneasy about making fun of me, but instead she started doing it more often. After my graduation I sent her a long e-mail detailing my story and asking her not to make fun of mentally ill students in the future. She never responded.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"In my particular case, my parents also sent me to psychiatrists and therapists when I was very young and physically immature. I wasn't really diagnosed with much of anything oddly enough, even though my behavior was very much beyond what my parents, teachers and peers thought was 'typical.' My brother was and is diagnosed for ADHD and I have no idea if he really does have an issue like this, or if the drugs that he constantly does not take help him in any significant way.   Now, after spending months with a therapist I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, a case of hypersensitivity rather extreme (both in a physical and emotional sense) and mild body dysphoria due to me being trans. Thanks to my involvement in psychiatry today my life is significant better and manageable, allowing me to feel confident in going to college soon and becoming independent - plus the drugs anyway but Zoloft has done a good wonder for me, as far as I can tell.   I will mention for the sake of consideration that in elementary school, I would consistently bang my head against desks and walls if I remotely failed anything, would cry and react horribly if someone said a word I had played in scrabble was incorrect in any way and would sob in a corner during recess on occasion due to everything being 'too loud' and/or someone said something remotely mean or rude to me, plus other nice things. Needless to say, therapy and psychiatry when I was younger did jack-shit, and it really shouldn't have done anything anyway in my mind: treating emotionally immature kids like people with issues and diseases as if they're fully grown adults is not a good way to go about such issues. Not that I have a better answer off the top of my head, but I've always hated the industry for it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Most psychiatric diagnoses isolate the person from the environment. They get the whole framing the problems wrong. They ask 'why isn't this person well-adjusted to their situation?' when they should also ask 'Wait, could a shitty situation be at the root of this person's distress?'  So that's a great point about the school system. You could extend that to hierarchical society in general. Systems try to mould individuals so as to be useful, not to realise themselves as persons. In other words, psychological problems are much more of a social problem than a private problem. We need to make the society better at the macro level in order to get mentally healthier people at the micro level.  Yet we make pathologies out of behaviour which signals that something's grossly wrong with what the system expects from them.  I know this is a cliche quote from Krishnamurti, but ... 'It's no sign of good health to be well-adjusted to a sick society'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Had a rocky childhood and adolescence, abusive family, people who exploited my vulnerabilities due to particularly terrible incidents.. Was diagnosed with depression. I'm treated for ADD and started transitioning from M to F in 2013. Ex was a rapist, that was 2 years ago. Have eaten seroquel, zoloft, cyproterone, mirtazapine and valium.. am taking ritalin (whether or not I have ADD or post-abuse brain problems like the hippocampus shrinking.. it works for me that's all I care about), spironolactone, progynon.  If I understand what you mean by effeminate neurosis.. I also had something akin to that but I was 14 at the time, not 15. I went through an 'emo period' (as a few kids around my age did at that time) but to be honest.. It was a time of elation until people pressed me up against lockers and literally spat on me. It's weird. The whole thing meant limitless freedom for my self with make-up and gender expression.. I sorta started understanding I was bisexual but like, everything was twisted in my head still because I couldn't make sense of myself gender-wise. I loved femininity as much as I hated it.. and I hated it as much as I wanted it. This lead to precarious perspectives of myself and women. I despised 'effeminate' words like 'wonderful' as a 5 year old.. and as a 15 year old I quickly grew into an angry ball of sexual frustration and MRA ideals. Family life at that point had collapsed, all anger turned inward and outward with nowhere to go because I was trapped. First psychologist was a narcissist.  I got better though. HRT, introspection.. A fuckload of shrooms and some LSD and I'm beginning to look like a person again.  I don't know if you're still making sense of your identity and I don't know enough about you, but you love reacted another comment where I asked when you were gonna transition. If you are questioning things, go to wikipedia.. Read about HRT for transpeople and its effects, apply that mental image to you, feel how it makes you feel. If it feels good, why? If it feels bad, why? What feels bad? What doesn't feel bad? Like, I don't mean this in a bad way, i.e that I distrust your capacity to self-determine. Because I know you're a rational educated adult. I'm just saying that like, if you're walking in the dark.. don't be afraid. Explore yourself and how you feel about yourself. I don't know what a 'functional adult' is really, because I haven't seen them in my friends or my family.. that's why I'm writing this paragraph.

The side effects of previous medications span the gambit from sleeping 15 hours a day to completely decimating my sex drive to gaining weight to my personal peeve: not being able to drink alcohol. I will probably have to take medication for the rest of my life to just maintain. The problem is that the medications cost an enormous amount. When my pharmacy screwed up whether I take a generic or the name brand of Invega as it pertains to the formulary of my insurance they told me that the generic would cost $1300 for a month's worth of pills. This is just one of the pills I take and the generic at that so there is something definitely wrong with the profit motivations of these companies. I do know about how much they spend on R&D and how it affects prices but the cost is prohibitive to most anyone unless they are exceedingly rich or poor enough to get on medicare.

"1. How was the octopus after frying it?  2. I don't fully agree with *everything* in this video (most of it, though), but I'm on board being skeptical of for-profit medicine. Something we should probably start to recognize: every business model revolves around bubbles for infinite growth. Where people do actually live with what I would call a disease (schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, etc.). A lot of less-serious stuff is very over-diagnosed for the sake of money.  But even the less serious things like depression can get more serious, and if medicine helps, 'disease' is appropriate. The big thing, though, is everything has to be overconsumed for today's models to operate to shareholder/board satisfaction. Because a company has to be growing to be considered healthy, a company based on health is interested in treating more people. So people have to be divided and labeled in a manner that encourages more consumption.  What better way than blurring the lines between serious conditions and stuff being more emotionally intelligent would fix. Learning to fish creates independence, being given a fish creates dependence. Now, the issue with this is that it's often taken as an attack on people who legitimately need medication. And it also can reinforce people who say 'medication is bad.' So it's really tricky, because medication isn't bad. But the pharma industry is very, very bad - because again, it's about putting you in an information vacuum (individual bubbles) and profiting.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
