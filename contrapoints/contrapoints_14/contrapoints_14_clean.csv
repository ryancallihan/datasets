"I think that complaining about cultural appropriation is just an easy way for the white left to make themselves feel good. A way to absolve their consciences for not tackling the real issues of discrimination and exploitation. Leaving aside the few instances where the intent is mockery, by and large people who copy elements from other cultures do it out of admiration. I don't see how that can be condemned if not by prigs. In my experience most members of minorities don't give a s* about cultural appropriation and those who do it's because they perceive it as mockery ON TOP OF DISCRIMINATION, EXPLOITATION AND RACISM. Without those underlying real problems nobody would care about it. Complaining about hairs and costumes is idiotic on so many levels because not only nobody is harmed by cultural appropriation but the complainers trivialize racism and drown the voices of those who fight against real discrimination. Cultural appropriation: a manufactured problem to distract attention from real life problems.

However make it 'spiritual' and make up a bunch of cool sounding names and you have made it 'other' and sexy.

"Very good, agreed with much of it, and thank you. Some constructive intended criticism now. It wont be entirely accurate as i don't have time to review vid - I have one main issue of discontent here, and that is based on my romantic relationship, and multiple deep friendships with indigenous people here, mainly Lakota, Dakota, Nakota, and dine tribes. The indigenous community I am tied to is suffering from an epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women (#MMIW). The headdresses are a ceremonial item, only used in sacred context, and only by men traditionally. The cultures here are dealing with erasure, but are NOT wiped out, they are still here. They demand to be respected. When a young sorority girl dresses up in a sexy squaw outfit, she is doing a lot of things, but one is sexualizing a demographic that has a target on their back. Look up Duluth MN, in regards to human trafficking of indigenous girls and women. See the movie 'Wind River'.   The other things being done, are perpetuating the erasure (which you did somewhat here) and taking sacred items and disrespecting them by sexualizing and cheapening them in mockery, with the festy headdresses girls are wearing.   Its cruel and tasteless. In a 400 year legacy of disrespect. It needs to stop.   The rest, ok, I agree.   Thanks for your vids. You're brilliant.

"Denim pants were used by workers given its durability and low price. When teenagers became a thing with holden caulfield and post war, jack kerouac etc etc. teenagers started differentiating from adults and having very little money at their age they would adopt the working class look. That's a purely north american thing and still it has some similar aspects to white people wearing dreads except you change ethnicity (there are no real race difference between humans as there are with other animals) for class. I don't see any trouble in that. Now, when denim clothes became a style thing instead of a practical thing brands started to exploit this and charge a ridiculous amount of money for a thing is supposed to be cheap just because is fashionable. This is the exact same thing as a brand charging you a ridiculous amount of money for a design in a shirt that was originaly taken from peruvian art.

See when you're white more than likely your hair is thin and straight, so in order to make locks with natural hair like that what you're actually doing is breaking and damaging your hair, and now the only way out is to cut it off. Whereas black people lock their hair in place, is takes that shape naturally and can be reversed. Think as dreadlocks as a form of braiding whereas white people with locks are intentionally matting their own keratin strands.

There are Hispanic people and Black people who know a lot about our culture before it was 'cool.' But it gets destroyed in a way I can't describe when white Americans try to talk about it.

"I think Lindsey Ellis's video about Pocahontas is a really good exploration of some other ideas about cultural appropriation- most notably the fact that the term itself is a neutral that takes on a negative and/or positive meaning depending on context. Also as for the workplace discrimination based on white dreads, I will note that part of the issue with white dreads that I've heard discussed but not seen in the comments is that for black people dreadlocks are a natural hairstyle that keeps their hair healthy, whereas for white people dreadlocks are formed by matting hair together and not washing it, damaging the hair and making it filthy, even to the point of occasionally growing mold inside the locks themselves. If my understanding of the situation is accurate, many white employers deny black people the right to have their hair in a natural style due to concerns of professionalism and 'hygiene.' Obviously employment discrimination based on hairstyle is a cop out used by racists to justify racism, but I can understand why white people turning a perfectly normal black hairstyle into a nasty mat of hair in the perception of many white people might ruffle some feathers. To be fair, I have no idea if it's actually possible for white people to have clean dreads and the mold hair people are giving even other white people with dreads a bad name. However, I think that considering why white people with dreads aren't getting hired versus why black people with dreads aren't getting hired might go a little deeper than the dreads themselves. Obviously this is a super old video but whatever","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You did acknowledge that it is complex and touched on the power imbalance present in cultural exchange, but I wish you went in more there as that is where I become ambivalent. On one hand, I am inclined to think that appropriation of culture is just cultural exchange, and that it is not intrinsically wrong. But when I consider how such exchanges unfold, when I recognise that one party of the exchange has advantage over the exchange and that this compels the less powerful group in the exchange to submit to the preferences of the more powerful group, I realise that one group is set up over against the other, and that it is not an equal or fair exchange. Once subordinated, what is possible for the less powerful group and their culture, is largely determined by the more powerful group. And there is no reason for the more powerful group to listen to anything the less powerful group has to say. That is what makes me the master and you the slave. So, I am ambivalent about cultural appropriation because it really is a complicated issue and I don't know if dreadlocks has anything to do with it. I am not sure if my decision that a cultural exchange is fair and neutral or a reflection of the power I yield in the exchange, like, is it my place to decide if an exchange is fair, because I am inclined to think that the other party ought to have equivalent say in that. The ambiguity of it all lol","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The main issue I've heard in regards to white people with dreads is how, for many of us, it is impossible for dreads to form in a clean/natural way, so it's more of a hygiene/hair texture thing.

"The funny thing is, that literally everything is culturally appropriated, including us humans. Ideas spread and some are adopted. This is trade and commerce at it's roots. This is how all cultures are built, through adopting new ideas to mix with the old ideas, or sometimes replace them (usually a good thing, but not always).    If cultural appropriation was made illegal, we wouldn't be able to play music. No, I meant music, period. Not just _some_ music. All music has been created by mixing different ideas and melodies, and all genres of music have come from mixing other genres together. So, no cultural appropriation = no music. And that's just one example.      Here is one for instance: I was just watching one of my fave channels, a guitar learning channel: Tim Pierce. Tim has been a session guitarist for many years and has played on a lot of albums and one song he was invited to play on was _Black and White_ by Michael Jackson. Apparently Michael loved Motley Crue at the time and wanted the bridge to have that feel. Hence the _Dr Feel Good-esque bridge part. But now we have cultural appropriation and Michael can't do that, but wait, Motley Crue is a blused based rock band at it's heart, so no more Motely Crue. And damn, it turns out the blues is a melding of African music and Celtic music, so no more blues... or country, no jazz ofc. Need I go on?  Edit: To clarify, my perspective on this is that especially here in America it has been the melding of cultures that has given us all that we have that is best and great in my estimation. Certainly as a musician I have to say that without The blues, country, jazz, bluegrass, swing, rock and roll, metal, rap, techno, etc etc, Without all of that, who are we even as modern humans? Can we not have our own modern culture as well?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I wanted to learn some of the music, with a traditionalish instrument. While I balled on a budget.  The cumbus has an interesting history. Mustafa Ataturk visited the US. He *loved* the banjo. A turkish instrument manufacture combined the resinator of a banjo with the frett and strings of an oud, played with a plastic quill (kind of like a pick).

"When it comes to cultural appropriation, it's very important to look at the individual cultures.   For example the Chinese Qipao (from what I have understood from a nb white friend who actually went to China and actually asked Chinese people themselves if it's okay for them to wear it) is only to be worn at special occasions. Business meetings etc. are also part of that. (If I am mistaken, please correct me). So the girl who sparked outrage on Social Media because she wore one to prom is, essentially, not in the wrong. It's when you start doing racist shit like running around screaming 'cHInG ChANg cHoNg!' and/or using your fingers to mimic Asian eyes WHILE WEARING A QIPAO, that it's appropriation and straight up mockery. So it's important to understand the rules of the garment... and just not be racist little shits.   The Japanese love it when people from other countries wear their Kimonos. They encourage their culture being shared and love to see other people's takes on their original garment. That is not to say that there aren't other traditional Japanese garments that do have some sort of more sacred meaning. In that case, again, knowledge is key and people should do proper research.   We can't be offended by Polynesian people being offended at (white) people copying their sacred tattoos just because they 'thought they looked lit'. Some cultural things should be left alone.   So again, knowledge is power in this case. Research is key. Respect is important.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The Kecak dance clip from the documentary, 'Baraka' (shown at 3:39) is an interesting choice in a video about cultural appropriation because of its history:  'Kecak was originally a trance ritual accompanied by male chorus. In the 1930s, Walter Spies, a German painter and musician, became deeply interested in the ritual while living in Bali. He adapted it as a drama, based on the Hindu Ramayana and including dance, intended for performance before Western tourist audiences.  This is an example of what James Clifford describes as part of the 'modern art-culture system'[3] in which, 'the West or the central power adopts, transforms, and consumes non-Western or peripheral cultural elements, while making 'art,' which was once embedded in the culture as a whole, into a separate entity.'[4] Spies worked with Wayan Limbak, who popularized the dance by arranging for performances by Balinese groups touring internationally. These tours have helped make the kecak internationally known.'  URL","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hawaiian Ukulele appeared when Hawaiians encountered Portuguese and Mexican folk music. Mexican 'banda' uses traditional German folk instruments. Mexican culture in itself grew from the mixture of Indigenous and Spanish cultures, and Spanish culture is as well a mixture of ancient Celtic, Arab and Roman culture. Ancient Greeks built their religion on Egyptian mythology and later on the Romans did exactly the same. We Mexicans are commonly very proud of the way we prepare our 'tacos al pastor' on 'Trompos', but it turns out that miles away from us Arabs use the same process to cook 'Kebab'. There is no single group of people who can claim for itself the enterity of any cultural practice or trait. I'm not saying we shouldn't be wary of Cultural appropriation. But if Mexicans and Portugueses had taken the same level of offense back in the day, there wouldn't exist a Hawaiian Ukulele XD","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I love your newer videos, but this one was just not well researched or thought about deeply  1:35  Maybe you should do your research before just assuming that all white cultures have never been oppressed (And to even say that just because a culture was never oppressed, that it is automatically ok to be clearly racist towards those people?). First of all, you showed a picture of a sports team that uses a stereotyped image of an Irish person. As an Irish woman, I can tell you that you are so very wrong in assuming that no other cultures ever were racist to or severely oppressed us (There's a good reason why the Irish hate English and American people).   And don't EVEN get me started on St. Patrick's Day. The celebration, decoration, and commercialization of this sacred Irish holiday is probably the biggest form of cultural appropriation I have ever seen, but it's never talked about because we're 'just white people' and therefore can't be appropriated?? Just something that bothers me a lot, would have liked it if you'd done more research and thought about different opinions before just assuming.

"This is still a valid conversation, even though the vid is old, so I'll add my 2 cents. Individual things like hairstyles, clothing, music, food, etc. are fair game. And if it's legal to give it away, then it's legal (should be) to sell it. Your points are pretty good, especially about conditions like priviledged people 'appropriating' marginalized people. Led Zeppelin played blues in their own style because they liked that music. They openly cite their influences in interviews; they certainly aren't hiding it. They made money on it...were they supposed to share it with someone? On album notes, sure as fuck they should credit individuals-wouldn't it be bizarre though if they just said, 'Thanks to black folks for laying the foundation for our music'. However, rest assured that virtually no 80s glam metal guitarists credited Eddie Van Halen every time that slapped some two-handed tapping into one of their cut n paste solos. Food: I love Mexican food. That is to say, I love tortillas, cheese, grease and guacamole. Can I (as a white guy) design my own derivative dishes and open my own Mexican restaurant? Why the fuck not? It's about the food, and the food is good. Or, must I only enlist people with Mexican heritage when I want a taco? Hairstyles? Wtf... it's hair. If you have hair, and you like a 'look' do it. Nobody owns a style. Where any of this becomes a problem is when, like you say, its aim is mockery of a culture or stereotype. Like words, it's the intent behind them that matters. I hate the word appropriation in this context, cause I just know it's going to get misused and overused by over-sensitive people who think they are heroes for throwing it about.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I hung around the UK new age traveller scene in the early 90's - aka took shit loads of ecstasy and went to illegal raves (Castlemortan the cherry on top of the cake - URL and dreads were everywhere.  I for one gave no thought to where/why etc people had dreads, but hey it was one hell of a party back then and that was more the focus :-)  We didn't give a shit and through my life lens that seems like a nice way to approach life , but maybe I was/still am dumb.

There is an argument that 'cultural appropriation' is wrong and now I see we now have 'Blackfishing' where some girls (not sure I recall any blokes) are pretending to be black and they are ridiculed (rightly in my slowing shriveling mind).

"Viewing cultural exchange as a struggle between ethnic groups with differing levels of power makes for an interesting descriptive model but I'm not sure how people can justify attaching value judgements to it and treating it as a proscriptive model. I liked the point you made about culture not always corresponding directly to race, which to me seems to undermine even the descriptive part of the idea. Though in the interest of fairness I'd be willing to believe that whoever came up with the idea probably just meant it to be purely about culture and had no idea that SJWs would hijack it as part of their helter-skelter ideology. I'd like to add that the concept of cultural ownership is also poorly justified and highly ideological and that the idea that borrowing culture from a less powerful group than one's own is necessarily harmful is not well evidenced.

For example, much of what we see as historical Japanese female 'culture' actually was appropriation from Chinese female culture. I see nothing offensive about geisha dress.

Fact is all countries and cultures 'culturally appropriate' things, and then many cultures mix and create a brand new culture which is beautiful b/c of it's many influences, and what is known once to be part of one culture associated w/ a particular music or religion, soon becomes part of another, and ppl should all be free to enjoy it and be a part of any culture they choose. Ofc like u say, ppl shouldn't exploit and rob a culture either, or use slander against them like certain football teams do, and certain halloween costumes.

Having an Indian mascot? so what, it makes reference to a group of people. So effing what? this is nonsense and a huge exaggeration. Which is born from the idea that people do things related to other races with malicious intentions.

"I think that this idea that western culture only colonizes and that other cultures are appropriate is a bit naive. Influence between cultures has always existed, in fact there are countless examples of back and forth between even very distant cultural aspects. Also any culture that adopts something from somewhere else adapts it to a new context. I think that americans have a very violent racial segregation past and that leads to more sensitive attitudes. Still it looks like some cultural aspects are more visible and viewed as appropriation, while other remain invisible and out of critics. In my country most people love eating halva, yet few know it was brought by greek emigrants, in fact many know it for its most famous brand name, and not the real name.

However, you kind of leave it with the impression that you think people shouldn't complain about this sort of thing. I'm writing a chapter about this in my PhD thesis so have done a lot of digging on the subject. Mimesis has been an academic topic of discourse for a long long time - but it would have been nice if this video had acknowledged where this RECENT (highlighting not shouting) hype around the subject has come from. You kinda covered the point that needs to be made with the football team names, but it would have been good to have included the  Navaho. They've been on a 16 year long mission to get the support of the United Nations to protect thier sacred cultural artifacts from being touted at festivals by those same white dreadlock SJWs pissed up and off thier knackers on mandy (aren't we all a white dreaded SJW of out teets on mandy, at heart? 'we're tribal like you'). Or the Inuit who had his design stollen and sold for PS600per hoodie. Those instances should not be lost because some black girl wanted to project some shit at a white guy with dreads after half reading an article that obviously empowered her to be a racist, agressive tw*t.  The trigger to this whole modern day outrage was a very important part of this discussion. It is a genuinely sympathetic argument for the need of some legislation around this issue.

"Instead of labeling something as cultural appropriation, it might be a better idea to actually give an argument for why you think something is bad behaviour. People tend to think it's enough to say 'you are appropriating' to someone, without giving any argument. But because it's such a broad and vague term, this hardly suffices. It's way better to state directly why you think someone is not sharing the culture but undermining it. I am all for sharing cultures, even if they're not yours, I honestly don't think there's something inherently bad in that unless it becomes a mockery that degrades the cultural influence of the people you're appropriating. I'm a liberal progressive, but I'm done with people who think that labeling something as unwanted in any way is a good argument for other people to change their mind on a subject. And actually taking the time to talk and explain something to someone might give you a new perspective on other people's worldviews. And that's worth something, even if their views suck.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Excellent video (as always). We should ditch altogether the concept of cultural appropriation as it is currently used, for things that either can be more accurately named differently, as 'disrespect', sheer racism or whatever. Other things are just completely harmless, like white people with dreadlocks.  The concept of cultural appropriation is pure cultural essentialism, and that's not only wrong but also very dangerous, and opposed to any real anti-racist struggle, IMHO. In that sense, I fully agree with what Appiah says here about the issue: URL  Having said that, I think there are two cases in which the term 'cultural appropriation' makes sense:  1) When members of a culture or a country claim that something belongs to that culture/country when it doesn't. Case in point: Israelis claiming that hummus is Israeli.  2) When people attributes universal values exclusively to the culture/civilization they belong. For instance, many people in the 'West' claim that certain ideas (freedom, individual autonomy, democracy and so on) would claim that those are purely 'Western' ideas that may or may not be spread to other 'civilizations', ignoring the fact that the same concepts figure prominently in many other places outside Europe. (See Jack Goody's The Theft of History on this).  Other than that, 'cultural appropriation' is either, at best a misnomer for something else that is bad or, at worst, a recipe for the radical separation of different groups.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Personally, I think white people and other people in positions of authority shouldn't discriminate black people with their natural hair and traditional (or less traditional) hairstyles. On the other side of things, people should really take a second to consider: does 'not brushing your hair and letting it naturally (almost every straighter hair type naturally tangles up as long as its free of oil) tangle up in separated portions' equal as culture? Can a group of people own 'not brushing your hair' and forbid people of other heritages from not brushing their hair?   Black people who critizice the way 'white' locks look like, at the same time complaining about white people disliking black locks, you're horribly hypocritical, saying that other people shouldn't be allowed to wear a hairstyle because of YOU not liking how it looks like.   I care about cultural appropriation, the kind that actually is appropriation and harmful. I also care deeply about racism issues. What I don't give a fuck about, is someone not liking how my hair looks like, no matter who it is. It sucks that there are black people who feel appropriated by other peoples hair, which must make them feel bad, whether I agree with them or not. But if I don't brush my hair, I'm not appropriating your culture.  You cannot own matted hair, or a certain size or amount of braids.

"This was a well thought-out and reasoned video, as usual. This is a topic which I feel a lot of people either zealously defend or zealously disparage, as with all vaguely political topics on the internet. Now, I am an American white man, but I think, generally, the main rule one should follow when thinking about cultural appropriation is that of respect. This may sound reductive and obvious, but this is culture we're talking about. Cultures take things from each other  all the time. Sure, this taking hasn't always been peaceful, but in our increasingly globalized society, it is nearly impossible to live out in the world and utilize something that someone from a different culture made.  Though, as you have said, the very segregation of different cultures is itself an inherently bad one. If we were to actually legislate which pieces of culture certain people could partake in, then, ultimately, a free exchange of ideas that a healthy society thrives off of would  be impossible, as any person who sought inspiration from outside their group would be labelled as a cultural appropriator. Of course, this line of thinking presupposes that racial and cultural traits are the most important aspect of a person, which is a notion which breeds inter-racial fear and distrust. It is my view that the only thing that matters, ultimately, is a person's humanity. So long as they have that, they deserve to be treated with the same respect as any other person.   I think the same concept should apply to culture, though detail must be paid to the context, as that is all culture is, really. Context for why people act the way they do. You wouldn't burn a cross in your yard, for example, even though there isn't an inherently racist meaning in doing so. You wouldn't do it because, in America, the burning of the cross has been used by racists to signify... I'm not entirely sure what it signifies, actually, but I'm sure it isn't anything good.   Regardless, the view that cultures are immutable and independent of each other is, as far as I can tell, segregationist, reactionary, and wrong. Certainly, people need to understand the context of the things which they borrow from other people, so as to avoid disrespect of the originators. But for someone to say that because I'm white I can't play blues or have dreadlocks is only seeing me as a white person, not as a person. For me to dress up in any one of the Halloween costumes which you showed at the beginning of your video would be me reducing the people of that culture to little more than cardboard cut-outs of flesh and blood people, and therefore inherently disrespectful.   I can see that this isn't exactly a perfect system. How much respect is acceptable? Isn't the acknowledgement that the thing which I am partaking in came from another culture accepting the notion that cultures are separate from one another?   Oh well. I'm just some YouTube commenter. What'd you expect? An actual answer to a complicated sociological issue?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Literally every culture on the planet has had dreadlocks at some point in its history as part of the way people wear their hair, the reason for this is because when hair is dirty it matts, and rather than waste precious time and resources on stopping it they simply adopted it into their lifestyle and moved on. To declare dreadlocks as a blacks only hair style is not only racist both toward black people and everyone else but it is also demonstrably incorrect. Also for the record the Nordic peoples and many other white cultures in Europe had dreads within their culture as well. I'll thank you to abandon this indefensible position.      Also, if one is seeking to get others to be more sensitive and accepting and just... in general nicer to others, being bitchy (This is in response to 'no one cares about your imaginary problems' which is ironic given that cultural appropriation is seen as one by and large except by those that dogmatically ascribe to the ideology that pushes it) is not an effective route to get that done. It will do nothing but alienate those you're trying to win over and do the exact opposite of what you're trying to accomplish. It makes you look unreasonable, oversensitive and gives the impression that you're trying to police the hearts and minds of those around you which trust me won't win you points with anyone.  Culture should be appreciated, segregating it and relegating it to simple segments of the human race is destructive, regressive and not helpful in any way. If we as a race are to achieve  unity we are only going to do that by coming together, not by keeping ourselves separated. So I couldn't agree with you more in the sense that cultural miscegenation is the key to mutual understanding and eventual peace. I may be naive in my hope that one day humans will eventually find peace and no longer need to kill, enslave and exploit each other for personal gain but naive or not I do still hold this hope.   However I don't want this to seem like some kind of antagonistic diatribe meant to tear you down or anything of the sort. I watch your videos because I find you to be insightful even when I don't agree with you.

"I'm pretty leftist and partially Native American myself. So, it's not like I don't have some dogs in this fight.  But I have little patience for this 'Cultural Appropriation' pap.  I'm sick of all the offense and the constant stream of accusations and virtue signaling (yes, a right wing term I will gladly appropriate).  Jazz could be said to be an appropriation of European instruments and music theory by ethnically blended populations. Good, then. Jazz was the best thing ever made in the United States. And thank Goodness African diasporic people put these things to good use. Look at what they made of it.   And Hip-hop is an appropriation of Musique Concrete. The thing that makes it genius is that the tools to make it were scraped together out of spare parts and determination. Before, sample based music was the sole provenance of the wealthy and highly educated. It took entire laboratories to do for high art what a handful of destitute, opressed, and creative youths did for fun. So what if they didn't come up with the samples or all of the technology by themselves out of their own culture? They made more out of less and sold their creation better than the Academic technicians did their art. Nicely done, I say.   In that vein, Laurie Anderson was sampling at about the time Hip-Hop happened in the Bronx. The only difference is she used gadgets that cost as much as comfortable homes (like the Synclavier) to do it when Cool Herc and Grand Master Flash and all those people worked things out with spare parts and rubbish. But so many of her songs sound like Hip-Hop in more than a superficial way. And I don't think she or the original Hip-Hoppers stole anything from anyone else. That was just the time for that sound and that technology to be used that way. They just had fewer resources to do it with and succeded despite that.  But if we transported the current activist population back in time, the accusations and outrage would almost certainly erupt. The legal problem faced by copyrighted samples would have been made worse by cultural appropriation accusations -- most probably directed at Laurie. And she would not have deserved it.  You make mostly the same point, but I don't think you take it far enough. The kind of false respect reflected in this nonsensical 'cultural appropriation' conversation is utter murder to creativity and honesty. It's joyless and mean spirited, disingenuous, and self-refuting to the point of self parody. And it is not actually respectful to anyone or to any tradition. This kind of noise I am more accustomed of hearing from flat Earthers and right wing extremists.  The Redskin example is something else and you're surely right about that. It is disgusting. But as someone aware of Irish history, I think the Boston Celtics are equally disgustingly named. Also the Notre Dame mascot. People forget that the Irish were outright slaves and the victim of their own genocidal opression. I'm glad the situation has improved, but I also think it is dangerous to forget these parts of history. The Irish fought because they had to to live. Just like African slaves and Native Americans. The one difference is the Irish were paler and could eventually blend in. I think these kinds of mascots can remind us of this but don't. They can be used as 'teachable moments,' but that isn't their intent. They aren't even appropriation or carricature. They're like confederate statues. What do we call those? Intentional gloating? Cherished outrageous mistakes? Sociocultural anachronistic grotesques?  That having been conceded, I would rather have a world with jazz and racially derogatory mascots that at least remind Americans of the genocide our culture is built on.  Better that than a world where degenerate music with African rhythms and 'Spanish Tinge' could not go forth from the brothel it was invented in to change the musical history of the entire planet as testament to African diasporic genius. Along with Hip-Hop. And Laurie Anderson's avant garde work.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I was relieved to hear you say 'they may have just been too polite to tell me'.  Few cases aside that I'm glad to have seen in the video, I wouldn't expect POC to have the energy to directly say to me 'hey, would you at least mind crediting black and brown culture with this look, that, for you, really 'gets you in touch with your spirituality', or whatever ?' We should really just know better than to take from what we do not associate with white culture.  If some POC take issue with white folk using a hairstyle with which black culture is associated, why is that not enough to reconsider it?  Those who may not have the energy to approach you about it (and what could lead to aggression from fragile white people like us) don't speak for all poc, but just because some black folk like your hair, it doesn't mean that the former should be dismissed, especially since, you know, 400 years of chattel slavery and institutional racism, haven't we been entitled to enough?   Like cornrows, we know that it is glorified by the bourgeoisie when Gwen Stefani, Kendall Jenner, etc.  display them, but, again, is often denounced as 'unprofessional' by white people in 'professional' atmospheres, and the glorification of such is really where the historically-dangerous disparity comes in, as a result, as it has with music (Elvis using Big Mama Thornton's 'Hound Dog') when credit isn't given.

"I think you nailed it on the dreads argument, something I've been struggling to articulate my position on for years. I think it's gotten to such a point now where the whole conversation has soured the appeal, and whether I think it's morally right or not, I'm not gonna get dreads as a white person because I worry it would be seen as some kind of personal middle finger to black people.   But I think that's something that's problematic about how we analyze symbols over here on the left. As humans we like to know where our enemies are, we want the teams to be clearly demarcated with different color jerseys so we know who to hate, and so we take personal appearance choices and come up with narratives about that person's internal intentions to try and retrofit that pet peeve into some kind of instantly visible moral failing. The truth is, moral failings are rarely instantly visible, and I like to think ours is the team that examines the nuances of things and people before assigning them enemy status based on aesthetics - that particular habit seems more right than left.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think the whole idea of cultural appropriation is stupid, EXCEPT in the case of something like the 'Washington Redskins'. I also understand the concept and I do see it as alo being problematic when one group in society can take something that another group has created and capitalize on it because only they have the power to do so. That sucks. However on the other hand there is no real way to enforce/prohibit something like this, when there is inequality in the system, like there was with many of the blues songs. Also, keep in mind, in many cases, by trying to punish appropriators you are also punishing some true admirers. I just think the whole appropriation idea goes too far. Celts, Scandinavian and Germanic tribes braided their hair too.  Even characterizations should be ok when it is a costume party. I am sure there is a limit here too, but I am not sure where it is. Certainly anyone who wears blackface to a party or comes as Adolf Hitler has crossed that line, but still if people do that, it does not give anyone the right to beat them up. That is their stupid-assed, dumbshit opinion and it should speak for itself against the character of those people.   In general, I think that people should be allowed to wear damned near anything they want. That is freedom. Companies should not be able to prohibit the wearing of Mohawks or Braids for the same reasons. If what someone wears is racist, it reflects on their dumbass. Period. These people should be stared and for all I care hollered at by everyone so that they know just how big of a dumbass they are being. Telling them that you think they are racists and that they suck, because of what they are wearing should also be allowed. But this is where it should stop too. If you go and get in their face about it (i.e. impede their movement, grab them, spit on them, punch them etc.) because you think it is racist and they shouldn't be allowed to wear it, well that is assault and is punishable by law.   As far as stealing intellectual property songs, art, poetry, writing, etc. goes. If you do not copyright it, it is fair game. If someone steals stuff that you made, but that you didn't  bother to copyright without even giving you a byline, an honorable mention or at least acknowledging that they stole it, well that again reflects on their bad character. People should call them out on it. Don't buy their stuff, write them a letter telling them, how they should be ashamed etc., but it is no excuse for violence against them.   If you want to protect something you make, then copyright it. If you don't then that is your tough luck if people steal it.  Hell, if music is were subject to these rules nearly every damned song out there today would have to be pulled off the charts, because nearly everything was copied from somewhere, by someone at sometime. I bet there is not an original, non-culturally appropriated thought in the universe.   I guess, I see wearing dreads or braids, cultural symbols and clothing or even playing ethnic or cultural music  a bit differently. I see this as emulation and emulation is a form of admiration.   If I was black and saw a white man or woman with dreads or braids. I would feel like at least some of them admired some aspect of my culture. To make all that wrong and call it cultural appropriation just shows me how insipid racism is that it has poisoned and embittered people to that extent.

Either that or they are actively roleplaying to sabotage the others, but those types are tragically dissmissing that what resists persists, so if they didnt make things right in their heads and opinions with another, for them, it will never be alright, even if the other is just a projection of what they feel they deserve after all masks are torn away.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"So, Led Zeppelin.  Here we go.  First Album: Babe I'm Gonna Leave You: Cover accidentally called traditional, original writer was white, later corrected. You Shook Me: Cover correctly attributed Dazed and Confused: Stolen from a white guy, sued and lost. Black Mountain Side: English traditional song credited to Page, arrangement ripped off from a white guy. I Can't Quit You Baby: Cover correctly attributed How Many More Times: A bit complicated, song is often said to be a rework of 'How Many More Years' by Howlin Wolf, but this isn't the case.  The two are completely different.  Some lyrics and melodies from Albert King's the Hunter do show up towards the end.  One could argue that these couple lines are merely a reference, but they still should have credited him.  So, on their first album there is one example of not adequately crediting a black musician.  Second Album: Whole Lotta Love: They stole lyrics from Dixon and they got caught, pretty shameful. The Lemon Song: Bunch of lyrics from various blues sources and, to my ear, a couple similar musical phrases too.  Same thing with How Many More Times, only a few bits and pieces taken but should still have given credit. Moby Dick: Riff inspired by another song, not an actionable lift but they are similar.  I Feel Fine by the Beatles was similarly inspired by the same song. Bring it On Home: First 1:40 and the last like 20 seconds are a direct, uncredited cover of a Willie Dixon song.  There's also an entirely original song in the middle.  This was originally only credited to the band, now it is only credited to Dixon, original middle part included.  2 egregious examples here and one collage thing that should have been credited.  Gallows Pole was credited as traditional.  Levee Breaks has entirely original music, and the original lyricist was credited.  Boogie With Stu actually gave writing credit to Ritchie Valens' mother rather than Ritchie himself because they heard she never saw a cent of his royalties.  That's actually a cool thing to do, I think.  Anyways, my actual point.  There are instances of Led Zeppelin not giving credit where they should for songs, but there is no instance of them straight-up covering a song by a black musician and claiming it as their own.  Even Bring it On Home, where they did cover a black blues musician and not credit him, has a full original song between the covered intro and outro.  So, did they steal some lyrics and melodies from black musicians?  Yes.  That's unacceptable, but the actual crimes get blown way out of proportion.

Whatever you do, never believe a corporation on how you should act or dress because they are all cultureless pig-dogs voracious for your wallets. And if you truly honestly really authentically do appreciate the foreign culture, try living in that place for a while to actually know what the culture is like and to have it actually have a chance to truly effect you. A little tricky if your hungry for a certain country's fashion but it's the surest way not to misrepresent it.

"I'm sure someone else has hit on this, but sports teams are named after fierce animals and historic warrior peoples. Even the Blue Jays were named the Blue Jays because Blue Jays are just tiny little *****. Not a friendly bird. My point? The Redskins is not a racial slur. It was a name for warriors. Naming a sports team after warriors is essentially a compliment. Raiders, Vikings, Marauders, etc.   The U.S. also almost always names their attack helicopters after natives. Why? Because they were fierce in a battle. Their very name still suggests strength.   Society at one point had no such notion as racism. No one believed anything was racist. (In a punishable kind of way, they knew they were making fun of a race) Now we're pushing that everything is racist. You can convince yourself and others of either of these with the exact same situation. It just depends how you set up the argument.

"Ok, but the USA is not ruled by the Irish or the Vikings either. Arguably, the history of Irish servitude (yes, it was nowhere near as bad as slavery, as some right-wing figures claim, but it was still a thing tha happened) gives the Irish just as much of a case to complain about stereotypes. Do stereotypes against Irish people not matter, simply because they're white and America is mostly run by white people (who aren't even Irish, but apparently that doesn't matter)? It seems to me an awful lot like you're just being a hypocrite.  Though this is mostly good. Mocking a culture vs taking ideas from a culture is an important distinction. I don't really care about appropriation at all - it's the natural evolution of culture, but taking credit for someone else's idea is a dick move, whether they're part of the same culture as you or not.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Led Zeppelin have not been accused of cultural appropriation; they or members of the group have been accused of theft of intellectual property. Because of this, cases have been brought in the courts. The success of these cases has been limited not by the law but by the imbalance in the resources employed by each side.   This means that the objection made on the grounds of cultural appropriation and the blues is that no white person should play the blues even if due accreditation is made. I doubt that the same people would be consistent if there was any objection made to a black person singing opera or dancing classical ballet. The Lefties should consider the attitude of the communist government in Cuba: that all of  Cuba's cultural heritage is open to all Cubans regardless of their race.   If African-Americans had been limited to only traditional African instruments on the grounds of objecting to cultural appropriation, we would not have had jazz or even the blues in the form we know it. And in consequence no rock and roll or rock music. The musical loss would be enormous.   We have moved on from music being taken and given to white performers because music producers think that white people will not listen to black musicians. Rap shows that audiences today demand authenticity. We should encourage creative musicians of whatever race to build on our musical heritage and focus on ensuring that the talent in writing and performing is properly rewarded.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I've mostly considered 'problematic' cultural appropriation to be done out of ignorance or apathy.  An example of the ignorance type is using dreamcatchers as 'bad dream catchers' (not the original intent, at least not that I know of) or simple home decor. They were originally created as good luck charms, and looked more like spiderwebs than most mandala-looking catchers. It's kinda like when kids learn a new word without actually knowing what it means, then blurt it out; my little cousin did this with the word 'porn' and he got in loads of trouble at school, but he didn't know what it meant in the first place, otherwise I'm pretty sure he wouldn't have said it. Stuff like that is just honest mistakes, and I imagine the usual response to being told of an object's true meaning would result in the person apologizing for misuse, followed by corrected or stopped usage.   Apathetic cultural appropriation is when someone knows that they're misusing a cultural artifact, but don't care that they're spreading misinformation and using the object or symbol incorrectly. 'Fun' examples of this are demonizing deities (making Satan look like Pan for instance, which was 100% intentional) and using familiar cultural words (words people of a culture use to refer to themselves or other people of the culture, but isn't as friendly when a stranger to the culture uses them; n***a and Jew are two words like this) without being part of the culture.  Stereotypical costumes seem to be a weird blend of the two. A Pocahontas costume with eagle feathers (weird example, just work with me here) might be worn by someone who isn't aware of the importance of eagle feathers in Native American culture, but could also be worn by someone who is aware of their importance, but doesn't give two shits because 'it looks cool' or 'fuck those SJWs'  If you find an aspect of a culture like a certain festival, custom, object, or symbol to be both cool and relevant to you, and you use it for the same purpose it was originally created for, I don't really see too much of an issue with that. That includes dreads, for me. Then again, I think dreads tend to look messy and unkempt on most white people that have them, maybe due to them not having the same type of hair or not knowing how to care for them. Black dreads are to white dreads as Monet is to a finger-painting kindergartener, basically.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"white people cant have dreads, and i mean this in the literal sense. dreadlocks are formed by having tightly curled hair types like 4a, 4b, or 4c (perhaps 3a, b, and c as well, im not sure at Exactly what point dreads naturally form) and twisting them into a neat lock pattern, and white people dont tend to have those types of hair. instead, white ''dreads'' are made by damaging the hair or even gluing it, and are not actual dreads. theyre mats. other differences include that dreads are healthy and can be washed, but mats can not be washed without risking mold growth, and that you can remove dreads by untangling them and still be able to keep the hair, but mats will have to be shaved off.  so, since calling matted hair 'dreads' shows a fundamental ignorance in what dreadlocks even are, id say it falls into the category of appropriation and mockery","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"When your a white person, that lives in a mainly East Indian City (Surrey) I even got bullied in grade school in another language from my own in good ole Canada. Hence, there are differences in cultures and it's nice to be surrounded by your own. East Indians in Surrey don't feel bad that they mainly speak Punjabi (half the ppl over 40 don't know English). I literally can't communicate with anyone else besides my bf in my household. Because there's no white people to date LOL. I wear scarfs around my head to protect me from the sun and Chinese fans. Nobody complains about cultural appropriation of Asian culture where they are the majority. In fact I get compliments in suites ALL the time. The point is that enjoy what you have. If you are the majority enjoy THAT because there is comfort and familiarity. If the majority of the community tends to be yours in that area it also means that your higher on the social ladder because really most whites in Surrey rent and Indians own the houses. (Obviously outside Surrey, delta, white rock is different. Etc.) If you aren't the majority integrate, find new spices, words, clothing, and enjoy it.

All's good.   I laugh how everyone says never wear an Native head dress. Yet I go to a rodeo set up by the Blackfoot almost every year. And every year they sell fake head dresses for everyone to wear. I told the guy selling him about this cultural appropriation. It took about 5 minutes before he even understood what I meant. Then he just had a big laugh, and said well screw them, I need to make a few bucks too. :)    I just wonder when this absurd I'm offended at everything crowd, which I think is 80% BS. Mostly just people who are unhappy, looking for another outlet to take out there anger on other ppl. And social media is perfect for that. Cause no one can really react to you in real time, and most of them are anonymous. But I hope eventually our culture swings back to sanity...","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've read articles written by indian americans about how they went to a yoga studio that displayed indian characters upside down etc.... an of course you could pay an actual yogi to do this and not some white hippy. You could also be a white person with a 'sexy stretching and also my heart tho' class. There is a family I see around that is a white woman with dreads, and a black man with dreads, and their child. Who am I to tell her how to feel about this. I do think sometimes white people identify with black people and are dreading their hair in solidarity. Your point that white ppl having to be employed despite dreads is interesting. I just feel like this is all a shallow attempt at defending your own dreads. I've read articles about how I can't use the term 'fuccboi' because black women invented it and I believe that but I think it's become a feminist tool to have more language than 'rapist' vs 'boys will be boys' when it comes to abuse. Sure this is nuanced but unless I have a REALLY good reason to disagree with a disenfranchised party I will just assume I don't know what the fuck I am talking about and leave it alone. Pay people from india to teach yoga. Also Lena dunham was a reference? who the fuck thinks she's a SJW and not just an asshole?

Of course wearing a caricature as a costume is racist but it's not even in the same ballpark as taking influence from other cultures.  Also Led Zeppelin never 'covered' songs... they stole riffs, lyrics, melodies from black and white artists alike. But they never plagiarized a song through and through. Think of it more like a complicated patchwork of different musical ideas which is how most musicians actually write. The real culprit is Elvis Presley which was deliberately put in place by his producer as a white ambassador of black music.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm Argentinean. You can dress as a tango dancer and dance it horribly as Hollywood actors do, you can try to dress as a gaucho (and probably end up with a weird-looking mexican costume in the attempt) in your Halloween party, or you can drink mate with your friends. I will probably cringe about it, think 'oh look at that idiot mocking my culture', find it weird to see it abroad, and maybe feel a little bit proud about it in some cases. But I will never, EVER insult you, go across the street to yell at you, tell you you're doing it all wrong or whine about how your are stealing my culture, or attack you.  Traditional culture and ceremony must be protected and preserved in the home community at all cost, but outside that sphere, fuck you mate. Culture is property of all people, and everyone can mould it , mix it, change it and recreate it. Yankees dress in big sombreros and mock the mexican culture, yet mexicans picture americans as fat cowboys eating burgers, and guess what, they are both in the correct. Just a little advise, don't do the cowboy shit while in Texas, and don't do the sombrero thing while in Mexico DF. You can't mock the culture inside the, let's call it 'cultural safespace', and not expect repercusions.   I can't recall now the name of that shithead youtuber that did the filmming of the suicide forest in Japan, but he should be jailed. Japan had absolutly every right to be offended, and still they did the most humane thing that can be done: they expressed he was an idiot, irrespectful ''typical' american, and kept on with their lives. And with their culture as well. These extreme situations are the only ones capable of being frowned upon. But forbbiding a blonde little girl in NY from using a Moana costume for Halloween, well that's just a whole new level of mental sickness. Worst of all, hawaiians aren't the ones complaining about it, but other whites 'in the name of the sacred culture of Hawaii'.

"I feel that a bigger problem of cultural appropriation is when large corporations take advantage of a society and then makes a profit off of their identity. An example would be seeing t-shirts, earrings, necklaces and almost anything else with an image of a dream catcher. Yeah it cannot be copy righted but it is a part of Native American identity. It would be preferable to buy the real thing instead of an imitation. Now as for kids making dream catchers then as long as the subject matter is handled correctly then it's fine. Sure, a member of the culture may not be immediately available to go into full detail about the subject matter but that doesn't mean the idea can not be told tastefully. Really once again it comes down to colonialism and the long lasting consequences of a culture being exploited.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You didn't actually talk about cultural appropriation. You talked about instances in which the concept of cultural appropriation is misapplied or used in exaggerated ways. Then came the conclusion that we should embrace cultural miscegenation. Okay... Cultural appropriation is about making minorities invisible by indulging in what they produce but not who they are. It is not white people doing things that people of color do, it is taking those things and removing their origin, context and inherent meaning.   So the Led Zeppelin example applies because they assumed ownership for the songs and by extension, erased their origin. Eminem is not an example of cultural appropriation because he honors hip-hop and would never divorce it from its origin, context and meaning. If anything, he broadened our understanding of those. White people explaining to you that Eminem is the greatest rapper that ever lived, that's cultural appropriation. That's what pisses people of color off more than anything. It's when meditation becomes about stress release as opposed to a religious practice. Yoga becomes about stretching. Sure they're useful practices, that's why they get appropriated to begin with! The value of what's being appropriated does not justify its appropriation.    Yes, human culture has always evolved through cultural exchanging and merging. Early jazz musicians we inspired by Debussy. That's not the point. Making it about cultural miscegenation is appropriating the discussion on cultural appropriation: bye bye origin, context and inherent meaning.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Well it's a little more complicated than that. The power imbalances are clear to you when they occur within the US, but there are major global power imbalances (contributed to mostly by colonialism in places other than America). I don't want people to close down yoga studios either, but it can't just be dismissed off-hand the US is so powerful that now when someone says yoga I picture a white American woman doing bendy stuff in Miami. And I am from India.  This IS something that needs to be discussed and it IS something that people should be more aware of. There's basically nothing the people with the original culture can do to prevent the regurgitated distortion of what they used to do coming back home to swamp them. Like has happened with black music. Even when people 'ethically' do it the result is still the complete take away of the thing that they came up with. Isn't that something to be genuinely concerned about?  I think it is important when a culture's things are taken by another culture and then, within a matter of years/decades spread by this other culture around the world and even back to the place of its origin. I am not saying don't do it, but I still think it should come with some sort of sensitivity to what is being done. Also the culture that 'takes' the thing usually only takes some weird bastardised thing and most of the meaning is lost.  The effect is vastly different based on the culture and place that is doing the appropriation. US culture is _exported_ everywhere, it is perfectly safe. When Eastern Europe is obsessed with Bollywood it has a totally different effect than (if) the US were to suddenly get inspiration from large Bollywood set pieces.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I mean the Led Zepelin thing is just plain intellectuial property theft, though they may not have realized what they were doing It's particularly non-okay because they stole from disenfranchised people, but it's not really something you need an extra word for. And I think just calling it 'theft' or 'claiming credit for something they didn't make' is more likely to be productive than to shout a buzzword that will just start an argument and reinforce the notion of this as a 'special interest issue' vs. 'theft' which communicates 'black authors/ indegenous artists are people and you shouldn't steal from them':  I don't even think carricatures/costumes are *always* bad (are we mocking firemen and cowboys?) though it helps to have a sense of tact, & keep in mind the effect of one's speech, as with any expression, ie someone's always gomnna be offended but you shouldn't go out of your way to trample people's feelings or rub salt in their wounds. For example 'Blackface' - as in the particular carricature with the big red lips & the earrings etc, not necessarily any makeup that makes you look like a different group - originated as a tool of opression so it's a tad like displaying a confederate flag and it's almost impossible to do it 'innocently'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"To me this seems to be an imposition of American Viewpoints on the rest of the world (in India or Japan they  even welcome it if you appreciate their stuff) and ultimately subscribes to essentialism and the fallacious doctrine of 'pure' cultures.  A lot of cultural goods we have today were created through syncretism, imitation and mixing. Christianity was Greek orators ripping off the hebrews.  Speaking of which: I don't 'respect' a cross or a military uniform so why should cultural symbols from anywhere be given this kind of untouchable reverence? I mean of course you're more responsible for criticising your own culture & should reserve judgements with things you understand less, but what's with affording utterly manmade faily universal things this 'srz bzness' factor, especially when it winds up limiting creativity? Shouldn't philosophies or practices or fashion be things that represent good ideas which might spread precisely because of that goodness?   This doesn't mean that one shouldn't acknowledge *why people are actually angry* - The problem is not some blonde chick with dreadlocks, but how black kids get hassled for their hairstyles, how indigenous artists don't get paid,  the terrible living conditions on reservations, how hard it is for asian actresses to find jobs, the lack of positive representation  etc. Ifthose were fixed no one would sweat this kind of thing, just as no one throws a fitr when a Japanese cartoon borrows Christian iconography for aesthetics.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Cultural Appropriation deals more with post-colonial struggles between a minority and ruling majority.  I do not agree you should dismiss the Irish 'cultural appropriation'. They were a heavily marginalized minority in the US itself. Post-potato famine, indentured servitude ( which was quite common for the Irish to serve such contracts). Their sub-citizen status persisted well into the former part of the 20th century and, slowly, dissipated with the influx of the black population into urban areas. This is where they had to compete for jobs which only exacerbated already prevalent racism towards the black community.  Other than that good video.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I feel like this issue is overblown.  There are a few people who are way too extreme about it, and then there are the 'anti-SJWs' (for lack of better word) who focus on the most offended and exaggerate it.  In general I feel people should be free to express themselves in any ways they want, but simply stop and listen if there is some sort of objection to what they are doing rather than taking offense.    An example of this is wearing a feathered head dress.  Sure it looks nice, but is it really celebrating indigenous cultures?  Is it honouring it if the person wearing it has no idea what it means?  To me if they wear it without knowing what it means, they are simply proudly showing their ignorance.  I think asking someone wearing it if they know the meaning of it would be a great start.  I will paraphrase Canadian Mi'kmaq poet Rebecca Thomas on what she says the head dress means (and please correct me if I am wrong).  She said that a head dress has to be earned.  It is something given to a chief for the work they have been doing for their tribe.  It is not something that just anyone wears.  I felt like she was mostly offended at the ignorance of the culture rather than the object itself.    I think a parallel to this would be if any random person wore a military uniform.  In some places (such as Canada), it is actually illegal to impersonate a soldier and wear medals they did not earn.  If someone went to a Halloween party dressed as a soldier, some people can claim they are celebrating soldiers and veterans.  Others might be offended at that display and say it is disrespectful.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm not sure HOW to draw the line, but I feel like it's 'morally obvious' if you take some time to think about individual examples. For instance, wearing clothes made by Japanese, Indian, and First Nation (Native American) clothing producers, including very traditional clothing, is 100% fine because they have explicitly invited the west to purchase and wear their products. Indian fashion industry is huge and they export all the time. Japan's ancient culture is losing traction and they rely on export to keep their methodology preserved. Native Americans are our forced neighbors, so we exchange all the time.  HOWEVER, this doesn't include, for instance, shitty Halloween costumes (for reasons of mockery) but ALSO doesn't include products BASED on those cultures, because the people they belong to don't receive any sort of benefit from it. If traditional kimono makers in Japan got overtaken by fake american-made kimonos in the market, not only would it be disrespectful to customers expecting high quality and customary production methods, not only would it be disrespectful of Japanese people, but it would also indirectly contribute to harm against Japanese culture.  This is a problem with us and our First Nations people as well, since many retailers are using the designs of traditional clothing without actually paying anybody for them, and without that money going to the appropriate culture. They are not doing well financially, and taking their ideas for profit is immoral and bordering on, if not actually illegal. Similar to large retailers stealing indie digital artist's designs and selling tshirts for a profit the artist will never see a dime of.  So In SOME cases, it's not about a white person wearing moccasins, but rather the story of the purchase and creation of those moccasins.  This coincides with another important aspect: CULTURAL BLESSING. When Japanese kimono makers say that white people can and should wear their kimonos, that's a BLESSING and should be taken into consideration.  In my neck of the woods, 'smudging' is a popular culturally appropriative hippie practice that involves burning bundles of sage as a magical/spiritual ritual that 'cleanses' an area of negative influence, frequently done upon moving into a new room. As this is a First nation practice and all these people doing it around here are white, it's clear they're barking up someone else's tree. However, a white friend of mine made friends with a local tribe while hiking and regularly visits them and have a nice relationship with them. They explicitly gave my friend permission to practice smudging. If that doesn't count for something, I'm not sure what does. When my friend performs this ritual, the only thing different between them and all the other white people waving around roasted herbs is CULTURAL BLESSING.  There are other factors that matter a lot but this is all i have the energy for right now.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

As for traditions, I personally see no value in them and find them silly. My question is: Does culture benefit anyone or would it be better to reevaluate your values based on science and facts (with the goal to firstly minimize suffering for ALL people and secondly to maximize happiness for ALL people) and not base them on how things (kind of arbitrarly/randomly) turned out in the past.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

People with dreadlocks have tight, kinky curls and people with matted hair have straight hair. The two hairstyles are taken care of differently, develop differently and have different cultural meaning. So while both can occur naturally to each hair texture, I believe that white people with straight hair who matt their hair on purpose are culturally appropriating. Even then, if you'd like to matt your straight hair because your ancestors did, well, don't call it dreadlocks and please realize that your ancestors probably didn't matt their hair for the same reasons people wear/have dreadlocks.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Black people get fired from their jobs and kicked out of school for wearing locs. Locs are deeply ingrained in all Black culture, not just amongst Rastafarians, and yet we get punished for wearing our hair in ways that are most natural to our unique texture. I don't want to see white people wearing locs just because they think it's a trend while Black people have to suffer for it.  I also disagree with his music stance. They most certainly ARE distinct difference between Black and White music. Black people all of the world (including Black Americans) have their own culture and have created their own music out of struggle. To have white or other non-black people then steal that music and use it to profit, when they don't even understand what that music was born out of let alone respect the culture - that is a problem.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I believe the line between cultural appropriation and appreciation is that appropriation happens when there is some element of colonizing above. When an idea is attributed to a culture, it gives them the power to control its representation in the minds of people. For example, when hip hop is said to be coming from the black community, it means that the black community has the ability to control how other people view it. Cultural appropriation reduces that power by breaking the connection. This means losing the ability to control how other people view said culture. Power over a culture is important is because it gives status, respect, some degree of control over their lives. Take away that power, you lose leverage.  So when a cultural majority argues why can't they simply take a piece of a culture without some understanding or refuse to acknowledge it's origins, then it means reducing a minority's already disadvantaged status in society. You are;   (a) reducing the perception of said culture into a caricature because you'll be able to cherry pick parts of the culture without consequence from people who understand the origins of said culture  or/and  (b) determining the limits of what the culture should be as an outsider, almost akin to the logic behind colonialization. That an idea can only be as good as how the cultural majority posits it should be nor can it be improved without their input.  or/and  (c) taking away agency from the cultural minority to shape how other people view them. This means if they don't have additional cultural value, then they don't have something to show to the world, they can't profit from it, they can't better their lives from their hard work but suffer to see someone else living through it.  All of this is not an argument to say that one person cannot learn or be part of another culture. What it is saying is that in the process of doing so, one should acknowledge and respect the origin of it and remind people of its origin because as a cultural majority, you will be the default representation of an idea to outsiders.  TLDR: You can appreciate, but stop acting as if an idea is yours in the first place and the latter is appropriation.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

That is of course, beside 100% of all Gurus, mystics, holy hermits etc., being depicted with dreads. So In that sense, the Indian sentiment behind dreads seems to be one of functionality - not having to care for one's hair, either because they think it doesn't matter (like with the hermits and ascetics; it has to be noted that neglecting hair care is one way to make dreads), or because they think it isn't a priority (exiled princes in mythology expected to survive in a forest for years)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"A big problem with the whole dreads argument is that dreads really don't work in white people's hair, that shit rots. It's more of a tangled mess of knotted hair rather than the dread*lock* which only works with black hair which has different structure.   As for cultural appropriation, I think it's a bigger thing than just white people with dreads, they're not really the problem? The problem is big companies finding authentic businesses like Mayan Weavers and taking their genuine products, mass producing them, and running the culture into the ground for profit. White people with dreads is just a good way of putting the argument more simply.  The main point here is that you shouldn't blame people of colour for getting angry at this stuff if they do, you should be angry at the racists, white supremacists and assholes who have made race relations soooo fucking difficult for everyone involved.

"As a leftist myself, I think we need a line here. I feel soon speaking another language would be 'cultural appropriation' I find 'cultural appropriation' to be a bullshit term altogether. There is, liking and appreciating other cultures and integrating them into your society/life, because of that, or because they are close to each other,  and then there is racism. The USA neoclassicism 'culturally appropriates' ancient Rome who 'Culturally appropriated' ancient Greece. Christianity appropriated paganism in Europe in order to make Christianity work. The Quran has Bible references in it for the same reason. Hell, if aliens come we'll integrate what we like from hem and they will do the same, this is how societies work. A small example: Pizza does not originate in the USA. :)  Blackfacing a white model for a photo shoot in Africa instead of highering a black one is not 'cultural appropriation'  Making a chocolate and naming it 'Litlle ni**er' is not 'cultural appropriation.'  It's fucking racist. Let's call it what it is.  Eating sushi. Or having this and that hair, this and that pattern in your clothes etc.. is not 'Cultural appropriation' nor it is racist. it's how societies work.  The numerical system is Arabic - should white people stop using math because of political correctness? (I'd like to add on the Zeppelin problem - Doing this is shit, regardless who wrote the songs. )  Mocking other people's culture is either racist, xenophobic, or ignorant at best. And it's not okay even if said culture is white, imagine that. But since white people aren't victims of constant racism, I am not sure we can consider lame logos and mascots a  problem for white people (Especially if they are made by white people?). Not on the same level as they are about people of color at least. This is where the difference comes from. It might be xenophobic or ignorant, but it's not racist.  It's not okay to just say 'It doesn't count cause they are white.'  without a better explanation. Especially when you claim you want equality. And it's important not to think this way because there are instances where it is a problem - building a sculpture of a toilet and naming it a certain country is one real-life example I can recall. But I can tell the people angry at that 'set yourself on fire and die, cause no one gives a shit'  cause they are white and they should shut the fuck up, right? Well, it doesn't sound right to me.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thank you! I never believed in cultural appropriation, at least, not how most of the left puts it( And I say that as someone who is openly a left-wing who openly believes that the term 'Social Justice Warrior'... Considering the contexts where it is used, should be treated as a compliment, not a insult ). Please, allow me to explain my own logic.  So, if a white person uses a symbol of a non-white culture, it is usually because of one of two reasons: A: Because they do not understand the cultural roots of that what they are using, or B: Because they understand it, and have a sincere interest on that culture. Fairly rarely will you see someone wearing a cultural symbol specifically to mock it( Like, who wears dreads 'ironically'? ), and on the few cases you do see it( Aka: What you showed on the beggining of the video )... It is really damn obvious and not actually what is being discussed half of the time. Main point being, in either the A or B example, what is the message that is passed when you insult, mock or deride someone from using a symbol of another culture?  'You have no place amongst our culture! You shall never have a place amongst our culture! Our culture is our own, and a white like you will never, and should never pretend to understand it! You should stick amongst the other whites and do white things, because you are white, and you are not entitled to have any interest on other cultures...' Now, this may SOUND like I am complaining about white people being victins of 'racism'... But I am getting at somewhere bigger here. Basically: You are activelly punishing someone, for taking interest in your culture. Meaning, you are encouraging then NOT to know more about black history and culture, you are encouraging then to see black culture as something completely alien, and perhaps the most important part, you are encouraging then to only know black culture, from what white people have to say. ... And let me tell you something: What white people have to say on black culture? It isnt nice.  Summarising, I think this kind of behavior activelly encourages white people to become racist, or at least to show no interest whatsoever on black culture and as such, never learning about their culture, it becomes easier for then to believe the bullshit of white supremacists and believe black people are just a bunch of savages with no culture. Before anyone comes ranting at me: Yes, I am aware of the fact I am white and I did not actually experienced prejudice because of my race. I am aware you all know about this subject a lot better then I do. So, if you want to rationally explain why  I am wrong instead of insulting me...","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I actually was just having this conversation with a friend. You see, I don't fully agree with cultural appropriation. Rather, I believe in Cultural MISappropriation. Which means, if you like a certain style, or a certain food etc. and you wear it etc., so long as it is realistic, and not done in a stereotypical and degrading way, than I don't have a problem with it. When it comes to more complex things, such as full out tribal garb or particular stuff with a complex history, I recommend doing some research on it first. So your cultural appropriation is truly cultural appreciation, and not cultural MISappropriation. For example: you like the 'dot' on Indian women's foreheads. Do some research. Find out the 'dot' is called a Bindi, and that one of its traditional purposes is protection. I personally think that the whole issue around Cultural (MIS)appropriation is more relevant to the wealthy and powerful- like politicians, celebrities, etc. Those that are not the average joe/jane. Because, yes I get my box braids, but I get no profits or gain from them- other than my own personal happiness. If I was Miley Cyrus however, than that would get more of a base for it. Plus, cultures mix. I MYSELF am living proof of that! (Mixed). And if you want to be a true staunch advocate of cultural (MIS)appropriation , then you need to stop doing ALL things : vampire, werewolf, gypsie (to name a few). - Those are MY people. (Romanian). Following it to the T means that we must go back to living in caves etc. because cultural appropriation would not stop at style. It would technically fall into technological, medical, scientific, etc. discoveries as well. Do I believe that it exists- yes to a degree. But that it is blown highly out of proportion. That's my opinion though.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

No, it comes from a group of people who slaughtered far more natives than the British, French and certainly not the Irish. Mexican culture is more or less a close delineation of Spanish culture. So it's white people appropriating other white people culture.  So this guy is just pedaling generic fuck white people rhetoric.

"appropriation is such a hard topic to discuss because it's a kind of racism that doesnt seem that problematic until a bunch of people start doing it. like if you were the only white girl out there with box braids and corn rows then people probably wouldn't have a problem, but when a bunch of white girls do it it starts to seem a lot worse especially when you see magazines praising white celebs for 'new' hairstyles that have been around for a while (kind of like the hair version of the zeplyn example). Im pretty darn white so i think it would be shitty to say that i understand what it's like to have a piece of my culture stolen because i dont and i probably never will,but i imagine it probably feels like when someone else steals your jokes or style or starts immitating you while simultaneously trying to pass it off as his own and that feels horrible so i can only imagine what it would feel like to have that done to your entire culture. i do think some people get mad about stuff thats harmless but id probably be on edge too if i felt my identity getting stolen and comodified, so i tend just to avoid stuff that might be seen as appropriation because i dont personally feel like something as trivial as getting cornrows for myself is worth potentially offending someone.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think cultural appropriation and cultural exchange has to be discussed in relation to history and present day reality. No one group has the ultimate ownership over ideas, fashions, traditions, food, dances, etc. But history and power dynamics matter.   Example: Most black Americans can list at least 3 European royal families they've learned about in our school system. Most White Americans know nothing about African royal families or any African country histories.   I think we can all agree that some exchanges are good.  Sushi is good (let's all enjoy it), samurai swords are awesome (let's gawk at them or collect them), but Ghost in a Shell movie with a White woman as the main character is terrible (let's stop doing that).   I think the anger comes when White people exclude people of color from their own stories. Or make fun of people of color for expressing their cultures, then turn around and profit from that culture.  Examples:  1) Black people with braids are viewed as threatening, White people with braids are seen as cool, fun, exotic, etc. (See ''Boxer Braids''),  2) Asian actors can have great Kung-Fu moves but no sex scenes, White guys with Kung-Fu moves gets all the sex","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Aw, I wanted to like this because I did really want to see a good argument for cultural exchange vs cultural appropriation but I feel like you kinda just brushed CA off with '[strawman argument] made by white people'. And if you are certain you didn't, perhaps consider that Lena Dunham might not be the champion that nonwhite people want for their cause... In fact what you highlight with the 'Lena Dunham sushi issue' is the issue of false white performative allyship, where white people make a big show of being against ____ social issue without caring to really understand it in order to give the palatable appearance of someone who does. Granted this is a huge issue that ultimately derails a lot of cultural appropriation arguments so maybe don't listen to white people on the topic, altho perhaps a video on 'white people saying things to look 'woke' to other white people' might be a good video. Or would that be encroaching on self-parody? I'm sort of joking.   I also feel like the 'only white people hated my hair' statement is an issue because of multiple reasons, of only which some I should go into as i'm gonna be late to work. One of those is that, well, I feel like you're pretending that black people feeling the need to not harass white strangers for the sake of their own safety is some ancient history. To be fair you did sort of address this briefly. Next, I feel like you're also ignoring the fact that during the time you had that hair it WAS a different social and political climate in the USA. I'm not saying that police slaying of black people didn't happen or was even less frequent but you couldn't really tune in to your daily Facebook Live feed of it like you can today. We're even numb to cold hard real numbers and statistics because '342 deaths' isn't nearly as shocking as witnessing one or even the aftermath of one. Because of that the public at large, including black people, was at the least CAPABLE of being a little more ignorant to the more dramatic effects of racial disparity. For better or for worse, that's very much in our faces now. Also, keep in mind that it's considered more rude in america to call someone racist than to be racist, so you'd better have a darn good reason for doing it. Lastly you HAVE to admit that there are probably a million factors that lead to you having sample biases more so than a few quick words can brush off.   Anyway, there's a lot more to this but maybe we'll meet someday and discuss this. I really hope you circle back to this issue someday in the future once you've heard more PoC and especially black voices chime in and no longer consider, ugh, Lena Dunham the representative of it.

"There's nothing wrong with white people using black culture, but there is a problem with white people using black culture to 'act black'.  For example, when white people use 'black' slang, or white musicians use 'black' fashion or dance moves, they're often using them to signify 'blackness', and with it, traits associated with 'blackness', such as rebelliousness, sexual lasciviousness, hedonism, and primitiveness.  By using 'blackness' as a proxy for these traits, they perpetuate stereotypes about what it means to be black, while denying actual black people the right to define their own identity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"My main problem with cultural appropriation as a concept is that it seems to make people part of these strange culture units. I get that people have a cultural belonging, but I don't think cultures are somehow entities outside us that we latch on to, I just see them as umbrellas under which we categorize different cultural traditions, aesthetics and ideas. I think that cultural belonging is just a description of the kind of culture you consume and thus popularize.  So I don't really like the idea that people need to derive their worth from their culture, thus I don't think it should make sense for anyone to get offended if a culture is insulted. At least not when we're talking about ultimately trivial parts of culture, such as traditions and art, rather than more substantive and impactful things, like ideology and code of conduct.  I myself happen to be of nordic ancestry. At least I think that's mostly what I am. My light skin,  blue eyes, blond hair and being a citizen of Sweden would indicate it, but frankly I have no fucking idea if I have old or semi-recenti-ish ancestry anywhere else, and I don't want to know. I feel as if not knowing that helps give me a sense of not having too strong ties to any one ethnic(tribal) group. It's kind of the same with me proudly not knowing under what astrological constellation I'm born, I think that shit's silly, so in case anyone asks me, i'll be able to condescendingly tell them that their shit is so stupid that I don't even know what category of it I'd belong to.  Where was I? Right, I'm probably have some substantial old-norse heritage, but I don't give a shit if I see some goofy and ridiculous/downright insulting depiction of vikings, as long as I think the depiction is just for fun. I only care if you're trying to actually mock real people or if you're actually perpetuating meaningful substantial misunderstandings about a culture.  Maybe that's partially because the my security in my own privileged lifestyle dampens that blow, but I think we should all strive to not give a shit about those kinds of things. Unless we're talking about something on the level of those old depictions of black people with the jet black skin, crazy eyes and giant lips, which seem to be mocking and expressing disgust and contempt with a  group of actual people, rather than just some stereotypical depiction of a culture, I'm honestly not really sure anyone should care.  So if someone wears a cartoonishly stereotypic mexican outfit or some such ridiculous thing for Halloween, I'm not so much going to feel that that's insulting to anyone, as much as I'm going to be puzzled as to why they thought that would be an interesting costume, ore one that's thematically fitting with Halloween. If someone does a stereotypical depiction of a culture, then it probably is just that; a cartoonish caricature of a bunch of cultural baggage that incidentally is also associated with a group of actual people. But the culture itself cannot be offended. The fucking sombrero isn't going to catch feelings, and I don't really see why people who enjoy the rest of the culture the sombrero tends to go with ought to either.  I don't think you're part of a culture, you're just the consumer of it. It's kind of like brand loyalty, some people like certain game publishing companies, and this is recognized as something that should be absurd and it's accepted that brands and shit like that shouldn't be made personal. But such brand-loyalists as consumers are part of demanding and celebrating the titles that brand puts out, kind of like how I as a metal fan am part of consuming metal music and culture.  I would only get butthurt about someone mocking metal music if they seem to display an ignorance of what metal music is or can be, or if they're openly insulting. And even then I tend to feel that I'd be a bigger man for not caring. I don't give a shit if they do some cartoonish stereotypical depiction of metalheads, even though probably most of the people who like metal don't conform to the metalhead stereotypes(such as ways of dressing(including me)).  I can see why playing around with exaggerated and crude stereotypes is fun, and I don't think it needs to be taken seriously. So if someone wanna wear a stupid costume crudely based on a culture, I don't care. It could just be playing with exaggerations, and I'm fine with that.  Fuck this got long, there is no way anyone read this. Oh well, 10 internet point to anyone who did, I'm not cutting this magnificent comment down.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Sociology has a term for when cultures mix, and exchange equally between each other, and that is diffusion. Diffusion is what a lot of people think cultural appopriation means but I think that's too wide a definition. Where the line is though does seem to me to be rather blurry. But here's what I think.  Diffusion happens between equal people groups, it's what happens when commerce is going on, when two groups begin to exchange back and forth and learn from one another, appreciating the value and beauty of each other's culture.   Equal being the operative word.  But what of cultural appropriation? I think this term has less to do with diffusion and more to do with colonization. Imperialist, colonialist cultures dominating other cultures then appropriating (aka stealing) their best cultural aspects (art, music, clothing, philosophy, even theology) and evolving from it, but giving nothing back at best and giving the worst of our culture back at worst (aka homophobia and transphobia becoming rampant in Africa after White European and American colonization)  So what is this we are doing when we focus on cultural appropriation and try to see where we might be stealing (just as racism, homophobia etc can be subconscious and systemic, so can this), and where we are engaging in an equal and worthy exchange, where they're getting back as good as they're giving, where we aren't using something from a culture we colonized and still are in the process of decolonization (dismantling the imperialist or racist structures of power differentials) or where they're gladly sharing with us something from their culture cause they want us to grow and evolve in our own culture (enthusiastic consent).   I think that term is key, decolonization.   The problem with white culture in particular and especially white American culture in specific is we don't have a lot of our own culture we haven't colonized from someone else. And that's something we might have to address. Even the complete and utter misunderstanding of Irish culture around St. Patty's day annoys the heck out of me considering how the Irish were treated for the first couple decades of the American colonies (a four leaf clover is not a shamrock goddamit)  And that's my thoughts. I do think it's a complex process. Just the other day I got in a discussion with some feminist friends about by ballet teaching wife performing Nutcracker every year and using cultural icons for the different cultural dances, is this appropriation? None of us could seem to agree and some people might say it is and others won't. I don't know. I think Chrisiousity had some good thoughts below on how to navigate it all a little. In other words, don't just shrug it off, it is important, and listen when someone says 'hey this feels like you're appopriating my culture.' Have respect.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I can only describe it as insanity: that it's okay to be a hypocrite because of something that happened in the past, not even in ours or anyone involved personal past, but in a past none of us had anything to do with.

"I think most people(literally almost all) know cultural appropriation does not exist because culture is not a tangible thing that can be owned by any person or group.

Also, you don't need to care nor is it wrong to not care about what other people think about what is almost always a simple fashion choice like having dreads or wearing a certain hat.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The problem with white ppl who have dreadlocks is that they arent actually locs, they are unwashed and matted hair clumped together into chunks. While black people's hair NATURALLY locks together like that. If a white person had kinky curly hair, i wouldnt care if they had dreads. The problem is that white people adopt this style to appear urban, edgy, and alternative. White people do this all the time, they take black culture to appear counterculture. This is why rap audiences are mostly white dudes and why AAVE (african american vernacular english) is often stolen in order to look hip, urban, and trendy. That's really why its appropriation.  The fact that black people don't get jobs and black kids get punished in school for their NATURAL hairstyles is just another added layer of insult, but its not necessarily a sole reason why it's appropriation. Another aspect is not just hair but white girls wearing bindis, saris, headdresses, etc. for fashion or artistry. White girls wearing a headdress to coachella is mad disrespectful to the culture if belongs to. In this scenario it's much less of a costume or a caricature, moreso taking a foreign cultural item for aesthetic purposes. The problem here is that white people feel as though they can own and use anyone elses culture  the way they please without giving the proper respects. Another example of this is Justin bieber making a song in spanish and then totally buchering and mocking it when he didn't know the lyrics live. Don't make a fucking song in spanish if you can't respect the language or culture. The other examples i stated above have the same sentiments. White people take something of another culture they feel they have the right to do under the guise of multiculturalism and racial blending and shit but totally disrespect it and denigrate it.  I'm not saying Iggy isn't allowed to rap ever, I'm saying, if you're gonna rap you should respect the community that created that shit.

Living in a small town in a mostly white (including myself, disclaimer) European country, I have noticed its shockingly common to believe that wearing those sorts of Halloween costumes or even doing shit like blackface is 'showing how much they like these cultures or people', and as thus making the distinction between them could be easily used to outright dismiss any claims to problematic behavior under the pretense that 'it's not exploitation, it's appreciation'. In fact, I have seen that very thing happen in person. It might not be as obvious in bigger places, but I can guarantee there are tons of people who think along the same lines in places with a white majority.  Also, I find it strange that you as a white person uses so much time talking about how its no big deal for white people to wear dreads and that 'only other white people care about it' when you yourself show several sources of PoC people talking about why it makes them uncomfortable and you outright dismiss their concerns because of personal experience. Your argument for it meanwhile seems to be 'my black friend says its fine', 'religion is a lie so its okay to appropriate religious figures even if from majorly PoC religions who are persecuted for it' and 'PoC need to appeal to white people for them to be allies' which seems like an incredibly flimsy defense that ignores some very real concerns brought up by said PoC writers from earlier.  I think its great that you bring up the stuff about Led Zeppelin and such and you have a fair amount of good points, but your entire view on the matter seems to be somewhat colored by your own frustrations with 'SJWs ruining our fun' and as thus becomes way too defensive of your own personal views and focuses way too much on the reactions of some stupid white people like Lena Dunham, and involuntarily even repeats certain right-wing pundit talking points in the process.  At the end of the day, I think we should try and be more respectful towards other cultures, but also be better at listening to different people than just the loudest people who aren't actually affected directly by an issue. Next time Lena Dunham starts saying something that sounds questionable, don't take her at face value, do research from people these issues actually affect, locally if possible sure but also online from strangers, and try to understand where THEY are coming from before putting our own personal views as on-lookers, or the views of other on-lookers, as the end point of the discussion.

"I personally would consider crappy Halloween costumes/crappy sports team names cultural appropriation, as they are in fact taking a very narrow aspect of a culture (along with plenty of stereotypes, misrepresentations, etc.). Similarly, having dreadlocks could arguably be considered cultural appropriation as well (although what culture is being appropriated is up for debate as you point out).  What makes some cultural appropriation 'okay' and some cultural appropriation bad is how it negatively impacts the culture being appropriated. For example, if your cultural appropriation is actively caricaturing or misrepresenting a culture (e.g. shitty Halloween costumes, works of fiction that misrepresent a culture, etc.), then it is obviously not ethical as that imparts some degree of harm to the people of that culture. However, if you use an aspect of a culture as inspiration for something new, but not as a (mis)representation of that culture, then it's at least more likely to be ethical (e.g. white people with dreadlocks).  This is at least how I like to think about this cultural appropriation. It's definitely not a black and white issue.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think a lot of people confuse exchange for appropriation when discussing this topic. Exchange is simply when culture bleeds into another and ideas get picked up (see how Japanese animation was inspired by a lot of American animation, and then this is reciprocated with American shows using similar styles and concepts) this doesn't occur as a result of a power dynamic. Often cultural appropriation is a capitalist thing, where I come from Poppies are a highly revered symbol, there's a cutesy family dinner type show over here called The One Show, and one time they had the Cookie Monster on, and he was wearing a poppy. There were numerous complaints and people were upset. Now if the Cookie Monster was wearing a Native American headdress with lots of feathers I think the same types of people who complained about the poppy would decry those complaints as 'SJWs whining about nothing'. The same people probably don't see an issue with black and white scarves intended to be symbols of solidarity with the Palestinian people being turned into just another fashion commodity by ignorant people and in turn the machinery of capitalism. The British would be incensed if poppies became a fashion item, an accessory, but that's not something we have to be worried about because our culture is very dominant, no one is turning our symbols of respect into costumes.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think what's lost a lot of the time in SJW discourse is that in American culture in general, deescalating a situation is often seen as a sign of weakness and threats are so vile and horrifying that showing any sign of weakness feels like we compromise the whole.  What bothers me more isn't that we have SJWs who feel this militant about cultural appropriation issues, it's that the wider Western and particularly American cultural context that SJ issues in general are discussed in is so absolutist and so warped that having a nuanced view means that some asshole might take that as license to do something stupid and we just took a massive step backwards.  I'm not trying to castigate white SJWs for this either. They're off the hook for the most part imho.   When trying to have these discussions with regressives often comes down to trying to find a set of ever more granular set of absolutes and the idea of using your best judgment is as wise as me trying to decide whether or not donuts can be dinner.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i think a big part of the appropriation conversation that people ignore is the importance of the quality of the appropriative act.   cultural influence is fine if the person being influenced seems to understand and respect the thing they are inspired by and produce something of quality because of that. the issue is when someone who is of relatively higher social standing borrows an idea, mangles it horribly, and then presents it as their own idea. especially when the process ends up redefining the context or meaning of the original cultural object. white people doing yoga is fine, but when random parts of hindi language or religious mysticism  are sprinkled in by people who know little about it other than thinking it seems 'exotic' it starts to feel more like annoying appropriation.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"So can cultural appropriation be divorced for race issues ? If some artist like Led Zeppelin remixes traditional songs, does it matter they are white and the songs 'belong' or reached them via black people ?  If you forget race, does cultural appropriation still exist or is it just some dude 'stealing' songs or hair styles from essentially the commons.   I find there's something repulsive about the very idea of cultural appropriation, I feel it's not a legitimate accusation. You can't steal copyrights from the commons, that's just re-interpretation and that's a good thing. Or maybe it's just because I'm a pirate who basically does not respect copyright in its current form anyway.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"The problem isn't with cultures organically blurring or exchanging, it's when a power dynamic exists, which just seems to be a bit of a footnote in the video. Cultural Appropriation as a 'thing' would have been classically discussed under the headings of Colonialism and more specifically Orientalism. Colonial powers went over to places like India, killed a bunch of them and made themselves leaders, and simultaneously fetishised their culture. They also invaded a bunch of place for spices. It's because of the history of colonialism et. all that stuff like this is so sensitive.   Also with regards Dreadlocks, what you have to keep kin mind is that black people are discriminated against for a natural, cultural style. Discrimination against black people with dreadlocks is racist, whereas against white people with dreadlocks -while maybe the result of misdirected racism isn't really on the same level. I feel like the discussion of stuff like this could be more nuanced but I'd definitely side with the majority of black activist youtubers who seem to be against it, being myself white.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I think this video was a little less well researched than some other videos you've made, although I still really enjoyed it.  First, a few small nitpicks. You contradict yourself-- you say you got a ton of compliments for having dreads, then you say you couldn't get a job (or more accurately, were told you couldn't get a job).  I also think you missed one important question, that might make your inquiry more fruitful: why do white people want to wear dreads?  What perception of dreads are furthered by white people with dread (perceived as rebellious, associated with marijuana use, associated with certain values)?  Might the result of this perception affect white and black people with dreads/locks differently?  For example, white people often have dreads to further their political image (you, for instance, say your dreads made you feel 'spiritual').  Historically, white people wore dreads and put on black face in the hippie movement during Civil Rights movements, then provoked police.  When the rally was over, white people combed out the dreads and returned to white society when they got bored of like without privilege-- but the stigma they attached to the hairstyle remained for black communities.    I guess what I am saying is, our use of things from other cultures can in some circumstances both belay and reinforce our stereotypes about those cultures and/or races.  When Justin Beiber and Miley Cyrus have dreads, they are saying that dreads of 'edgy.'  These stereotypes, controlled by white appropriators, attach to non-white people.  There is a fine line between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation, absolutely.  But just because the conversation is difficult, doesn't mean we shouldn't have it.  Even the distinction you draw between 'mockery' and appropriation is a little hazardous.  What about a white woman who wears a kimono and paints her face like a geisha because she thinks it makes her look 'exotic'-- how is this different from the Halloween costume parody example you gave?  Clearly there is some form of white woman in kimono that is not problematic-- maybe she's in a film made in China, or something else devoid of the context which makes appropriation potentially harmful to disenfranchised groups. But finding this line is tough.  I think this topic is so controversial because it is actually a really sophisticated idea which has suddenly been exposed to a public without the tools or framework to analyze it.  Like many other often mocked buzzwords, 'trigger warning' 'safe spaces' 'gender fluid' and the like, it's not actually absurd once you turn the stone over and examine it in a nuanced, fact based way.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Some tips on your Spanish: The 'd', in most cases, is pronounced more like the 'th' in 'there' (no the one in 'think'), and especially so between vowels. So 'adios' sounds more like 'ath-yoss'. Also 'senoritas' has a single 'r' between vowels which is not a rolled 'r'. The single 'r' is shorter and less fancy, and it sounds like the 'dd' in 'ladder'. Notice the difference between words like 'pero' (but) and 'perro' (dog), or 'caro' (expensive) and 'carro' (car), 'pera' (pear) and 'perra' (bitch, whore, female dog). These are not homophones, they sound drastically different to a native Spanish speaker.

When I hear a racist/sexist joke that I find funny, its BECAUSE I view it as bad that I find it as funny. The way I see it, if you were truly racist, then your reaction wouldn't be laughter but only 'so what, that's the truth of the matter.'  Of course, I wouldn't go telling a bunch of off color jokes or dressing up as a Mexican in public, its definitely situational; but I just don't see these things (or anything as a matter of fact) as an 'inherent' evil.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The only argument I strongly disagree with here is the idea that a non-white group would have to oppress a white group for an extended period of time in order for them or some cultural signs to be considered racist against white people, which I think is way too rooted in an historical definition of racism as opposed to a more practical definition based on group-based prejudice.  The example of 'Fightin' Irish' is a complicated one, as it was at a time considered a willingly racist image, given that the Irish in America were not 'racially' Anglo-Saxon or Germanic and therefore not considered fully part of American society; hence the stereotypical image of Irishmen as violent leprechauns.  However, eventually Irish-Americans themselves re-appropriated the image as a point of cultural pride and cultural identity, in the same way blacks re-appropriated the n-word; however, that doesn't ultimately rule-out the possibility of that imagery being used for the purposes of anti-Irish bigotry, as also with the n-word.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"so pretty good stuff  I agree that the indian names aren't fabulous, though I do kind of disagree with the argument that the pictures and such are racial stereotypes; i think they're more of 'indian warriors', but admittedly that nuance is kind of lost. Ultimately, I think that team names are often dumb and then they become cherished tradition, to the point that changing them, even if it would be the right thing to do in a lot of ways, is a bad idea. Maybe if 'redskins' was still recognized heavily as a slur; I've heard it's recognized in some places, but rather sparsely, and a recent poll showed that 90% of Indians weren't personally offended by it. In a vacuum, this could be a big deal, but I think we've managed to make it not a big deal, rather in the same way as, yes, 'the celtics' and other such.  other than that, I think it's possible to be a dick with cultural appropriation, but people seem to cry 'racist' not only for outright racist caricatures, but just for representations of a culture. in many cases they do it for their own personal benefit or other spurious reasons, but the more the word is used in such a fashion, the more innocent people are hurt by it and the more it loses its power. so, there's that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"If people will continue to complain about whites only using hairstyles or wearing certain clothing will it always be fair for them to do so because they may come from (insert oppressed people here) or will their ever be a point where you can say 'shut the fuck up, i can do what i want and so can you' because, whilst i would love to watch the world burn, seeing whites moving down the hierarchy ladder (if we are in fact at the top of that ladder) all the way to the bottom is not something i look forward to (because i'm white, DUH) but if it did happen i can guarantee i would not be so concerned with people wearing christmas sweaters and more concerned with them you know, not bashing my face in. Not to say that people should be happy that they aren't being oppressed anymore like their ancestors may have been, but well, does the culture really matter? I can at least understand a person who is a native american for example having an issue with certain appropriations (or maybe not at all because i'm a white dude who was born in 92 and my culture seems to be the internet, masturbating a lot and meme's) but if a black person is simply saying you can't do that because i'm black and your white, well does that mean a polish person can do it because polish jews were murdered in massive numbers as recently as the 20th century, therefore being oppressed enough to not have their inner motives for appropriation questioned?

For example, a former instructor of mine is married to a man from Ghana who already had two children. Her step children love to do her hair, sometimes in cornrows.

"The whole concept is a very interesting topic to think and talk about. dia de los muertos for example is a holiday that resonates a lot with me as an Austrian because All Hallows is a very important day in our culture as well and several places in Austria practice something called 'Schadelmalerei', which involves the excavation and painting of the skulls of the deceased as practiced for roughly 400 years. Both traditions come from the death-cult of All Hallows in Catholicism and I feel more of a connection to that that for example Halloween.  Austria especially is a cultural chimera.... most of our pastries are imported from the corners of the old Austro-Hungarian monarchy, the south has a very Italian 'dolce vita' mentality and the Kaffeehaus (as correctly depicted by Civiliation V) is a direct import from Turkey.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Interesting to see cleveland indians and washington redskins next to each other. Im not an american, let alone a native one, so I dont know how they generally (not just activists) feel about those two compared to each other, but damn, indians logo seems to be way worse. At least red skins looks like something that could be on a coin, not a caricatre. That said, I guess something like 'Huntsville Ni****s' wouldnt go down well either. Also, sorry to Huntsvillians, just a random southern city Ive picked.  Still, the annoying part of cultural appropriation in the non-caricature sense, is that mostly white people who have nothing to do with said culture complain about it. Of course, Im not going to forget those that do have something to do with it and do complain, but often even if its not a caricature and other people that have something to do with said culture have no problem with it, they still act like the appropriating person is a hostile racist. I dont think there is anything wrong with taking an ordinary kimono to an art exposition, where youre explicitely encouraged to wear it etc.  The thing about Zep? Didnt know that. You shouldnt claim youve composed something youve just rearranged, period. It is worse, when you do that to less known musicians and then everyone else thinks they are the plagiarists. Even if its public domain, attribute authorship properly.  Since we are in the UK musically, I wonder how youd see something like Iron Maiden's Run to the Hills video clip.

I can tell you with confidence that cultural appropriation is a powerful tool used to conquer the world! All joking aside, I like the points that you made in the video. My perspective (as a non-expert) is that culture is something you want others to imitate. Not in negative or stereotyping ways, but in positive, constructive ways. For example, my daughter is white, and of European descent, but I take her to martial arts classes. Some people would consider this cultural appropriation. But I think it's a great contribution from Eastern cultures; we are all better off for having it. Imitation is the highest form of flattery, right? But, like I said, I'm no expert.

"Pointing out that there's a difference between race and culture was great, as well as mentioning that race is difficult to distinguish. Both extermely pertinent points in the discussion of Cultural Appropriation.  I think the Indians/Redskins comparison vs Vikings/Celtics is pretty weak. The names/images of the former are clearly racist, while the latter are, at best, arguable. A better comparison is Vikings/Celtics vs Chiefs/Braves. I find neither of these groups to be racist (but if one is considered racist then so is the other). However, though I think each group is theoretically equivalent, they differ practically - one has more control of public image than the other (or, more specifically, has historically had more control). In this example, I think there's a (nuanced) difference between 'racism' vs 'unjust treatment'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

But we currently live in a world where only one of these is permissible. I don't think the Redskins, or Indians are racist mockeries. Sure, Redskins is a racist term for native americans, but people who support that team are meant to be saying it with pride. My highschool's mascot was 'The Redskins'. We were PROUD of being Redskins. It's something celebratory, and I don't think you can understand that, without living it.

"There are no words to express how much I love your videos!!!!  Yay for nuaaaaaance. It's really good to see people caring about others' cultures and stuff, but without nuance things just turn into rules of 'DO THIS' and 'DON'T DO THIS' which is more like blindly following, than actually thinking and engaging.  Interestingly, I just realized that I don't even know what the word 'appropriate' means (!!!) so I'll definitely refrain from using it. I think my only issue with this topic is when it takes away economic power from groups that need it most. For example, in the last season of So You Think You Can Dance, there was a dancehall piece which was choreographed by a French choreographer. *Not taking away from the choreographer* I'm sure she worked really hard and is very good at her job, but my 2 main issues were just: 1. It didn't actually look like 'dancehall'. This is an emotional argument bred from the kind of loyalist thinking I try to shy away from but I'm Jamaican dammit and I love dance and if you're gonna do dancehall then at least do it right! And 2. It takes away economic power from the actual creators of the dance. If creation of art is a viable income generator (and it is!!!) then it is only fair for that economic gain to go to those who created the art. The problem is that these people aren't the ones that are 'known', and very little opportunities exist for them in the first place. This is why the onus has to be on the 'dominant culture'...I'm sure it wouldn't have taken anything for the producers of the show to find an authentic Jamaican dancehall choreographer IF they had the mind to do it. These are the things that would fuel money back into our economy, and ultimately help our communities grow. It just sucks when you see people making money from something on such a large scale, when others who are actually responsible for that art, don't have that opportunity.   But ultimately, THAT MINDSET (^) is fueled by greed. In this unfair world, it would better to just accept the way things are, and try to make the most of the opportunities one is given. I think 'third world' people have a much better time understanding and accepting this, whereas in other places that are more driven by capitalism, this impulse to claim economic gain is much stronger. The curse of development...","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Yea... that's pretty much where I float on this issue.  Maybe with some reservations on where you actually draw the line between a racial caricature and when it's just a racially specific equivalent of a cowboy, pirate, or viking (eg. I'd probably put 'geisha' in the same camp of acceptability as 'ninja'). You could probably fix a lot of the costumes with a simple name re-branding. An admittedly racist 'Indian' costume would infringe a lot less on the ethnic caricature territory if it was given a more meaningful name like 'Mohawk warrior' 'Apache raider' or 'Cherokee Hunter' or SOMETHING with a little more substance (assuming you don't get things blatantly inaccurate, or that those sub-categories aren't in themselves awkward hyperbolic caricatures like 'Comanche Scalper'). Who knows, such normalization might even get a basic cursory knowledge of what's what conveyed to the average layman.  I guess if I were to pick a rule of thumb, if it's worth the time, & money to spend on a costume, try to have at least the BASIC idea of what the cultural context actually is.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Actually Native Americans were mostly wiped out by diseases like smallpox (which was spread unbeknownst to the Europeans) , and the killing that did happens was mostly with the help of other Native American tribes. Before the Europeans got there there was a lot of war amongst the tribes. Furthermore, there was a decent amount of intermarrying between the society. However, that's not to say there weren't horrendous crimes committed against them, but so have white people.

I admit this perspective is probably influenced by the fact that I live in Mexico and thus I don't have to deal with being a minority, however I can understand that this behaviour is simply a joke, so I don't see why make such a big deal about it.

"This is really more of an aside, I think. But on the topic of open mockery (in reference to Halloween costumes), I'm just on a bit of a mental tangent. How familiar are you with Japan and modern Japanese culture? Because I'm a bit of a shinnichi (or Japanophile, if you prefer), and there's some really racist stuff that comes out of Japan. And I don't care, really.  White people and black people are both the brunt of tasteless jokes and stereotypes, and there's usually little outrage about it. Personally, I think a lot of it can be attributed to Japan being a pretty insulated and isolated culture... even just in terms of geography, which I think is a major factor. When I see things, that to Western eyes, are blatantly racist, I don't get angry and assume Japanese people are generally bigoted and spiteful. I don't get a high and mighty _Oh, they just don't know any better_ attitude either. Japan is just overwhelmingly populated by an ethnically similar populace, and that's reflected in their perception of the rest of the world. It's very different from the West... though the Trump crowd seems a bit inspired by the basic consept, I think.  Those white people, and their big, pointy faces...

"It's interesting that you took the approach of examining the attitude of one 'culture' to another rather that one 'individual' to a culture, given the countercultural trend to your vids so far. I mean, cultures are basically an attempt to assign the victories and faults of singular individuals to entire groups, largely based on uncontrollable and unrelated externals such as race or place of birth. Acting as a culture or even acknowledging culture as more than a sum of many individuals' choices seems to me to legitimize that mindset, which skirts dangerously close to corporatism. I mean sure, there's a lot of abstract connotation behind what people wear/eat/repeat, but the idea that those abstracts are fixed to specific arrangements of matter outside of the dictation of the individual - that a person cannot have their own language outside of that spoken by others - substitutes free thought for a prescriptive conservation of formal ideas.  Let's say that every aspect of culture falls within the realm of communication, transferring ideas by way of symbols. It's easy to argue that effective communication can only result from the speaker's conformity to the lexicon of the listener. In other words, cultural identifiers have to be tied to the external world. I think most of the time the debate around cultural appropriation assumes this is true, and that what is being communicated by a person by their dress/mannerisms is in keeping either with the lexicon of their own culture or a language more universally human (smiling, shaking a weapon, yelling). This is the case for both groups you highlight, those who deliberately mock cultures by perverting their symbols and those who assimilate (appropriate?) symbols of cultures they admire. In both cases, the external system of reference is active and predominate.  But I don't think most people use symbols like this at all. Exactly like language, the bulk of symbolism is an individual's attempt to consistently communicate ideas to themselves outside of any external meaning. The purpose of abstracts - of language - is rooted in thinking first, and only then communicating thought. We wear clothes we personally associate with our valued aesthetics of what we perceive, largely without the abstract references others tie to such symbols. We collect trinkets symbolically linked to our memories, the most intimately personal and incommunicable parts of our experiences. It doesn't matter what their value is to any culture but that of the chain-gang of flesh and thought we call an 'individual'.  I hope that makes sense to you, I'd struggle to make it any clearer. Viewing individuals as cultures is largely what's caused this mess. I'm not convinced that there's any way to end it while simultaneously acknowledging a presiding 'cultural identity'.  Thanks for all the great vids, they're very well thought out and endlessly entertaining. I hope you get to make many more.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Alot of people here in Trinidad where I live take growing dreads very seriously since its a very time consuming thing with washing and oiling the scalp so you don't get flakes in your hair. I've spent many a Sunday wringing out my Grandmothers hair for hours.  Rastafarianism isn't a big thing outside Jamaica and here in Trinidad we only have a small sect of Rastafarianism call the Bo-boshanties;they only live off the land and can only make money off of things they make themselves.  I've only ever seen non-black people with matted hair calling it dreads in the US or from tourists who vacation here to 'find themselves'.  And I think you're confusing the Hindu Jata with dreads,its a common misconception so I understand.I see alot of Hindu monks with it anytime I frequent the beach.

Now I don't think I'd ever want to where a generic Native American to a halloween party, but what if I wanted to go as a character such as Nightwolf from Mortal Kombat, or similar?  The character isn't the most original design, but I think he looks pretty cool and I wouldn't want to not go as him because he's Native American as that seems like racist reasoning.  I use Nightwolf as an example of a Native American as that's the group that seems to have the most furore regarding Halloween costumes at the moment, but in Mortal Kombat specifically I've scene depictions of Raiden be criticised for being a white guy rather than Japanese.  However, Raiden as a character of Mortal Kombat isn't Japanese, he's a god who takes the form of a human in clothing that's typical of East Asian styles, including a conal hat.  His name is even officially pronounced 'Ray-Den' rather than the correct 'R-eye-Den'.  So if I was going to a party as him would people be upset at me for being white?
