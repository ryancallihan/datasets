"I'm digging the minor ninth between the bass-line (Solfege: me) and the melody (mi) in the outro music.  It really effectively propels the piece given the less dissonant major ninth (do and re) hear shortly thereafter before resolving stepwise to an octave (do's).  Very nice work.  Suggestion: the piece is very nearly bitonal, which has kind of a nice ring given the accompanying subject material.  Instead of treating the le in the bass as a root position bVI triad with the re in the melody as a passing tone, it might be more effective to treat the le as part of a second inversion iio/ (half-diminished seventh chord).  That way, mi can be heard as an appoggiatura resolving to the root.  Practically, then, it makes sense to treat the bVII like a dominant chord by adding the chordal #11 (mi).  This keeps the tension building and allows for rare moments of unity to stand out that much more.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I found this interesting :) So, I'm not a trender? I have gender dysphoria, I am an FTM (not a tumblr gender), I hate my female body and want it to be male more than anything in the world, and I hate it when people refer to me as female and I want them to refer to me as male. I wear and do feminine things, but I don't wear dresses or anything like that because they give me dysphoria, I still want to have masculine features even though I'm fairly femme. I go to a Gender Identity Clinic and I experience very rough dysphoria. I'll describe my appearance: I have short hair with shaved sides, I have glasses, I wear a black crop top, I have black painted nails, I have a slim, muscular physique, I wear skinny jeans and sneakers. I also wear a little bit of makeup occasionally, my appearance made me worry that I was a transtrender. So, you can see that I look fairly feminine but I also look masculine, too. I shouldn't care about what other people think, but it's really hard not to.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"2 genders - plus 'neither' and 'both.' That's my opinion on the matter. It can all boil down relatively simple from there. Sort of like with sexuality there can be some level of specification within these 4 main groups but given gender is an identification separate from but relative to sexual 'equipment' as a decidedly human concept (so far) and there's only two biologically feasible parts and the possibility of having 'neither' in some rare cases or 'both' in other rare cases, makes me feel confident that allowing for agender and nonbinary individuals and grouping other 'third' genders within these four main groups.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"honestly, the person i agree with most is the transsexual. Femininity/masculinity is a social construct but gender isn't. Thats why trans people exist, the gender in the brain does not correspond with their sex, and because of this disconnect trans individuals experience gender dysphoria. I'm not angry at people that are confused, but at those that make them confused.I think we should stop gloryfying being trans, which leads to people actually wanting to be trans and making up some mogai bullshit. Gender dysphoria is a medical condition, just like many others and it's not gatekeeping to say that if you dont experience dysphoria you are not trans. That's like explaining to those edgy 14 year olds that if you dont show any signs of depression, u dont have depression. While yes, people do assume trans people are trenders simply because of their expression (and THAT is gatekeeping), and do push it a bit too far that if you do certain things youre a trender, and I think that is harmful too. But not as harmful as glorifying being trans, saying u dont need dysphoria to be trans, confusing people into thinking theyre trans, and creating more and more detransitioners, terfs, transphobes, or even push people to commiting suicide. It backfires, and does more harm than any good to the trans community. I think we shiuld cut out all this philosophy about gender and maing it simple. Because, if you cant explain something in a simple way, that means u dont quite understand it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"as an out and out nonbinary person i've decided to switch my label to baltimore-gender after watching this video.  also while i'm here! i do wish this video had touched on gender euphoria. it's something a lot of trans people don't realize that they even experience !! it's ... literally the validation that comes from being correctly gendered. that happy feeling you get when you pass in public, when your waitress calls you 'ma'am', or when you get a casual 'hey girl' from a stranger. and i feel like gender euphoria is cool to know about because being trans isn't about hating yourself every second of every day. it *can* be validating and comforting, despite how badly dysphoria hurts.   and of course plenty of nonbinary people experience dysphoria as well! and do want to medically transition! my partner's cousin mav took an 'androgynizing' dose of hormones, and i'd like to do the same. i'm afab, so i'd like to go on T at some point. and the concept of 'presenting as nonbinary/genderqueer/whatever'--it's exactly like you explained! it can be as simple as stating your gender, or lack thereof, as fact, or it can be performative, just like it can be for binary trans people. for me, i do want top surgery and for my voice to drop, but i still want longish hair and a round face and no facial hair. i do want that societal signal of confusion, but it's still okay if a person just wants to use they/them and that's it, that's their presentation.  anyways sorry for rambling and i know a lot of people might see this as weird, still. i get it, i'm a 19 year old nonbinary person who uses they/them pronouns and not everyone is going to be chill with a weird queer saying weird tumblr things and that's fine  which is why, as i said, i am now baltimore. and if you insult me i will materialize out of the faint swirls of dust swimming in the dim light of your room and pour glitter in your bed so that it becomes rather uncomfortable to sleep and wherein you will continually roll around and get glitter in unflattering areas as a reminder of the fact that it costs $0 to stay in your lane","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Originally I was gonna begin this by disagreeing with you, but rather I want to first say the things I agree with you on.   I agree that we shouldn't be assholes to people for no reason. Being mean and insulting others isn't the way to get people to agree with you, discussion is.  Now, discussion is best aided by facts, and this is where I bring up where we disagree. You see researches at stanford have already wondered about the differences in male and female brains. URL  First, on purely psychological differences, 'Women excel in several measures of verbal ability -- pretty much all of them, except for verbal analogies. Women's reading comprehension and writing ability consistently exceed that of men, on average. They outperform men in tests of fine-motor coordination and perceptual speed. They're more adept at retrieving information from long-term memory.  Men, on average, can more easily juggle items in working memory. They have superior visuospatial skills: They're better at visualizing what happens when a complicated two- or three-dimensional shape is rotated in space, at correctly determining angles from the horizontal, at tracking moving objects and at aiming projectiles.  Navigation studies in both humans and rats show that females of both species tend to rely on landmarks, while males more typically rely on 'dead reckoning': calculating one's position by estimating the direction and distance traveled rather than using landmarks.' Straight from the mouths of the researches themselves, literally copy-pasted for better measure rather than quoting from memory.   Now on to actual physical differences, 'The neuroscience literature shows that the human brain is a sex-typed organ with distinct anatomical differences in neural structures and accompanying physiological differences in function, says UC-Irvine professor of neurobiology and behavior Larry Cahill, PhD. Cahill edited the 70-article January/February 2017 issue of the Journal of Neuroscience Research -- the first-ever issue of any neuroscience journal devoted entirely to the influence of sex differences on nervous-system function.  Brain-imaging studies indicate that these differences extend well beyond the strictly reproductive domain, Cahill says. Adjusted for total brain size (men's are bigger), a woman's hippocampus, critical to learning and memorization, is larger than a man's and works differently. Conversely, a man's amygdala, associated with the experiencing of emotions and the recollection of such experiences, is bigger than a woman's. It, too, works differently, as Cahill's research has demonstrated.  In 2000, Cahill scanned the brains of men and women viewing either highly aversive films or emotionally neutral ones. The aversive films were expected to trip off strong negative emotions and concomitant imprinting in the amygdala, an almond-shaped structure found in each brain hemisphere. Activity in the amygdala during the viewing experience, as expected, predicted subjects' later ability to recall the viewed clips. But in women, this relationship was observed only in the left amygdala. In men, it was only in the right amygdala. Cahill and others have since confirmed these results.  Discoveries like this one should ring researchers' alarm buzzers. Women, it's known, retain stronger, more vivid memories of emotional events than men do. They recall emotional memories more quickly, and the ones they recall are richer and more intense. If, as is likely, the amygdala figures into depression or anxiety, any failure to separately analyze men's and women's brains to understand their different susceptibilities to either syndrome would be as self-defeating as not knowing left from right.  The two hemispheres of a woman's brain talk to each other more than a man's do. In a 2014 study, University of Pennsylvania researchers imaged the brains of 428 male and 521 female youths -- an uncharacteristically huge sample -- and found that the females' brains consistently showed more strongly coordinated activity between hemispheres, while the males' brain activity was more tightly coordinated within local brain regions. This finding, a confirmation of results in smaller studies published earlier, tracks closely with others' observations that the corpus callosum--- the white-matter cable that crosses and connects the hemispheres -- is bigger in women than in men and that women's brains tend to be more bilaterally symmetrical than men's.'  There's a ton more interesting stuff like that. However, I'm also one to know that there's no one size fits all human body. Whew biology is a fuck and the human mind is a bigger fuck because it doesn't even need a reason sometimes to just do what it wants. Aided again by our wonderful researchers! 'A 2017 study in JAMA Psychiatry imaged the brains of 98 individuals ages 8 to 22 with autism spectrum disorder and 98 control subjects. Both groups contained roughly equal numbers of male and female subjects. The study confirmed earlier research showing that the pattern of variation in the thickness of the brain's cortex differed between males and females. But the great majority of female subjects with ASD, the researchers found, had cortical-thickness variation profiles similar to those of typical non-ASD males.  In other words, having a typical male brain structure, whether you're a boy or a girl, is a substantial risk factor for ASD. By definition, more boys' than girls' brains have this profile, possibly helping explain ASD's four- to fivefold preponderance among boys compared with girls.'   And furtherly, 'Infant girls respond more readily to faces and begin talking earlier. Boys react earlier in infancy to experimentally induced perceptual discrepancies in their visual environment. In adulthood, women remain more oriented to faces, men to things.  All these measured differences are averages derived from pooling widely varying individual results. While statistically significant, the differences tend not to be gigantic. They are most noticeable at the extremes of a bell curve, rather than in the middle, where most people cluster. Some argue that we may safely ignore them.  But the long list of behavioral tendencies in which male-female ratios are unbalanced extends to cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders. Women are twice as likely as men to experience clinical depression in their lifetimes; likewise for post-traumatic stress disorder. Men are twice as likely to become alcoholic or drug-dependent, and 40 percent more likely to develop schizophrenia. Boys' dyslexia rate is perhaps 10 times that of girls, and they're four or five times as likely to get a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.'   Now on like nonbinary folk I am skeptical but I can not only understand the feeling somewhat but see more than one way it could come about.   'Gerber Dysphoria'  is caused by the brain being the shape of the opposite sex, which then could lead to a more severe form of the brain being perfectly in the middle, or somewhere within a spectrum.   Thing about human biology is it loves its sliding scales. There's patterns everywhere in humans  displaying this, so who's to say gender dysphoria couldn't be something that exists on one too?  And I don't know about others but I try to be nice unless slighted because who wants all that negativity?   I can already tell we may disagree on a lot, but that's all the better saying that it'd be a shame to pass up the opportunity to listen to someone who disagrees with you put up a good point.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Explaining gender based on identity works because it challenges human-made and upheld social constructs, that is to say, something made up and not existing in nature, whereas species is a definite biological fact.

"I hate to make this about me but I feel like my personal experience will help enlighten people. I was born with an X and Y chromosome and a matching purse and jewels. When I was a child I used my mother's makeup walked around the house with her heels, pretended to wear dresses, acted and walked feminine, preferred dolls over race cars and action figures, hated sports and liked boys. Every man in my life and most women expressed very stereotypical opinions to this 'man up' 'stop acting like a girl' 'boys shouldn't do that' 'if you were my son I'd beat you right'. Now at age 19 I am proud to say I survived this abuse with only moderately severe psychiatric issues. Because of what all those people told me about what I was and wasn't supposed to do because my outward appearance put me into a box in their mind, I now refuse to claim the title of Man or Boy. I don't want to act like a man and never have, and if other people want to tell me I'm not acting like a man then I'm not going to bother correcting them, I'll just agree and say that I am Non-Binary.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I was thinking Justine's poor understanding of Butler's theory was reflective of the author's own, but that line from the freedom report woman (whatever her name is) 'As a biological female...' thoroughly rejects that notion. Natalie Wynn (aka Contrapoints) is, as we know from all her videos documenting the process, NOT a biological female (which is to say, she was not assigned female at birth). But we, the audience, based on the given text MUST accept the character as such, even if there is not even a great difference between her and the others 'on stage'; there is not a noticeable difference between the trans characters and cis characters: which is to say that, within the realm of performance, there is no difference at all.

So the claim about feeling you're a man or woman when assigned female or male at birth is far more plausible given that we know sexually dimorphic traits occur in various possible combinations, while Norwegian Forest Cat traits mostly just don't occur in those born to human parents.  Why is the helicopter argument still being considered anywhere other than breitbart?  Ugh.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The argument that you clearly miss, Contra - what's controversial about trans movement demands among more liberal-minded people (as opposed to dyed-in-the-wool social conservatives) isn't the idea that individuals have the right to their own gender presentation (no matter how normative or freaky), but that 1) other people owe trans and gender nonconforming folks total validation, even to the point where a demand is placed on them to not have genitally-based sexual preferences - this ignores the fact that those people have their own autonomy and needs that deserve respect as well; and 2) that  trans and queer ideologues practice a kind of essentialism - they build small differences and preferences up into reified identities - 'genderqueer', 'demisexual', etc, rather than just allow them to be part of a broad range of individual quirks and preferences that one can ask the larger world to learn to respect or at least tolerate. Also, there's a lack of historical perspective here - current concepts and self-identities of gay, queer, etc are very different from a generation ago, and will probably be very different a generation from now - maybe many of these things are just passing trends.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You know, for a while, I admittedly had so much trouble understanding or accepting examples of divergence from cisnormativity that didn't necessarily involve diagnosed dysphoria, and only recently decided that, instead of being a dismissive jerk about it, it wouldn't hurt to just let it be, for similar reasons as to why I go out of my way to not be a jerk to people just for being religious. This helped me understand so much better why there's some real legitimacy to this concept beyond that framing, during a time I was still trying to figure out if this was indeed a legitimate thing. Indeed, it was probably largely through my own family experiences that I was even fortunate enough to accept transgendered people at an earlier age than many other cis folks in my generation may have. I'm very thankful that this video exists, if only because it helped me learn how to be more accepting of something I was still trying to learn to accept, instead of shun and mock.

"Like all values and identities at their foundation, aren't the very concepts of validity and gender arbitrary? In order to convince someone of arbitrary things, they must be shown to conform somehow to that persons own arbitrary conceptions, otherwise it takes the much more difficult task of impressing a foreign concept without any obvious framework into a mind which has become accustomed to thinking in frameworks.  It's much easier to convince people that something is normal if it's framed as within a normal category, or like another normal thing. Likewise it's almost impossible to teach most people whole new concepts, especially after about age 22.  It seems like the real problem is that the categories we live with have degraded into a problematic obsolescence. How can we repurpose the concepts of gender and validity to get the fuck out of the way, or ditch them entirely?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

If you have your social groups where people are comfortable in speaking to you like that. Great! Glad that makes you happy, but why do i need to conform to that as well? Why is it bad for me to speak to a person with either he or she, when my first instinct would be for either one. There shouldn't be that much weight to it in my opinion. You already feel disconnected from either pronoun so why is it that me saying he or she than is incorrect?   Then what i have come up with in my own hours under the shower trying to understand is the following. There are certain stereotypes associated with being a he or she, and for someone to then be spoken to as he/she whilst feeling a disassociation with that pronoun can be triggering, as it doesn't confine with what they have made their own box (in this case being they/them boxes). So if that would be the case, would it then not be easier for a society as a whole to keep he and she and have (arguably) the minority redefine what it means to them personally to be he or she?  I.E. I might call a person who would identify as they/them, he. Instead of that person telling me that he wants to be called they, that person has 'reprogrammed' himself to take that 'he' as a fluid. A case of: Give words less power, instead of more words more power.  Closing statement. Great video, I'm going to be honest and say that i don't watch every video, but every video i do watch i enjoy watching. Hopefully someone can make me understand, and if not i hope i gave some people a different angle to view things from.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I do resonate with both characters, but I do want to offer my two cents. I understand why some trans people cling to the medical diagnosis. It does make things a lot easier to explain to others and helps to give them something to research and learn from.  A case of 'I have this 'wrong' with me and it is backed by medical science. There is a treatment and I am doing this because it is the best course of treatment for me.'  I'm a heavily closeted trans man and I'm going to see a therapist. My parents are both very conservative, but open minded. And so I'm hoping by 'showing' that I have the medical diagnosis that it will ease the strain. Show that while the condition 'is in my head', but I'm not absolutely delusional. Because they have made all kinds of comments about trans and non binary people and it makes me nervous.  Also I can respond to the question of the doctors looking at my brain with a yes. I have a copy of my MRI that I took about a year ago. They can see my male brain that has scars.

The biggest one that comes to mind, aside from incompatible personal philosophies of the creator( please don't be mad, this is just an observation), is the lack of knowledge  regarding the differences between male and female brains. Topics such as size, weight, neural densities/connections and active areas are ripe for discussion as well as thought process hierarchies. Without any mention of these (granted it would put most people to sleep) I can't agree that that avenue of legitimization is invalid. Empirical data does not require the observer have similar values/beliefs/ experiences as you., and thus is a powerful tool in convincing  someone.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Whats amusing is that Contrapoints makes points that are largely gender critical. Its true that trans medicalism is a trend. Its true that people claiming to have wrong body brain shiz do not have any test to prove it. And its true that the only real argument for accepting of peoples identities as valid is empathy and compassion. Which then suggests we should have compassion for all people - including what CP would call cis women. So on this basis Laurel Hubbard should not be competeing against women in the Olmpic weightlifiting because Hubbard will always win due to male biology and hence superior strength than females half their age. CP also lets the cat out the bag that gender ideology is not rational or logical - it is basically a religion.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"My understanding of the conclusion of the video is that not only should society accept transpeople with gender dysphoria, but also extremely non traditional identities, such as otherkin, or even further, identifying as a city. If my understanding is correct, this is very 'problematic', for lack of a better word.  I agree with the acceptance of transpeople, given there is a legitimate medical diagnosis behind it (although I disagree with a lot of the language and theories that are being put forward), but forcing society to accept any identity regardless of how ludicrous, especially through discrimination laws, is a disaster waiting to happen. It's the 'I identify as an attack helicopter' argument, except sincere (Poe's Law).  The more you try and force people to dispense with rationality in a dogmatic pursuit of acceptance, the more people will resent being anathematized and controlled. This strikes me as a move away from one religion and right into another, secular religion. Disagreement will be viewed as heresy and blasphemy, and true to form, will result in excommunication from polite society. This is immoral, as rational ethical people can come to reject the idea that a person can be a cat and castigating large swaths of otherwise moral people as evil is immoral in itself. Its analogous to the way many Christians and others treat Muslims.  Not only is it immoral, it seems ultimately self-defeating. The more the dogmatic exert control over the population, the more the controlled fight back. Look to modern social justice movements or historical overthrows of dictatorships as examples. I am sure I will get a bunch of hate for this, but it seems like the obvious truth to me.

"trans trenders only really exist with ftm, usually teens to young adults. I've noticed a pattern and trend, one that i'm part of (went through this same period of my life) and honestly it seems to be a lot of girls hating their bodies so extensively due to sexual assault/rape that they can't see themselves as women anymore.   I just kinda can't see me as 'me' anymore so I've opted to make a new persona entirely both in personality and visibly and it's helped considerably to just...abandon everything else but i'm still kinda dead inside.   Let everyone explore themselves is my bottom line message: If I had been born in the time where 'transtrender' was a term I think I would've never found my personal solution for not wanting to kill myself over my body.   Obviously this doesn't apply to everyone but I have noticed a pattern amongst friends and acquaintances who became part of this 'trend' and 'grew out of' it for lack of better terms. So like seriously? Let people figure themselves out.    I think you'd have to have a death wish outside of internalized self-loathing to be a mtf trans for 'fun' cause it is vastly more unsafe if you're pre-transition or don't plan to transition fully.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think it's important to note that there are trans people out there that want everyone to know they're trans and that wear it kind of a fashion statement (which doesn't make them any less trans) but there are also trans people out there that just want to transition and never have anyone know or have it be important to their life. The media only wants it to be one way or the other because they can't seem to wrap their heads around the fact that every single trans person is different and has their own personality and way of seeing themselves. So, really, the only way to fix this is more actual trans representation in the media and not just one trans character written by a cis person and played by a cis person. But multiple trans characters each with their own storylines that go deeper than them being trans and have them be written and played by trans people, or at least be written by people who interviewed and talked to trans people","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I kind of relate to this. I totally support everyone including non-binary people no matter how they identify or how extreme their gender expression may seem to me. But at the same time I can't help feeling weird when exposed to an abstract vague depiction of gender. I guess it makes me kind of dysphoric because even though I'm trans I'm extremely binary I feel my male identity  very strongly but I can't  explain why. If you strip away society's ideas of gender and say that nothing is gendered then how do I validate and express myself. For example I started testosterone and enjoy growing a beard because it makes me feel like a 'real man' but I know damn well that you can be a man with out a bread and  women or non-binary people who choose to rock a beard have every right to do so and I support that very much. So what do I have that's solely male that I can embrace as part of my identity. As you can see  it's not a problem with them it's a problem with me I can't imagine being anything other than a man or a woman. like when I try to imagine that blind people don't see black darkness because they don't see all and what that would be like. or if I try to imagine what it would be like to not exist like if that's what death is. It's a strong sense of existential dread. If that's how some cis people feel when discussing any trans issues then I guess I understand why they would lash out. On the topic of trans trending, I would never judge someone or treat them differently because of it but there are times when I see someone expressing what appears to be a very superficial idea of gender like it's a fashion statement some sort of fun game, saying they don't need dysphoria to be trans and stuff. it just feels a little  disrespectful because it's very serious to a lot of people and not some light-hearted choice.  But still no matter these internal feelings that arise and I can't really control I'm not judging anyone based on how they feel about gender or how they choose to express that gender. Sometimes the liberal left gets a little overbearing I wish you could express honest feelings like this stating that it's just a fact about how I feel and it's not meant as an attack without it always being twisted to be something insulting. I respect these people but I admit that the concept baffles me and the two are not mutually exclusive. the point is  feeling this way is not an excuse to be an asshole.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You're amazing! I too think that people don't need to have logical reasons to feel or be a certain way. The argument about gay people not having to logically explain why they are gay really hit close to home. I am Polish, living in Poland, an extremely homophobic country. The whole politics right now is built around the majority party using 'the gay problem' to scare Poles into voting for them. As homosexuals are being shown as the greatest evil (literally, it's disgusting and shocking what the majority party is saying about them), the small portion of the Left that is, well... left  (lol)in Poland (none of them in the parliament...) is beating their brains out trying to find logical, rational, scientific arguments for why being gay is both natural and non-theatening. That's why I was a little taken aback when the character said that gay people don't have to explain why they are that way, they simply are. Now, I do realise gay people in the USA still experience homophobia in various shape and form, but I can see how being gay is more generally accepted there (even the right has their own gay representatives like the infamous Milo) and not oficially said to be a threat to the safety of the country.  I know, it's become a rant about polish politics lol...... But what I mean is, transgender ppl there are kind of treated like gay ppl  here in that they must PROVE their existence, rather than simply be believed.

"Oh GAWD, what am I? I'm so confused.... nought.  My gender is NOT defined by my genitals, it is defined by those meta-things we call feelings and thoughts.  I first experienced gender dysphoria at the age of nine; it was 1969 and there was nowhere for me to turn to. a few years later Renae Richards was being talked about on TV as one who transitioned from male to female and I literally thought that there is still hope for me. Here I am half a fucking century later and question the cisnormative treatment that is gender-confirming surgery which focuses primarily on cosmetic surgery of one's genitals and potentially destroying one's ability at sexual pleasure, but, and this is a big but, not a booty butt, but a but-but, lol, it does nothing for helping one fit into society. When people are walking down the street and see another person, they do not decide on the sex of that person by looking at the genitals or sniffing each other's butts. Sexuality is determined by how your facial features have developed due to the dominant hormones in your body. I see so many trans people who have transitioned and I can clock them because the transition took place late in life and birth hormones(mostly testosterone) has left its mark with a more pronounced brow, a stronger chin etc etc. For women transitioning into men, I do not believe it is as powerful as the testosterone replacement therapy will change their features and their voice. Not so for M2F transfolk whose only answer is facial feminization surgery. which is not covered in Canada. But mutilating my genitalia is. Let's be real here, gender confirmation surgery is cosmetic surgery of the genitalia and if it works for you, all the power to you, but it doesn't work for me. I do not define myself by my genitalia, I define myself by those amorphous nonphysical attributes called thoughts and feelings.    My genitals are my business. My gender reflects how I wish to interact with the rest of society. In some ways, I see myself as hermaphroditic, not in the true sense of the word, but in the sense that my gender is of one sex while my genitalia is of another.   EVERYTHING IS A SPECTRUM. SO BE A RAINBOW. NOT A SINGLE SHADE OF A RAINBOW, BUT THE WHOLE GLORIOUS RAINBOW","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The way you phrased Tiffany's willingness to attack other trans women and enbies out feelings of insecurities definitely hit home.  Society doesn't view lesbianism as as valid as heterosexually and women are always seen to be able to be converted by men. I think this notion has made me feel insecure in my gayness and made feel resentful of anyone who is attracted to women also feeling the same towards men. I know realise how small and asinine this behaviour is and that it is my problem, not that of unsuspecting bisexuals. Natalie works wonders","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"First of all I love this video, I'm cisgender myself so I'm going to be very careful about saying this, but to me it seems like the only valid trans identities are the ones that come with dysphoria. That of course included MTF, FTM, non binary (which includes gender neutral, gender fluid, a-gender, and also those who are non binary but lean closer to one side of the spectrum than to the other) I think all gender identities are valid as long as they have dysphoria and stay within the confines of being human. (So not attack helicopters) that's just my cis opinion, that being said if a person who had no dysphoria asked me to call them 'they' or 'she' or 'he', despite what they look like I would call them that without hesitation because respect is more important than my opinion.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

You can either make a decision to improve yourself in order to get more or to STEAL from other, like with taxes.

Isn't a manly gay guy who only craves purely masculine traits in a mate a true, pure male, since he wants nothing to do with femininity in any form? So isn't the manliest man on earth a gay guy who's only attracted to other extremely manly gay guys? Which means, isn't everyone just on a giant sliding scale of gender and sexual attraction? If you really dig down, cis hetero people are gross and weird too, since they're all basically all trying to date their mom or dad in the end.

"Ok... but there is psychological and biological proof for the existence of trans people. Trans trending theory is dangerous to trans people. You also shouldn't knock people for trying to help others understand things with science. It's the best chance we have for acceptance. That being said non binary people are valid. Bodily autonomy should be recognized as a human right. Everything anyone can think of, exists somewhere in creation and you can't destroy it. It just comes back. Like the bird that re-evolved. Like Jews. And even unfortunately like nazis. You can try to kill something out of existence but it continues on regardless in some form or another. The real issue is the quick acceptance of murder and destruction as a solution to any problem. If any of these god toting conservatives believes that that is how the world is, then destruction runs opposite of the nature of the world, ie. Creation. Last point, it's pretty clear that some trans people, terfs, etc anyone really are fucked by trauma when they become so defensive that it's evolutionary to others. It's probably just an ingrained survival instinct. Society is a gathering of people for our mutual survival and excluding people doesn't benefit anyone's survival. Acceptance is the key to humanity's continued existence (in this form) and survival","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Transtrenders exist, they are just the goths or emos or punks of this generation. The problem is that we've just given goths legal protections and that means when they act out (as goths do) they get a shield around them and it stops teachers being able to punish them appropriately (transtrender kids throwing books at teachers are let off, transtrender kids arguing with senior teachers that they get to wear whatever clothes they like, transtrender kids starting fires then saying it was because of transphobia, that sort of thing - and these examples are just from one school I was on placement). These kids will grow out of it, like almost all goths or punks do (you still see the occassional 50 year old with a safety clip earing in full denim), but whilest they are still teenagers it is a nightmare.   This is not to say 100% of kids who say they are trans in highschool don't turn out to be trans, but there is a definite group which are social malcontents, which would have been goth, who instead express their rejection of the norm by being 'trans.' Being trans is a protected characteristic and these trantrenders use it to their advantage, you can tell very quickly how they enjoy this status when you hear them speaking to teachers.

"'What makes nonbinary people nonbinary?'  Well for me, it's feeling like gender roles/restrictions/expectations have absolutely NO personal relevance to who I know myself to be / what I want to do. I don't notice and I don't care about noticing. But then again I'm probably more at the 'agender' end of the spectrum. I am a 'genders? no thanks' person.  Meanwhile, I have friends who enjoy & care passionately about being feminine AND being masculine, at their own pace, and identify as genderfluid. They are a 'genders? yes thank you' person. (Note: 'nonbinary' is an umbrella term that includes genderfluid, bigender, polygender, and similar identities)  The funny part is, we can both end up with similar appearances when it comes to gender performance, since we've both decided we're gonna do whatever the hell we want, when we want. We just have different reasons for doing so.  I'm not more valid for saying 'gender roles are made up' and they're not more valid for saying 'I am both feminine and masculine'. Neither of us are inherently more woke or valid than people who say 'I am a woman', 'I am a man', 'I am a gender-nonconforming woman', or 'I am a gender-nonconforming man'. Yes, all gender roles are made up. Yes, your femininity/masculinity is still real. It's not a contest. We are who we are, we don't have to prove anything to anyone. We're all stuck on this bitch of an earth and the least y'all could do is not make another person's day worse, if you can help it. That's it. It ain't rocket science.  In other words, I agree with the conclusion of this video.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Personally I don't believe that transgenderism derives from people not being comfortable with social constructs. You can be a feminine boy or a masculine girl   But transgenderism really does seem to derive from not being comfortable as a man or woman  And it would make sense chemically Because of testosterone vs estrogen, for a chemical imbalance at birth to be extremely plausible and at least be a strong factor in Gender Dysphoria  But that's just from an outsider's perspective.   I think writing wise it was a good idea to make Jackie non-binary after Boston being the only representation, since THEY obviously weren't a realistic representative, only part of a vocal minority who do really seem or are trying to push an agenda rather than actually feeling uncomfortable from  A. Unsure about transitioning B. Other explanations for all the non-binary stuff   Since Jackie is the true representative of the non-binary argument.    There's still a difference from being non binary and being 'star gender', because there's a point where people feel like they need to distance themselves from gender stereotypes by granting themselves an unnecessary new identity, and think they aren't a woman because they don't fit gender roles   When really they're irrelevant and we don't need labels to distance ourselves from those roles, we just need to understand that they don't fit everyone. Even if sometimes they might fit the Majority. chances are you're the minority in some hobby or part of you.   Not being in the majority, not fitting a stereotype, doesn't mean you aren't a part of that group.   But if you are physically uncomfortable with your body, with having a dick or vagina or facial hair- then you are non binary or transexual or whatever.   And if you're confused, so be it.   That's where I line up, I think.   I'm open to criticism and I haven't done a lot of research since I'm not super into getting on people's ass about their life and their business since I'm generally accepting of trans people. Even if before this video, I really didn't understand people's choices to be non-binary because I function more logically and rationally than emotionally.  This gave me insight and I'm very glad, since I have younger family members that have chosen to identify as non-binary. It's good to know that it might be their identity or simply confusion. I like to be able to understand and empathize.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"What makes something a gender vs. a personality trait?   I'm female, but I don't feel feminine or masculine; the way I act and dress is extremely neutral, yet I wouldn't even consider calling this an issue of gender, it seems way more like an aspect of personality.   This is why I feel more inclined to agree with Tiffany here. If you strongly identify with the opposite gender then go ahead and transition, but non-binary genders puzzle me. Just because you're called 'he/she' doesn't mean you have to perform a stereotypical gender role; moreover, I hardly think that the majority of people strongly identify with these stereotypical roles. Basically, I think wanting to be called 'they' is kinda extra.   Every 'they' I know is also an obnoxious mf so this might just be my bias speaking.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Honestly, I've been such a hardcore transmed and this really changed my views on that. The theory really isn't as clear cut as I thought I was and, ,,, not actually as important as I thought it was. If I met someone like 'Baltimore', I wouldn't want to argue them on their identity to police how they feel and yet I've been supporting an ideology that does exactly that. Hell, I don't even fit in with the 'typical' trans narrative. Growing up I fucking LOVED dressed and dolls and princesses, and once I hit puberty and bras and periods, 'womanhood' and having a 'woman's body' were things I had to deal with instead of just,, expressing how I like, I said 'fuck it' to all of it and identified as non-binary until I found that being a man is the most authentically me. Which kinda seems like a weird leap from where I started. But it makes sense to me, so.  I still have this need for 'words to have their meaning' though. When I say my pronouns are he/him I'm communicating that I'm a male and I don't want any ambiguity in that- but maybe thats really just a reflection of my own insecurities. Something I'm going to have to think on. Anyway, thank you for this Natalie.

"I love this channel, but to claim that you need to see a brain scan of a person's brain in order to diagnose them is to discredit the entire field of psychiatry. You don't need a brain scan to understand what's going on in the brain because psychiatrists look for symptoms of the phenomenon. For example, you don't need to examine the brain of someone with schizophrenia in order to conclude they have it, because schizophrenia has diagnosable symptoms. Brain scans are INCREDIBLY expensive, literally thousands upon thousands of dollars. The fact that transwomen are neurologically structured similarly to cisgender women simply means that there is a neurological basis for the psychological phenomenon of gender dysphoria, not that this neurological discovery is the only way to prove that someone is trans. I hate to say it but the point made by Baltimore that a nondysphoric trans person is as valid as a dysphoric trans person is fallacious and tumble's response of just saying 'there are scientific studies-' is a straw man of the general argument that you need dysphoria to be trans.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm cisgendered woman and I had a close friend who is transgender. She was just like Tiffany and because I wasn't trans and she was, I had no reason to not believe her views. She made sense to me and was really passionate about it, saying that the whole purpose of transition is because you don't associate with anything from your birth gender. I guess her frustrations came from the fact that she tried extremely hard to 'pass' and wanted zero trace of her birth gender to be recognizable while those she considered 'transtrenders' didn't care at all about 'passing.' Keep in mind we live in the US South so 'passing' is incredibly important here for most transgenders if they want any chance of living a normal life or not being seen as a 'circus freak.' I've been living in New York for a year now and have met nonbinary and transgenders without the same pressures that my friend felt living in the South. My views have obviously completely changed since I've been exposed to more transgender people and I feel guilty about thinking like Tiffany in the past because that friend was so bitter. It doesn't make her a bad person, it just makes her another victim of the South's oppressive environment.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I have two problems with this.   First. Just because a trans person says 'so yeah I'm only trans because I have a male body but a female brain and trans trenders are only trying to capitalize off our conditions for oppression points' doesn't mean that they are trying to conform so badly that they invalidate trenders and have internalized transphobia. What they are saying is valid because it's true most trans trenders are teens going through a phase and not actual trans people sorting things out. Most trans people already know how they are because their brain never matched their body for most of their lives. I rather have most trans trenders called out on their shit and hurt a few actual trans people than to make all real trans people suffer because these trenders are putting out a bad name for real trans people which can result in less available medical care because the vast majority of the population don't believe in the cause because of trans trenders confusing what it is to be trans. See there are levels to this sort of thing. Blair white/Tiffany for example is the definition of a 'pick me trans' she loves to rides any 'right wing' dick with her facts and logic. Although Kelvin Garrah agrees with her and uses the facts/logic route to justify his transgenderism he seems to be more moderate to liberal and doesn't seem as eager and desperate to conform with conservatives/right wing/republicans which makes him less likely to have internalized transphobia. I think you are making the Tiffiany character too 'pick me' for trans people who uses the 'different body for different brain' logic to justify their existence because not all trans people who use that argument are desperate conformers like Blair some are completely rational.   Second. If you can provide proof that the medical aspect of transsexuals are invalid then you have you a solid argument for gender non conformists and trans trenders. If trans people need to have gender dysphoria to be trans then there is no argument or philosophical theory that can support trans trenders (who aren't actual trans people figuring things out) or gender non conformists.   There should always be a difference in people who are who they are because they have a mental disorder and people who are who they are because they want to be.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Amazing video - I have to admit I've had trouble wrapping my head around the arguments you posed.  Perhaps because I'm a cis-het male who's never wrestled with my gender identity - I've been fortunate enough to never have to do the deep-dive into what is gender you have outlined throughout your videos.  The 'conventional definition' has been good enough for me to couch my sense of gender identity. As a scientist, I find the hardest part of answering a question is in defining the question - especially a concept that is a human construct based on a thought or sensation (like what is music, what is blue or what is salty).  Concepts need a hard definition to resolve debate (e.g. when is noon, or which direction is North) and so far Webster's dictionary and Medicine are still struggling to generate a solid consensus, especially in light of the evolving discussions on gender and genderqueer legislation.  In the meantime, I guess we have the definition of gender you pose in the video being a superposition of physical, psychological, and social qualities - and we base the metric by having many examples we can point to as 'typical' and 'demonstrative'.  But that can also affirm the idea that gender can be a bimodal distribution, and a fraction of us simply do not fit within 2 standard deviations into one of the two 'classical' gender roles.  I wish it was easy to define, it might save a lot of people grief in their search for validation in their sense of identity.  Finally, I think it is also interesting you note that the value in identifying one's gender is to decide how to properly interact with them.  Do I say 'sir' or 'madam', or how I look at them or talk to them in a meaningful and socially appropriate way?  Or do I really need to identify one's gender at all to recognize that this person still at least has rights under the law and feeling that can be hurt?  Is it even practical to have gender (or race) in a 'woke' society?  Definitely an interesting thought.  Thanks again for your video - it continues to challenge me (in a good way).  And sorry for the attempted dissertation in your comments section, I hope it makes a bit of sense in it's brevity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"some really deep quotes that I love: - 'Do you think you can purchase acceptance through conformity? Because that is not freedom, Tiffany Tumbles. That is simply adding another cell to the prison.'  - 'I pity you because you don't think that you're real until a man in a lab-coat signs a prescription pad. And I can't imagine what it must be like to have so little confidence in your own reality' - ' Tiffany there is nothing more sad and pathetic and desperate and low in this world than a tran who thinks she's better than other trans. It's like a drunk feeling superior to a junkie. You seem to think that you're queen of the world because you're hanging onto societal acceptance by two fingers instead of one. Well you're not bitch. You're just an insecure, frightened little queer who's determined to use the one ounce of power you have to tread other people down. And if I'm being honest, I don't find that very admirable.' - 'The fact that you project your dysphoria onto other people is your problem and your problem alone.' - 'But stigma you perpetuate against gender confusion and experimentation keeps trans people in the closet and delays transition, it alienates baby trans from the community that should be welcoming them instead of publicly humiliating them. And when you appoint yourself the public decider of whomst is really trans, the Torquemada of the trender inquisition, you're terrorizing a lot of people who are genuinely trying to figure themselves out.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I find this discussion of 'gender is either a performance OR biology OR a feeling OR....' super pointless, because, obviously, none of those models can really explain gender.

"I hope you do another episode with Baltimore but maybe include a less extravagant enby to help break some stereotypes. Maybe just an enby who presents in a typically feminine way or something. I feel like it's those who do present in ways that align with binary expectations that are often ridiculed or invalidated. So it'd be good to have Baltimore interact with another enby in a later video just to normalise things. Even if the character isn't introduced specifically because they're an enby.

I'll often argue with terfs online and I felt the sheer existence of non binary people encouraged their transphobic view of dysphoria being made up and the whole things a convoluted sexual assault ploy. I'm also worried about a likely increase in detransitioning cases popping up and I'm bored of still hearing the same old 'well I identify as' joke. All these points were brought up in the video. But after hearing the existence of non binary people allows for uncertain trans people a space in society to find themselves and should in time help trans acceptance, I feel like a dick. Though I do wish the name 'non binary' was changed as the name itself is an argument which is why so many people go off on one when someone simply says they are non binary. Queer works so much better.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I don't think that the theory about gender being a performance necessarily excludes trans people who don't pass. Well they are excluded technically but don't have to be excluded socially. Even if they're technically not the gender they want to be we can still, just for the sake of being nice, use their preferred pronoun and treat them like their preferred gender. However we define gender we can still treat people however we want, we don't have to follow our definition as if it's a law telling us how to treat people.  Also as for men playing women on stages, I would say that if they advertise them self as a crossdresser then they're still 100% male, because the whole premise of a crossdresser is that they are male and everyone in the audience is thinking of that person as male. But if they just advertise them self as a woman then I'd say that, temporarily, in that moment, they are a woman. That seems to make sense to me, but I'm not trans or anything so I'm just spitballing the things I've thought about purely because I find it interesting","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Jackie Jackson is definitely a more intelligent and way better dressed female version of Dave Rubin. I need more Freedom Report now! <3   PS: I'm not convinced that you need to look into people's brain in order to know that something is wrong with it. As a side note anecdote, I'm chronically depressed and have attention deficit disorder, and I never had to take a brain scan for this, however I did take a battery of psychometric tests and spent a time under 2 different psychiatrist (concomitantly) and a psychologist until they arrived on a consensus. It's indirect evidence, and sometimes this is close enough to justify the diagnosis, especially when the doctors keep the patient under observation after prescribing medicines to see if the medicines are functioning properly due to the correct diagnosis (this is vital on depression, for example, as the wrong medicine can increase suicidal ideation). Personally, I never felt sad, and would never guess I'm depressed before the event that made me look for medical help (panic syndrome after a turbulent relationship), as I believed that depression was utter sadness... I always looked at the world with complete apathy and disconnectedness, not sadness. I guess this is why I have always been interested in radical politics, because they are about belonging and not being. Being wasn't something I cared, and to be honest I don't know if I really care about it even now that I'm under treatment for 7 years, or if I'm just more adapted and biologically able to deal with it heuristically. I think that, in a lot of ways, this characteristic of mine makes me uncomfortable or aggressive towards identity politics and movements about being. Thus, I gravitate towards Tiffany Tumbles. I just happen to believe that she wasn't as prepared as Baltimore Maryland to defend her points. However, you gave a LOT to think about, Natalie.

"These arguments are pointless, either you have a NEED to be something else or you don't. Trannies who not conform to the ideals of the host society do not wish to be part of that society. Why would I say that? Well there are rules in place to make sure that members of those societies maintain birthing rates which is something that will diminish over time as more people focus on themselves vs the society at large. Societies crumble when many individuals believe they are above the society in which they reside. Honestly I hate having to say this but we need to focus on the continuation of the human race first and individual DESIRES second, at least until we advance our tech to the point when survival and rebirth are out of the hands of human individuals. Does this sound terrible? Most likely however it is the future. Whether you feel the need to be a man, woman, or an inbetweener, it is important to note why you are doing it and what benefit it brings to the society at large. I sound like a communist and I hate myself for it, but these words do bring up the main points as to why so much hate exist in the first place; fear of loss and loss of control. Perhaps instead of doing the straight is bad or whining about cis norms you 'individuals' can advocate the ways your paths can benefit the society as a whole. Otherwise just like I said before, these arguments are pointless!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Anyway, while I am not a transmedicalist, I do find myself very jealous of other trans people who do not experience dysphoria, like my pain and profound hatred of my body was foisted upon me by random bad luck, or worse, as some punishment from on high for BEING who I am. So seeing people who do not experience the same pain and are able to be trans AND love themselves makes me jealous and a little hateful. In a way I feel like I need to feel as if my gender identity is more valid than someone who does not suffer from gender dysphoria in order to justify my pain, but I realize it isn't healthy and just makes me more of a victim.

"I think this is a good video, but I think there's something to be said for the part about mental disorders and brain scans. Because I think it invalidates a lot of people who have been diagnosed with other mental illnesses.  Does everyone get a brain scan to diagnose a mental illness they might have?  No. I've been diagnosed without a brain scan.  Does that mean there's no physical basis for these diagnoses?  Not really because brain scans of other people who were diagnosed with this disorder have shown differences in brain structure between people with a diagnosis and people without one.  But if I didn't have a brain scan, how do I know whether or not I'm one of these people?  I guess for sure, I don't know. And that part of the video kind of has a point, because no one ever scanned my brain. But a mental health professional who is familiar with the type of people who have this diagnosis and has been trained in diagnosing people based on a set of traits that we typically share, did give me a diagnosis and that's how a lot of mental health diagnoses go down. I don't think it's fair to say that 'if you don't scan someone's brain, then there's no proof of a disorder.' It's kind of like saying 'Even if you clearly have all the physical symptoms of an illness, we really just can't prove anything until the test results come back.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've been mulling this video over. I'm a trans woman, and this is a really excellent encapsulation of various perspectives on us, and trans people at large. But I'm always hung up on the point presented at 29:32, whenever it comes up (Here and elsewhere). 'I'm a woman because I am' isn't an explanation, it's just repetition. And when Tiffany says that it makes us sound delusional, Justine's response essentially affirms that we're delusional. She says 'Well, delusion is what separates us from the animals,' which all but states 'Yes, it does make us sound delusional, and being delusional is fine.' Maybe I'm misinterpreting, but that's what it feels like, and that doesn't agree with me at all, personally. My gender isn't a delusion, and we shouldn't  be okay with being deluded, in my opinion. The sentiment of 'You're a woman because you are' struck me as profound and revolutionary the first time I heard it, but whenever I loop back around to it, I'm like, 'Yeah... and?' It feels like a cop out to me. I've been mulling it over a lot particularly because (And again, I may be misinterpreting) it came so late in the video that it left me with the impression that that was the conclusion you were drawing, with finality.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Still a proud truscum here. Also, only caught on to the parody because I somehow watched the Vice video before seeing this. It's neat and all that Contra is shutting down the 'validating' angle, but try this on for size: I currently think that everyone should be allowed to express themselves however the fuck they want and feel 'valid' (whatever the fuck that means), but if you don't feel dysphoria, you're not a transsexual. You can call yourself whatever you want. 'Non-binaries' 'MOGAI' or whatever. I *implore* you to. Just get your appropriating, colonizing asses out of the 'T' and into whatever category you want to call yourselves. I can be open-minded, compassionate, etc. while still acknowledging that the whole problem here is that as creative as people can be with how they choose to identify and how they want to express themselves, they just couldn't seem to create their own space instead of invading one that already exists and taking it over.  You're valid and beautiful and deserving. You're also a bunch of colonizing, appropriating assholes actively attempting to erase an existing population so you can feel more 'valid' with your own process of 'self-discovery'. 'Transsexual' is not a bad word. You're just trying to make it one because that's colonization 101.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Certainly im not going to drag you out and make you do homework in your moments of darkness and minimizing the human cost should always take precedence.  I get the feeling, no, the NEED to just say 'fuck it I dont care' once in a while But understanding things is HOW you fix them.    Anything has an explanation. If it exists theres a reason. You are already in accordance with the truth. The real truth can explain away what you actually are because you could not exist. We can debate about how you interpret your experience ('Am I sad? Hungry? Comming fdown with something?') but your experience exists.  It's the idea that 'explanation' is hostile to that that is thje problem","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"As often when you have dichotomies the answer is often 'neither', like everything about identity gender is probably not one thing but a mosaic of biology, nurture, environment, society and personal choice. When you think about it its kind of a qualia though one where most people experience only one sensation in their lives unless they're grenderfluid. When you think about it it makes sense that ppl would describe what they sense in flovery language - Humans use metaphors whjen things are difficult to explain A lot of 'male vs female brain' talk is kinda junk science even when used to - and of course learning and socialization does affect the brain, information and influence moves both ways its not just biology dioctating behavior, behavior impacts biology, like training a muscle - they are one.  Grab a middle aged person and never mind their gender, but you can probably see trances of their job and hobbies in which areas are developed   Also this isn't purely opinion air talk, there is actual evidence There is clearly SOME inborn basis - you couldn't take a cis kid and raise them as another gender, they would develop psychological symptoms indistinguishable from trans people (we know this because psyvhology is a new and inexact science and the 20th century sucked) But the idea that gender roles are inborn is just as ludicrous because of how wildly they vary across history and cultures.  So in my opinion the most reasonable thing is that people come with a behavior to 'mark' themselves, but HOW they do that is completely derived from culture   Biologically this could be like secreting pheromones, performing mate attracting behaviors etc. Behavior meant to 'mark' yourself - in cis people that aligns with reproduction because most of us are kids of people who reproduced, but it doesn't have to. You can do the girl dance even if youre aroace because it's insctinct, like male birds singing. The thing with humans is that compared to most animals we are more programmable. We follow the same basic drives but HOW to accomplish them is, to an extent, variable according to our environment and choices.  I've read that 3 year olds often draw random conclusions about gender ('only boys like cold water') because they're still in the process of extracting that info from the environment.  But even cis 3 year olds care alot about being perceived as their gender - they do it in a not so nuanced way because they are still three, but they do.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

This is where I am: Gender Dysphoria is a societal construct within relation to transness, not a medical label necessary to be considered trans. One would not have Gender Dysphoria if it werent for societies strict outlines on gender. If we had a different outlook on gender, the dysphoria would never be there in the first place. Someone would not be needing treatment to necessarily transition from gender to gender, but to prepare them and help them through their interactions with society now that they are transitioning.

"I think the biggest thing isn't that we are defining having dysphoria or not, it's that we are defining what dysphoria is. For some, it's physical. Having sex organs is uncomfortable, or having a mismatch with your voice makes you want to stay silent, not having breasts or a beard makes you feel incomplete, etc. For others, it's societal. How people see you, treat you, or interact with you can make you feel like you are in the wrong place. For some other people, it's behavioral. Your actions that you do based on either societal upbringing or physicality. Need to adjust your pants or manspread cause your dick is in the wrong place? That's a masculine presenting behavior. Do you cross your legs when you sit down or walk with more hip sway? That's feminine presenting behavior. And, all of those forms of dysphoria are valid. Your clothes present a certain way according to society, so if it makes you uncomfortable to be seen that way, that's a form of dysphoria because you're being seen as a gender that isn't you..","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've always identified as a cis lesbian, but lately I've been wondering if I'm really a cis woman. I have a few masculine features that I shouldn't be comfortable with, and yet I am. I often have short dark hairs growing out of my chin, and it doesn't faze me in the slightest. I don't like shaving my legs or armpits, not as a feminist way of showing that shaving is unnecessary, but because I'm more comfortable as a hairy beast. Sometimes I wish my voice was deeper, not because I want to sound more masculine, but I think if I had a deeper voice, people would take me seriously. I like wearing men's clothes, and I like dudebro action movies. And despite all that, I don't feel any dysphoria at all. I'm not even a little bit uncomfortable when I look at my chest, hips, and whatnot, same as I am perfectly fine with having a hairy chin. I've never had a problem with using she/her pronouns, but if I'm comfortable being this masculine, am I really a woman? When I think of it, I think I'd be fine using any pronouns, really. I like feminine things, and I like being vaguely feminine. I like masculine things, and I like being vaguely masculine. I don't ever experience any discomfort in my masculine features or my feminine features, but it feels like I should be. I like calling myself a cis girl, but I'm not sure I am?

"I think the point of 'transexual' vs. 'transgender' was kind of glossed over but I think it's worth focusing on. We shouldn't use transexual for two reasons. First, it's not inclusive because there are people who identify with other things than binary sex. Second, a lot if people still think that trans people (specifically transwomen) change sex for sexual attraction. They think gay men change sex so they can be with straight men. Retire the term, it's stigmatizing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I personally don't believe that transtrenders exist in the first place. I find it highly hypocritical to be offended at TERFS for being assholes and then insulting other trans people because their experience of being trans doesn't match your very shallow definition of it. Are there some people who thought they were trans and ended up backpedaling after a month or so? Of course. Why? Gender identity is confusing and there is nothing wrong with experimenting with different labels. That's why there is such a proliferation of gender identities in Tumblr. It's people--typically younger people--who are experimenting. Their experimentation isn't hurting anyone so I don't see the big deal. You also have to take into account that gender is a social construct and is inextricably tied to the cultures that created it in the first place. This is why what is and isn't female is so inconsistent across cultures and time. It turns out that different people from different areas have differing ideas jus like how different people from the same area have differing ideas. Is there a psychological aspect to gender? Well, of course! Our very sense of self is tied to our brain and our psychology. Social contructs do have power though as Contrapoints pointed out in her NonBinary identity video. Money like gender has power over society and both can force people into tiny little boxes in which the minorities have little freedom. This is why I believe we--as a society--needs to be more accepting to those who are different from us. Although we may have differences in race, finances, politics, gender identity, and sexual orientation; we are still human beings living in a very difficult world. Life is hard enough without us goal keeping what is and isn't valid or which people even get to exist in the first place. We're all human, and I think we can find some solidarity in that!

"This is a very well thought out video. I'm very impressed with the production quality and the philosophical exploration of ideas. I also appreciate that your bias was stated although a little subtly. You can't have a true debate without getting a bit of emotional baggage out of the way. I'd have to say that I'm somewhere in between being strict and being just not caring about what people do. Although I'd like a bigger exploration into how gender expression and sexuality differ and if gender expression really is different to gender identity. I say this because I had my own gender crisis over being a lesbian. I feel like a lot of people aren't just the peak of femininity or a flannel wearing tomboy. We're somewhere in between. My crisis was about not really identifying with the dominating butch/androgyne or the pillow princess lip stick (not that being one is a bad thing). The truth is that you can be a submissive butch. You can be an effeminate dominatrix. You can be neither. You can be both. Its just a style. A personality type. Not who you are as a person. Lesbians can like dildos. There! I said it! I will also say that I don't think its necessarily a bad thing to be classified as a mental disorder. All it implies is that you simply cannot function with the way you are at that moment. It is diagnosed in a way as anxiety or depression or body dysmorphia is diagnosed. Of course it has to do with your feelings. It has everything to do with your feelings! That doesn't mean your identity isn't any less valid. If anything, it means you're more valid. What I identify as a 'transtrender' (there needs to be a better word) is someone who isn't necessarily UNcomfortable with they're assigned sex and identity, but is questioning based on things like they're breasts, sexuality, abuse, or expression. I wouldn't say they're completely sane in the head, but it would be difficult to say they would benefit from transitioning. However, they do it anyway to feel accepted and secure. No one should be forced to transition in order to feel accepted. Its okay to be questioning. Its also okay to say you think you're questioning. What I would recommend is to experiment with social transitioning. Watch testimonies from both happy trans people and detransitioners. Learn the effects of procedures. Learn what can go wrong. Do you envision yourself growing old in your identity? Do you feel emotional pain when being identified as your birth identity/sex? Do have any underlying anxiety, depression, or self esteem issues that could be causing you to reject your identity? Is it from the wanting of a fresh start/acceptance or is it of your own want/discomfort with your body? Is it your expression that is bothering you? These are all very deep and exploratory questions that I have had to ask myself over and over again. Sometimes I just had to experience reality and get out of my thoughts. See what I feel in that moment instead of thinking what I should feel or what I could feel. I identify as a cis lesbian btw.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'Excluding trans people who don't medically transition is the best way to get people medically transitioning who shouldn't' is the best solution I've heard to that criticism (which I do think has some validity).   I also don't see why transgenderism can't be psychological, social and biological. Dan Savage has this saying about sexuality that's something like 'there's what you fantasize about doing, there's who you actually do, and there's what you tell people you are, and the more in line those things are with each other, the more content you'll be, but it'll probably never be perfectly aligned.' And I just feel like the same thing applies to gender. There's the person you fantasize about being, there's the person you present yourself to the world as, and there's the label you slap on it. The more those things line up, probably the happier you'll be. The same way anyone who naturally perfectly conforms to societies expectations of them will probably be happier than those that don't. I don't think it needs to be more complicated than that, and I also think that it's something anyone could sympathize with if they tried.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Justine's argument sets up a faith-based case for religious fundamentalists to make. 'My god just exists, I have faith in him, and he says your gender identity is an abomination.' And that would be JUST as valid as our existence. Then it becomes a battle of faith-based beliefs, a holy war.   This is why logic and evidence are important. Either we admit that trans people are socially distinct from standard men/women (but still have a right to exist) and it's based on a mix of psychology and sociology, or we submit to absurdity and holy war. I think option one makes the most sense.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm a left leaning centrist. I don't literally pick the halfway point between the left and right views on an issue. Instead, I listen to both sides and figure out which one I agree with more. For 80% of issues, I'm on the left (especially human rights issues.)  For example, abortion: I don't think that only half of all abortions should be allowed. Instead I'm pretty firmly pro-choice.   Another example: I think all speech needs to be free, outside of the 'fire' in a crowded theatre.   Another example: I think all LGBT+ people deserve the right to be married, to not lose their jobs or house/apartment/etc for being LGBT+, and that every right a cis hetero person has, an LGBT+ person deserves the exact same. I don't believe that we should only let lesbians get married but not gay men or that gay women aren't valid but gay men are. (Also, gonna mention I'm the B in LGBT+, don't know that's relevant or not, but I thought I'd mention it lol)  Idk if contra was just joking there, I mean yes, she was obviously joking with the 2 & 1/2 gender thing. But, is the joke: 'haha, a half gender is absurd,' or 'Dave Ruben is an idiot who cant pick a side, Haha'   Or, it: 'Centrists are idiots who can't pick sides Haha.'  Here's the thing, I don't believe in dogmatically adhering to one side of the partisan aisle on every political issue. I value thinking about each individual issue and coming to my own conclusions; it just so happens that for me, the majority of those conclusions happen to fall on the left. This is why I call myself a left leaning centrist.  I've just noticed a lot of hostility lately towards people who call themselves centrists by channels on left-tube. With a false interpretation to what centrists stand for. Not just this video, but similar jokes in an hbomberguy video, a philosophy tube video  and others I'm forgetting right now (I think, maybe folding ideas or a Lindsay Ellis video, but don't quote me on that.)  I mean, it's really making me wonder, do you guys honestly think that the centrist stance is to find the exact middle of an argument from the left and right, then decide on a mutated 'compromise' on the issues? That we think that 50% of all abortions should be legal? Or the LGBT+ community should only get 50% of the rights heteros get. That's pretty much the jist of the recurring centrist jokes I've been hearing lately.  There's a comment on this video with 308 likes currently that is just this: 'As for how many genders there are, y'know, I'm gonna take the centrist route and say 2 1/2.'   It's just the joke I'm referring to, quoted directly from this video. Which reinforcing that many people really found it hilarious and it seems like it's just laughing at a strawman of what a centrist actually is.   So, I'm asking everyone here... As a fan of Contrapoints, hbomberguy, and a lot of other left-tube channels, but also someone who watches channels on the right and a fan of some of them, too...  Do you really think of centrists this way? Is centrist like a dirty word to you? Do you think someone who calls themselves a centrist as nothing more than a stupid person?  To me, never listening to other opinions and strictly adhering to a dogma of only the right or the left is stupid. Challenging your own opinions by listening to the other side is something I find extremely valuable.  The following quote is how I pretty much view my own conclusions I come to on political discourse. Even though this quote is attributed to Aristotle, there is an argument over whether or not it's a real quote, however, I still think it sums up how a centrist, or at least this one, views politics.  'It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I realise that all the characters that you play are supposed to be stereotyped, but it's very distressing to see people in the comments calling on everyone to love the FReAKs of the world. And obviously, I take great offense and exception to that.   You're a big influencer now. People look to you for ideas, judgements, and advice.  The problem with trying to play roles that you just aren't, and at the same time, stereotyping them, is that it comes off as inaccurate to the lived experiences of those demographics.  The conflation of otherkin and nonbinary people, and portraying otherkin as 'basically a joke' is pretty damaging as well.

Gnc being a choice.  gnc does not = non-binary But most non-binary people dress androgynous or non conforming.  Gnc people may use non-binary pronouns, but gnc people choose to present and go about themselves and their identities differently than how they were assigned at birth. Highlighted word here is CHOOSE. Because they p r e f e r not to be put into restricting boxes society has of men and women. Which could be a different definition to someone else. Maybe gnc is the same as non-binary to someone else, but I think they're set apart by definitions of gnc=choose to present how they do and non-binary=have dysphoria and have to present/transition to lessen their dysphoria. Transgender people do not choose to be the way they are, and I think that distinction is important.   Though with saying that I guess the rebuttal would be(and what was on the video), 'how is a gnc person different and why aren't their feelings as valid as 'real' trans people.' And what I would say to that is that there are VAST differences and experiences between gnc and trans people. Especially binary trans people. I think there needs to be a distinction between trans people because a bunch of people are being thrown under the label that is too broad.  What most people try to distinguish between transgenderism and transsexualism. If a male presenting amab person(who identifies as trans) is given a platform to speak or talk on trans issues, I don't think it represents the majority of the trans community and is unfair to group them in with someone like a trans woman who has undergone all the surgeries and hormone treatment. Not being an ample voice for trans people, basically. Because their experience is vastly different from the other, so they are hardly comparable and therefore should not be out under the same label.  And if I make ANY kind of argument mentioning the public eye people will bring up how that's societies problem because they don't understand. And as said in the video, conformity to try 'winning acceptance.'  I don't believe it's conformity to 'try to win acceptance' but the majority experience of trans people to not be ignored or covered up by those who have much different experiences. The majority of trans people I have met and encountered want and actively try(who are able to) present as their identified gender. Eventually medically transitioning for themselves to lessen their dysphoria(unless for some legit reason unable to). I think the distinction between people having/needing a medical intervention for their gender dysphoria vs people who just outwardly present differently should be recognized. But then again, the video mentioned how that apparently leaves out people who are questioning or whatever. But those who are questioning are just- questioning? They can't identify themselves as trans or cis till their figure it out.   I am not trying to invalidate other non-binary people or gnc, just trying to say it should be considered a different thing because of vast experience differences.  Non-binary is at an overlapping grey area between trans and simply non-binary as its own thing. Because of it not always being a medical thing.   Gnc by it's own is not a medical thing.  And it's important to not demedicalize transgenderism/transsexualism(however you want to define it as) because to most(can I say all? I think I can say all) transgender people it is important and vital to transition(excluding those who want to, but can't transition due to medical reasons, unsupportive family, financial issues, etc).  Transgenderism and transitioning isn't to break the boxes society has, while non-binary and mostly gnc that's what it is. Their identity breaks boxes whether they intend to or not.  While binary trans people are wanting to/transitioning into the other binary gender. Aka into the binary boxes. Not meaning they are hyper masculine if they are a trans guy or hyper feminine if a trans woman. Just that they are male or female. Which is within societies boxes. We aren't trying to lick cis boots or conform to be accepted. We are 'conforming' to be the gender we are.  Non-binary and gnc should not be considered the same thing as binary trans people who plan/want to medically transition. Non-binary is kinda tricky as it's half and half, but I think it is still important to have enough distinction to have them within their own and not take on the trans label-? So I guess I am just sounding like a massive exclusionist. Am a massive exclusionist I guess. Which I guess I haven't realized till now.   Feel free to bring up any points/arguments I have or that may have been in the video that I missed/forgot about that would have been a good rebuttal to anything I said. I'm curious and open as to how others think and consider these ideas. I am willing to listen and/or talk to anyone with similar or simple text different opinions/thoughts as long as you're respectful.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

If you don't have dysphoria, it's just expression/identity at that point, and that's fine, but if you do have dysphoria, which is also fine and valid, I believe that there is suffering that needs to be addressed and lumping the people with dysphoria together with those who don't is not helping those who have no idea about any of this to learn - it just makes it more confusing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think the distinction between transgender and transsexual is important, that way people that have dysphoria due to their biology can have a label to distinguish themselves from people that have dysphoria or discomfort with the societal roles expected of them. A person that wants to transition to the opposite biological schema but not adopt the associated gender performance is distinct from someone that wants to keep their anatomy the way it is but adopt a disparate social role. Transgender could then refer to mere gender transition whereas transsexual could refer to mere biological transition. Both could occur in the same person but both are not required to be 'trans.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"*Contra makes a great point here.* The *Socratic Dialogue* is the best way to engage in conversation, especially concerning politics and opinion. Because *a debate is a war, and a conversation is an Alliance!* You see,  I've been debating for years through middle school, high school, college and well... As a lawyer, that's pretty much what I do for a living. And something that I've realized, is that the Socratic Dialogue is the probably the best way to both access people's feelings as well as to (most importantly) convert them to your way of thinking. You can never convince, say, a Right winger (or anyone else for that matter) through debate. Because what I've learned is that debate always means *war* 99% of the time. While a wholesome heart-to-heart conversation is *an alliance* . And I feel that the Socratic method of conversation is by far the best way to get your feelings across, while also Sympathizing with others' ideas. Yes, Right wing ideas might be horrible and deplorable, but you have to get through their layers of personality and opinion to find out why they adopted such ideas. You then discover that some traumatic experience in their childhood or early development period is what made them behave that way or posess that deplorable opinion, and at that point, since you are already layers deep into their mind, you'll be able to convince and deradicalise them much more easily!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Why do people get angry when men speak on behalf of women's issues? Why do people get angry when white people speak on behalf of black issues? Probably for the same reason that Blaire White gets upset when non-binary people speak on behalf of trans issues.  For a minute, let's put aside the whole issue of trying to determine which people are 'valid' or not. After all, when a woman gets upset that a man is speaking on behalf of women's issues, she is not claiming that the man is 'invalid', merely that he is ill fit to speak on women's issues. Likewise, when a black person gets upset that a white person is speaking on behalf of black issues, they are claiming that this white person is 'invalid'. Now, you may disagree and think it is fully acceptable for men to speak on women's issues or white people to speak on black issues. Or you might not. But either way, the argument has nothing to do with who is 'valid' and who is not. It has to do with people's experiences and problems related to a specific subgroup in the community.   Trans people like Blaire White have very specific issues that they face and causes that they may fight for which are very different from the issues which Non-Binary people are working to solve. And Blaire, as far as I can tell, is arguing that mixing the two forms of activism together results in them causing problems for the other side, stepping on each other's toes or one group taking precedence over the other, etc. After all, we can't actively fight for every single worthy cause all at the same time, that's simply impossible. There's not enough time nor enough public interest to solve all the world's problems at once. This means some causes will naturally take priority over others. And if Non-binary people are being taken more seriously than trans people then, at least by Blaire's logic, trans issues are ignored in favor of Non-Binary problems.    Why do so many feminists reject/belittle men's issues so much? Because they believe men's issues distract from the issues faced by women or that solving men's issues will negatively impact/make worse the issues faced by women.   If you support the way feminists demean and belittle men's rights activists, then as far as I'm concerned, you have no room to talk when it comes to Blaire's views on the trans movement. But if you support both feminists and men's rights activists (or would like to see both groups come together in a egalitarian movement), then disagreeing with Blaire's stance, to me, is fair and consistent. If people could just be consistent with what they believe, I really don't care where you ultimately fall on the issue. I just wish people could stop being hypocrites.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"What I walk away with from the discussion at the end is that we can have a theory for an individual trans person's identity, but we can never have a unified theory, because people come into trans gender identities for wildly different reasons. Some people transition to fit into a gender role, some to break it. Some have 'phantom limb' sensations of a differently sexed body, some genuinely believe they are autogynephiles. Some have had a trans gender identity since before they knew what genitals were, some believe they repressed their true identity for most of their life, and some genuinely believe they changed their gender identity. No theory can unify all of these people. Tiffany Tumbles is actually right about this part: aside from sharing a disprivileged gender identity, she really isn't anything like Baltimore. This doesn't mean we should stop examining the causes and meanings of trans gender identity scientifically and philosophically, a position I despise. But we should all recognize that trans gender identity does not have a single unifying cause or explanation, and we need to in order to truly empathize with each other and fight for our rights. To do that, we need to start by recognizing that if one person is misrepresenting how another trans person feels, it isn't necessarily because they are a 'trender' or 'truscum' but because they feel like their own story is being trampled on or misrepresented. For example, I often find myself frustrated with gender performativity theorists because my personality and hobbies are quite androgynous but I consider myself a woman, not at all non-binary, because I identify fully with the female body.

"Hi! I love your videos, Miss Points! You really manage to penetrate these complicated, controversial topics, and, identifying as a centrist, I do so enjoy watching.  So the following stuff is not meant as hate or an attempt to poke holes in your argumentation, but rather it'd be cool if you read and responded to this because I'm genuinely interested.  So first one: There is science that shows that (binary) trangender people's brains show a lot of similarities to the structures of cisgendered brains even from a young age. I would argue that means the biological argument has at least some traction.  And second: 29:09 Actually, there are, well, no complete theories to explain homosexuality, but still a lot of evidence that shows that, at least for gay men, there are biological causes as to why they are gay.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I want to avoid being the (can't thing of the right word, starts with an e but it's similar to this but not really purposeful) instigator. I want the actual wellbeing to be good more consistently in the long run vs letting people feel happy for a moment and depressed in the end just bc being in this or that nonbinary identity made them feel something positive for a brief moment but has a bigger backlash of negative. Also pronouns are pretty big to me. How much should I care? Is me calling the pronouns just doing the 'instigating' or does it matter if I do it while still trying to make sure that role doesn't harm them? I don't know.

"Gender disphoria vs cultural transgender is pretty much like physiological depression vs self-perceived depression. One is a medical issue, the other isn't, but goddammit can we respect BOTH, please? That way if you're trans and have GD then you can get the medical treatment you need - including SRS - and if you're trans and don't have GD you can identify yourself the way you're comfortable with, period, without fucking laypeople trying to use people who don't have GD to deny treatment for people who DO have GD.  And yes, I do mean that people who don't have physiological symptoms of depression don't need meds, but they do need therapy and have to be respected, instead of being used to deny treatment to people who truly do need antidepressants to survive.  Acknowledging different issues that look the same as different is more intelligent than trying to shove everyone in the same basket.

I've found it intensely frustrating that we have to explain why we are the way we are over and over, and everyone's got their own theory that they think is absolute fact. My rebuttal has always been an absence of one. It doesn't much matter to me what the machinations under the surface are, I just know that transition made me feel better. Not perfect, but better. Why isn't that good enough? And there's little else in the trans community that makes me furious more than people who've scraped a little bit of legitimacy and acceptance who turn around and use it to dunk nonbinary people, especially nonbinary kids. Trans people, people who know exactly how that feels, subjecting someone else to it. It's textbook bullying, it's hardly even complicated or hard to see.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Reminds me of 10-20 years ago (and probably earlier) where the big topic was finding genetic validity of gayness. The idea that anyone would give a fuck about that these days is honestly jarring, it's not even 'born this way' anymore it's just 'yeah that's a thing.' I think this whole search for scientific validity is just a stepping stone in society's attempt to understand something new, compulsively categorizing what it is and isn't until it just blends in with the clutter and its existence is taken for granted. People like Baltimore are scary in this tenuous era of trans acceptance, but they're not going to just pop out of existence until it becomes more convenient. It's very easy to look at a glitter-beared They and think 'can't they just tone it down?' but it's much harder to look at yourself and your own idiosyncrasies, however milder they probably are, and confront how unfair and intolerable it'd be if someone demanded YOU 'just tone it down.' There's a reason Baltimore walks around with a glitter beard and you don't.Once you truly accept yourself and stop allowing others to determine the worth, validity and limits of your identity, once you stop living in that cage and feel that freedom, you can finally look at others and understand that they shouldn't be caged either. You can grant YOURSELF that freedom, you don't need to wait for society to give it to you. Yes, some people might look at Baltimore and then judge Tiffany by what they saw, but it's ultimately Tiffany's choice whether to accept that burden, as if Baltimore is an extension of herself that she has any control over. But it goes both ways, too. As much as the Tiffanies of the world can be abrasive and mean, at the end of the day they're trying to defend their access to medical treatment that they believe is vital to their quality of life, just like the Baltimores of the world are defending the freedom of self-expression that they believe is vital to theirs. Neither can come at the expense of the other, but whenever in-fighting occurs it's as if there can be only one. Just feel it's worth a mention, because I really do see the Baltimores of the world often taking their own lack of dependence on medicine for granted in their attitudes towards trans medicalism, so it's no wonder that the latter group sometimes feels threatened. But that's the beauty of no longer living with the chains of prejudice, you can be individuals and pursue what you personally need to feel whole without worrying about jostling or being jostled by the next person on the chain. Anyway, that's my unstructured rant, thanks for the thought-food, now I must rest.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I kind of do believe that 'Trans-Trending' is a thing. But I don't believe it's the same thing in being 'Non-Binary or Androgynous', I believe them and support them, not trenders. Its hard to explain, but you know someone that's trying to use the term 'Trans' for nefarious purposes. Like political gain, social media attention, and it's not genuine. Like you just know. There are certain things in life that can be explained... are they 100% facts, No. not even like 65% facts. But there are relations that over-time can lead to causation. Are women who transitions brain mass and construction more a like to a cis-woman? I don't know, it's a theory based on limited research. Are there 4 over prominent genes in women who transition? I don't know, they say so but it's limited research. Did I ever need to be told by a doctor that I had 'Gender Dysphoria' No. Because that's not what makes me a woman, you're right, I just am. But there are relations to actual facts. Trans-trending is virtually trying to eliminate all the research and studies we've done, which have given logical explanations to even our own cis-supporters who don't understand. Facts and science are important, they dont over-take the general fact, that we all should be accepted for who we are, but that will take time. For now, It's just hard to sit back and let even Non-Binary people take over the 'Trans' conversation. I love my own non-binary friends, but that's like immigrants  from Latin america or hispanic-americans  (who have wholly different problems right now) try to argue the case for Black people. They're related, similar struggles, similar prejudices, feelings, but they're two different groups of people. And there would be major uproar if the hispanic community took over the conversation of black rights, or vice versa. Trying to skew their facts, information, research, feelings, thoughts, and personal experiences. But this is all with love, regardless if you're non-binary, trans, or even a 'Trender'. I believe everyone deserves the respect and love that I and the community can offer personally. However, try to understand someone who is trying to transition (who may be Androgynous or Non-Binary), transitioning, or transitioned, how they may be frustrated with this conceptual group of people. How trans people i've met feel is that they're home is being taken over essentially, that it isn't there home, there safe comfort, there label anymore. They feel like there being invalidated in the conversation of liberation of everyone, that's really what it is. And it's mainly and usually by white non-conformance, which dominates trans people of color, and all these other conversations and issues.    - XoXo, Ji","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"So Justine saying that the slippery slope argument made by the transphobic and conservatives is ... correct? A potential consequence, or blow-back if you will, may be that if your non-binary gender is based on your own internal feelings, then does your acceptance for accommodations by wider society also depend on the subjective feelings of others? There is a certain definitive clarity to saying 'transwomen ARE women' which then can be used to support something 'transwomen can use female-only spaces like locker rooms & bathrooms', but adding a spectrum of people self-identifying in various ways without undercuts that argument. Then how is that preference necessarily any more fundamental to your identity than any other aspect, like being an artist or an Opera fanatic might be?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I really disagree with the 'brain scan' argument. Dismissing dysphoria because of the lack of a brain scan is like dismissing someone's depression or ASPD for the same reason. Depression also affects the activity of the brain. Sociopaths and psychopaths, according to multiple studies, have  different wiring - if you'll allow that expression -. Does that mean that we can't diagnose somebody with depression or ASPD if we don't check their brain? Aren't symptoms enough?  Otherwise, I can see the rest of the points. Although it's kind of dumb how the people who choose to represent gender non-conforming people constantly dress ridiculously.

"Biologically and scientifically there's two genders. More if you consider a few abnormalities in physical appearance showing various amounts of male or female characteristics. BUT there isn't a biological need to dress or act a certain way based on your genetics. You're allowed to do whatever you want to your body and what you wear is your decision. People don't understand this but in the future, if we make it there, nobodies going to care what you wear or like. What is someone who grew up wearing both men and women's (stereotypically) clothes going to think if they're trans. Or will the social construct of trans not exist. Also trans trenders are real. They don't feel the pain that real trans people feel because they don't actually stand behind how the express themself. Honestly don't even know what I'm trying to y'all about here because I'm super high and tired. But. Also. We don't really need more than three genders. Male. Female. Androgynous. It covers everything but people want to keep making their own unique thing. Btw the way you dress does not dictate your gender so if you wanna be a trans girl who wear men's clothes oh well. As long as you are actually trans and sticking to what you believe you are it's no ones problem. But people who are bi gender or whatever other random shit people make up is so confusing. Please just say androgynous and then explain how you feel. Idk if this is offensive but I'm not trying to be. Please explain how you make up a gender. Where does it come from. What does it mean. Gender concepts are so fucking stupid and I have more important things to worry about like dying children in Africa who can care less about being trans.

I'm a cis woman and I'm a lesbian but when I was struggling with my sexual orientation I found myself struggling with my gender.  I never found myself 'on the eve of transition' but because of my upbringing I had a hard time separating sexuality and gender.  Basically 'if I like girls does that mean I'm a boy?' sort of thinking.  So for me, while coming out, I became very androgynous and obsessed with the idea of having a penis in which to fuck a girl.  Fast forward several years and I'm very femme and married to a wonderful soft butch woman.  Thank you for validating that period of discovery that still left me with many questions.  This showed me that no one's journey to find themselves is simple so stop trying to compare it to others.  Thank you for showing us that it's ok to question your gender or to detransition and doing so doesn't mean it invalidates trans people!

"I don't have a problem with non-binary folks but stop putting yourselves in the same category as transsexuals. There should be no trans umbrella because it blurs the line between us and you. There is a clear divide between gay men and lesbian women, you wouldn't get confused between the two. Sure there's bi/pan but I would never claim to be the same as a lesbian because I am attracted to both males and females be it transsexual or cis, however, I have yet to meet a non-binary person I could be attracted to cause every one I've met has been so fucking obnoxious and subversive for subversion's sake rubbing it into everyone's faces. You wanna be a cosmic starchild non-binary rainbow unicorn, go a fucking head but stop being so obnoxious about it. Just live your life and don't bother others, sure you'll look weird but I won't say a word against that but no every non-binary unicorn I've met has shoved their nonbinariness down everyone's fucking throat. No one likes people that shove their sexuality down everyone's throat. Flamboyance can be tolerated, it's their life but don't shove that flamboyance down everyone's throat like it's normal, it's not and sure a big part of that is cultural but I would much rather have a society that just let people be rather than shoving weird shit down people's throats.  I just want to be normal or as normal as I can be with my fucked up disconnect between biology and brain+self and y'all nonbinaries disrupt that attempt at normalcy by shoving us all under a trans umbrella and blurring the lines making people think I'm somehow like you, putting transsexuals under much more scrutiny and making attitudes towards us more hostile because people think of the obnoxious loudmouths among your ranks when they see me (admittedly I pass pretty well so people don't tend to know I'm trans but I know other less fortunate transsexuals who are under more scrutiny and judgement because of the damage to our reputation that your obnoxiousness and blurring of the lines between us has done).  Genderfluid people I feel less negatively about as I know some and can imagine how bad their situation is, even worse than ours, never able to feel completely fine as just as you're getting comfortable with say being a guy your dysphoria flips and you're rushing to strip away the masculinity for the now comfort of being a girl and round and round it goes, no transition that can solve or alleviate it. I guess some nonbinary folks are dysphoric about being both a guy and a girl preferring something in between and while I don't get it and your solution to dysphoria isn't based in any scientific biological reality, I'm sorry, there only are 2 sexes, I guess the closest thing to what you want would be artificially becoming intersex through transition but even then it's not like you become some third sex, just an abnormal deviation from the biological normal of the binary, but glad it might help you, just accept the reality that this does not make you some third, millionth or billionth sex as there are only 2 and abnormal deviations thereof.  As much as it pains me I know I'll never be truly female, not in an objective scientific, biological sense. I guess technically I could get damn close with the only remaining maleness being my chromosomes but I'll never be a real woman in that way which I don't really know how to cope with and the only reason I'm still here is cause I have no guarantees there is anything after death and I'm too weak to test my luck there and would rather keep suffering and try to alleviate the suffering by adapting my body closer to what my self says it should be.    Nonbinary folks blurring the line between us transsexuals and y'all is really painful, hurtful and harmful. Go ahead, advocate for yourselves but please change your messaging, stop blurring the lines between me and you, I suffer enough without your blurring of the lines making me look like a joke. Not to say that y'all are all a joke, as I said, some of you I guess actually desperately need to be some weird in between between male and female to feel ok. I don't understand it but I'll support you as long as you stand on your own, not piggybacking off of transsexuals and being obnoxious and annoying, I'll call you they (I hesitate to say I'll call you any other of the billion pronouns popping up left and right cause ffs that shit's ridiculous, all your identities aren't as identifiable as say different races, if you won't be male or female just accept people will see you as other, thus they/them), I'll even accept those of you for whom nonbinary identity isn't a life or death matter (fyi my femaleness was a life or death thing and I wouldn't be alive today if I couldn't transition) just stop making my transsexuality look like a joke by blurring the lines between me and you.  There's male, female and other. Sure again biologically speaking I'll always be alongside nonbinary folks in the other category (btw, some if not most of you don't actually change your biology at all to become other, own up to that and accept you're simply engaging in self expression at that point and remain biologically your birth sex, won't stop me from calling you they but a spade's a spade biologically speaking) but I'm getting as damn close to femalethat it wouldn't matter for most people (while not denying the sad reality that I'll never truly be 100% biologically female) while y'all are floating around somewhere in the middle. That puts a clear distinction between me and you. In most cases I have more in common with cis females than you guys and am perceived as one 99.99% of the time. Please just stand on your own and stop hurting us transsexuals by blurring the lines and please acknowledge the reality of 2 sexes and deviations thereof in between and that a lack of medical transition means you're still your birth sex while in my case all that's keeping me male is my junk (soon to be fixed albeit sadly not in a way completely identical to a real biological female as a neovagina is really not the same anatomically speaking as a cis one, it's just not built the same way, merely a decent approximation, something I am painfully aware of and not denying, btw idgaf if y'all want that nonbinary 2 in 1 genitals surgery or getting rid of your junk entirely, free country, knock yourselves out if it makes you feel any better) and my chromosomes (I have hope reproductive stuff may be solved through new developments in regenerative medicine aka lab grown organs and much sooner potentially through transplant, sure it won't be my own organs but they'd be inside me if only for a few pregnancies temporarily getting me as close to biologically female as possible, besides, cis females can lack all kinds of organs, not only reproductive but also vaginas for instance)  Point being, please don't be an obnoxious loony bellend twat like Baltimore Maryland. Stand on your own and stop blurring the line between transsexuals and nonbinaries, 2 completely different things.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I literally cheered at some of these arguments because of how good the writing is. Contrapoints is packed with biting wit, genius, and empathy. The world-building in her videos is so deep. I tell everyone to watch her!   I've honestly been angry for a while about 'transtrenders', or genderqueer/non-binary identities (sure, even though I'm a cis gay man and can't stand on the same leg as Tiffany Tumbles here). Without realizing it, I've been frustrated that there's no way to 'prove' non-binary identities, and it can give the appearance of 'opting in' to queerness now. I think Natalie covers that pretty well here. But this video, and so much of Natalie's recent work, has really opened up my understanding of gender presentation. I love the section on transmedicalism - a word I didn't know, but explains so much about the attitudes towards trans people by the cis majority. Baltimore's argument that 'gender dysphoria' may be the /real trend/ fucked me the fuck up (also that is a hilarious name!).    So much to dissect, not to mention the production quality! Her looks are obviously on point, and I think her scenery, graphics, and lighting are very classic Contra. Great sound design in this one too, loved Baltimore's esoteric theme music.   I'll be thinking about this one for a while, I'm not even over 'Beauty' yet. Gender shit so radical it's got me questioning my gender. Natalie is leading us into a whole new conversation about this that we're just getting ready to have.    Amazing work Natalie!

"[dislike] Being transgender is not a hat, you can't take it off, thats the problem of lumping in non binary or gender queer people to that label.  As contra said, many people go from being non binary to transgender, however that isn't to say that they should be lumped in together. Both are different things, slightly connected, but it is disingenuous to they are the same thing. LGBT 'gatekeepers' are the worst, they project their own pain onto others, but that doesn't mean that they don't have a skerrick of truth to them. I would prefer to be non binary over trans hands down, the level of internal pain is astronomically different.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"In the dialogue, in the end no, the natural scientific arguments and evidence  ( not connected to transmedical movemnet)  has not been disproven, I know they are characters but will say that  if one means the modern science in neurology, genetics, endrocrinology and medical science. Even the dimorphic diffrerence one  connects with gender dysphoria and identity neurologically is found in kids, even trans kids. I am sick an tired of hard  social constructionist poststructuralist theories from the seventies that some linger on to.  We are not just blank slates,   I do not think it is black and white but i will say:  Personally I think the extreme identity anarchist are just in deep, postmodern bubble that no truth exist or limitation to human will and existence and it is all down to the individual, we see people inventing new genders every week and some being trans and then all of a sudden not being trans, but then being star gender and then bla bla. At worse some argue that one can be what ever one says is without context or relation ot the real world. They say one chooses to be trans, that can decide to be trans one day and not be trans another.  That hurts me, gender dysphoria almost killed me.  Gender dysphoria is not a choice and being trans for many is for them a curse. It is for me a joke to romantise and turn to something one can wear as a title because one wants too.  Two, we have ancinet transitioners, the scythians feminized their bodies with estrogen from mare urine and this has been confirmed by archeologists and was mentioned by Ovid.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is one of the best videos I've seen on the philosophical questions underlying gender and identity. I can honestly say, it's really illuminating for a straight white guy like myself and I really appreciate what you do, Natalie.  The way I see it is... Gender is a social construct. Meaning, there's nothing real about it on a material level. Gender is whatever we want it to be, whatever we say it is as a society. However, our *beliefs* in gender (and gender roles) have material consequences. The longstanding oppression of women by patriarchal norms, as an example. I can't blame the women who feel hurt by the presence of people who seem to freely 'play' with gender as if oppression can just be turned on or off at a whim. I can see how some might see it as frivolous and dismissive. However, I don't think any of this needs to invalidate anyone's identity. Isn't identity itself a social construct? Yet, identities have material consequences as well. It seems to me that the feminist project has always been to expose gender for the construct it is. The inevitable goal might be total abolition of gender as a concept. Perhaps a future world would be one in which everyone is radically individualistic and free from any sort of gender signifiers or constraints. But as long as patriarchy exists, this can never be achieved. As long as patriarchy exists, so do the material consequences of the roles it demands from its subjects and all the hurt that goes along with that.  I personally think that if we want to take liberation seriously and work to build a world where everyone is radically free, we need to accept everyone's identities as valid. Yes, even if you want to identify as a cat. It sounds silly, yes, but people who experiment this deeply with their identity are likely still searching for themselves and constructing a more permanent identity or role in society. Let people experiment. Let people find themselves. I think validating radical modes of living and identities can be a revolutionary and liberating practice. And perhaps that includes validating the hurt some people feel from class oppression of any kind. I think we all struggle, and I think we all assume that others struggle less than we do.  I dunno, I'm thinking out loud here. This is a difficult topic, but I find it powerful and interesting to think about and I hope the left can start to become less divided by thinking these things through and talking about them with each other.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Great video Contra. My only concern is that by basing our ontology purely on internal identity, we lose what categories actually mean. What if there's another option? What if we say that gender as a category doesn't have to be prescriptive? What if gender is just a descriptive category of the traits that maps onto the bimodal distribution of biological sex, and we can just not enforce gender roles? I feel like that's an easier solution. Because if you base what someone 'is' purely off of their internal sense of identity, then what identities does that apply to? Is it just gender, or can we do race as well? If we don't have to meet any standards or traits that we associate with certain categories so that we are perceived as that category, is Rachel Dolezal actually black then? Can anyone say they're anything and we have to accept it? And is it wrong if we do not perceive people how they perceive themselves? Like if someone does not perceive a trans woman as a woman, or Rachel Dolezal as black, is that transphobic? What does it even mean to 'be' something? Is it just a feeling? And does that feeling have to be based in something objective about yourself? Can you 'feel' like anything? With trans identity, we seem to all agree that people can 'feel' like other genders- can people 'feel' like other races? Other species? I'm not trying to be silly here, it's a real question. Where do we draw the line?    I'm not even entirely sure what identity means anymore. We seem to have taken the idea of  'third person perception based on observable traits' and then formed a mental category based on that, turn that mental category into a word, and we then take that word divorce it from what it originally meant, and then try to apply it to 'first-person identity based in experience.' And there's something about that that I think we get wrong. I think trans identity is valid, and I want to accept everyone's identity as what they say it is, but I just... I'm not sure sometimes about certain identities, and I can't really explain why. I think some of this might just be linguistic confusion, placing such an emphasis on language and trying to be a word, rather than trying to just be. I don't know; it's something I've thought a lot about and I still don't have the answers.    I'm not sure what I think. I would appreciate any input or advice anyone is willing to give me.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think there is a middle ground that you missed. If there is a binary male and female then there would be an outgroup, which would be non binary. For every box or group, there is inherently an an out group or outside of the box. There is also a difference between gender expression and dysphoria. Gender expression can be on a spectrum, and we should be respectful of people's gender expression. If someone goes by they/ them or whatever they feel most comfortable with, I think it is only respectful to accommodate. My wife (who is trans) has a bit more of a conservative view than I do, but would still be respectful of someone, she has a view that gender itself is a combination of biological characteristics and social ones. Primarily secondary sexual characteristics, since those are what is socially looked at to identify someone's gender. Since she does struggle with gender dysphoria, she doesn't quite get people who don't who are trans. On the other hand, I think you can very easily not fit into either box, which is where non binary comes from, dysphoric non binary people makes sense. For people who don't have dysphoria, but don't want to be constrained by societies narrow definition of what is and isn't a specific gender imo could have any range of gender expression and go by whatever they want in the process. They seem to be deconstructing the societal expectations of each gender and just expressing themselves however they like. I wouldn't exactly call those people trans though (at least in the context of transitioning, but they would definitely be trans in the sense of across gender), I feel that something like genderqueer or  not othering it at all would work. I think in the future the societal constructs of gender will be deconstructed to the point where all gender expressions will be seen as just that, a gender expression, but when that time comes, people who need to medically transition their bodies, due to dysphoria will still exist. I don't think 'transtrenders' are being trending, I think they are changing societies perceptions (very very slowly). There can both be medically necessary trans individuals who need to physically transition and people who want to embrace the gender expression that makes them the most comfortable. I almost feel there should be 2 different categories for it so that they don't get confused by the mainstream. Because while technically both would be trans, they are 2 completely different experiences and mean 2 different things. I don't know maybe we could use genderqueer for people who don't have dysphoria and trans for people who do. Because queer is like atypical, which could describe the atypical gender expression, while trans would describe the transition across genders. Just an idea, so that the 2 very different things don't get combined.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"dysphoria is not about feelings in the same way that depression, bipoliar ecc... aren't about feelings. I was dignosed whith genetic depression by a professional who only needed to see me for a few sessions and get to talk/ask questions to me so that he could accurately understand what was my problem. I never got my brain scanned but there was enought proof to  diagnose me whith this mental illness, and guess what...  depression isn't about feelings, it's about my brain lacking some fondamental parts to enjoy life as you do and I need medicine to take off the edge just as people whith dysphoria need to take the necessary operations/steps to help them. Now I don't care why you transition or if you transition at all, but the statements that were made at the very start of the video, and on whitch the whole argument is based on, is very wrong. I belive that dyshoria is real, that it is problematic for the people that feel it and that it's not based on how you feel but on how you were born; personally I don't care why you transition if the end goal is to feel better whith yourself, to be able to function like a normal human beeing or ecc... unless you do it just to be quirky ( just because I think that it could be dangerous for the person involved ). I belive in nonbinary and I belive that nonbinary are trans because I have seen people colse to me and in the media struggle whith beeing assigned a specific gender when they are not but I have also seen ( i'm gonna talk about a friend of mine so this might be a specific case or not true for every one ) where they initially felt they had to be nonbinary for the way they expressed their self and didn't follow specific gender norms and even thought they felt fine as a femail they socially transition. Soon after they started to feel uneasy and revers dysphoria because they were not trans and do still now have problems whith it; they had to come back out from the closet as their assigned gender but it was very tought for them.   that said, do transition if you know that you are trans not if you feel like you are not what you are by birth. Transitioning is hard, not just phisicly but mentally as well, you woulden't want to take a medicine for an illness you don't have ( this is a metaphore btw ).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I can understand that being transgender does not have to involve self hate as much as being more comfortable in how you look as a certain way, etc. I do not think every nonbinary person is transgender, since the connotation for that is transcending the physical form to fulfill a role 'meant' for the opposite sex and abiding by that sex's appearance standards and would seem to involve some sort of medical treatment or procedures. However, I agree that gender is not simply about genitals or any conceptions about how we should perform and express ourselves in society.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"female brain is more capable in multi-tasking than male brain, even that male brain can be trained to multi-task ( good example is competitive gaming, where our brain is forced to multi-task heavily to raise performance in the game ). Sadly neither of multi-tasking is perfect multi-tasking. Both multi-taskings cause your brain to focus less on the other tasks it performs, it isnt the same as computer multi-tasking ( which is also split into pseudo ( our brain acts much more like pseudo one ) and true multi-tasking )   Male brain tends to be focused more on analytical spectre, while female brain tends to be focused on creative spectre. This is the reason why males are more likely to be engineers in technological field while women are more likely to be creative, like hair stylists, make up artists, artists and even doctors, since doctors need to see the details, which is the strength of female brain.   females tend to take less risks or no risks at all, thus females have drastically lower work injuries and deaths compared to males. This is also the reason, why males are more likely to end up in higher positions, because they take risks more often.   females have better information recalling, mostly from times of sexual selective pressure.   Other differences are locations and size of parts of brain and their weight on the person's decisions and functions.   Gender dysphoria isnt even THAT well explored subject as most scientists fear public backlash if they would find out something wrong or non-pleasant, so they rather dont go to explore things, that may be questionable for public, but valid for science. Or at least i think it is why.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"At 23:01 She makes a point about gender dysphoria which is technically true but she also ignores to science on the brain. Gender Dysphoria is a symptom that is caused by being trans. It is not what makes a person trans. They have proven that female and male brains are different. They have also proven that people who identify as trans have brains more similar to the sex they identify as than to the sex they are born as. Trans medicalism is not to gain acceptance by society. It is to validate gender re-assignment surgery as a treatment. I read about a how doctors are now able to detect transgenderism in kids through MRIs.

The disorienting soundtrack choices, the flashes of color filters, the way Jackie and Tiffany's looks have crossed this baroque threshold totally at odds with their more realistic presentation in 'Tiffany Tumbles'. To say nothing of the absolutely magnetic presence of Baltimore Maryland. Then there's the smaller details. Justine's smeared make-up signaling her conversation with Tiffany as a rebuttal to 'The Aesthetic' (in which Justine herself came to bear a resemblance to Tiffany, but no longer.) The way both Jackie and The Digital Messiah seem to be channeling The Dark Mother The Sea (has Jackie fully ascended to the role of Dark Centrist Drag Mom?). There's so many call-backs, so many stylistic choices which seem calculated for maximum artificiality, and YET the performances are easily some of Natalie's best. It pushes the  lack of closure in the dialogue portion into a strange, ungraspable emotional place I have difficulty verbalizing. If you ask me, this is where Contra's gone full Kubrick.

"Here's my take on it (nobody asked, but I'd like to discuss!): Everyone is right and wrong at the same time. I have two problems with the trans-trender phenomenon, and neither are about how good or bad individuals are, or how they should or should not present. It is about the phenomenon of trends themselves, and how they may affect people. 1: If it's trendy to be trans, lots of people are going to receive the wrong treatment. Bottom surgery on a non-trans person is... Well; functionally irreversible. And puberty-blockers carry their own developmental issues; once your skeleton is set, it's not going to grow according to a renewed puberty, to name one thing. 2: If gender is (ultimately) a choice, then health insurance companies have no reason to fund transgender treatment like hormones and surgery. That... Is an outcome that is inevitable if all of gender is viewed as non-biological. And I'll be honest; that prospect scares me.   Before I continue, here's three summaries of how I view gender: Gender role: This is performative.  Gender category: Like all categories, a social construct. Gendered behaviour: Behaviour informed by sex-typical neurobiology. This is the stuff we naturally do; gender here is emergent from biology. These three things are all real, and all different.   Now; individuals are different. Some people are more masculine, some people are more feminine, and these differences can depend on topic.  This is where I get to non-binary: I don't think it's a useful category, because with a binary system that is on a spectrum, _everyone_ is non-binary. Everyone sits somewhere else on that spectrum. Of course, the same can be said for pan- and bisexuality. So I do: Everyone is, to a larger or greater degree, pansexual. The strength of your preferences on that spectrum (in part) determines how people categorize themselves. I believe sexual preference disgust is purely performative. I also believe that most people strongly prefer people of one sex over the other, but that is, again, a matter of where you sit on a spectrum. Now comes identity: It is fine if you _identify_ as non-binary. But it is an identity. It is not a gender, but a club that you have categorized yourself as belonging to. In fact, I think it's perfectly valid to create as many categories as you like. I don't think it's _useful,_ but it is perfectly valid. So yeah, I don't think identifying as a gender (in itself) is any more (or less) valid than identifying as a dragon. Of course: Gendered behaviour is a thing, whereas Dragonned behaviour is not (though Dragon role does exist; you can be a performative Dragon). That's where the difference lies between the two.   Most people I know do not identify with their gender. Their gender is just traits. Some of it is indeed performative because cultural normativity. Some of it is not. Most people _just do not care._ If they did care, and did assign gendered categories to all of their personality aspects, and they did think of those as parts of their identity, then they would all have to conclude that... They're non-binary. Which is the primary reason I believe that that category is not useful outside of a subcultural identity.   (Also: Gender dysphoria =/ trans. I've had gender dysphoria. It passed because I learnt to deal with the root causes. Not trans. I'm just insane in other ways, and a culmination of contexts caused me to have severely dysphoric symptoms regarding gender and sex. I also believe that not all trans people are dysphoric. If you're have a male-typical brain and are perfectly okay with having a female body, then there's a good chance you won't suffer (much) dysphoria. So if you are naturally inclined towards more male-typical behaviour than female-typical behaviour, then I will categorize your gender as 'man.' Regardless of your sex. If you disagree with my categorization, then that's perfectly fine, but the way we categorize the world is up to ourselves, and nobody can tell you that your categorization system is invalid.)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Technically, we don't conduct brain scans on people we ultimately diagnose with conditions such as depression, anxiety, ADHD, schizophrenia, even autism spectrum disorder. All these conditions, like gender dysphoria, can be detected on brain scans since they result in atypical brain patterns. Gender dysphoria is a result of abnormal natal hormone exposure that forms a grey/white matter ratio that reflects the opposite sex rather than the person's assigned sex.  While I see the point of the argument, the reason why we don't do brain scans on patients with gender dysphoria is due to cost and such. Since we rely on psychotherapy to diagnose mental illnesses, the medical community has decided to trust the DSM 5 criteria to diagnose dysphoria rather than needing a costly brain scan with a long wait time in order to confirm it. There is a biological basis to gender dysphoria and it could be detected if someone were to run the tests for it. I have yet to see the studies for non-binary people, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Political correctness and a lack of funding discourage anyone from doing those studies to prove it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This really shows the internal struggle that I think most binary trans people go through.  Recently my friend 'A' just came out as non-binary to my friend 'K' (a cis girl) and me (a transgender guy). When they did so, K mentioned how she didn't view either of us as male or female. I talked to her about it and she realized that it was rude to say that to me, but the whole situation demonstrates why traditional trans people don't always except the less traditional ones.  I think kindness is usually the best policy, but it's hard to be kind to people that misrepresent the majority of the community.  I think it wouldn't be as much of an issue if there was more of a separation between traditional and non-binary trans people. That's where the word transsexual comes in to play, as an alternative to let cis people know 'we're serious.'  On the other hand, why should we force them to be girls and guys if they don't want to be? I mean can't us 'freaks' stand up for those 'freaks?'  I think trans people who hate non-binary people are the ones with the most crippling dysphoria. So I also sympathize with them.   Non-binary people aren't inherently bad, but their intentions aren't clear to people who aren't them. I don't believe they're doing it for attention, but if it's not to alleviate dysphoria than what could it be for? I personally think that they think gender is more of a feeling and they don't feel like a gender because nobody really feels like any gender unless being the most stereotypical version of one.   Until we find out what being transgender means scientifically, I describe it as 'the overwhelming desire to physically become a different sex.' Which is why non-binary people are confusing.  I don't know what to do other than support non-binary people as well as separate myself from them to prevent confusion.  Edit: I also once thought I was non-binary about 4 years ago.  I also don't want to be a douche bag, so I'm not going to bring it up to any non-binary people. kindness is always the best policy.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Honest question, is gender dysphoria primarily biological in origin? Would it be possible for someone who had never been been exposed to any societal norms or expectations growing up (obviously that's basically impossible, but imaginable, like if they were hypothetically raised by wolves or something) to develop gender dysphoria?

"I think our languages also adds to the issue. One of the weirdest things to me is that we even specify the biological sex of a person in their job title, e.g. waiter/waitress, actor/actress, businesswoman/businessman, etc. And the neutral version of the label is always the same one we use for a male anyways, so why make a variant word to specify that the person has bobs and vagene. I don't think the actual sex of a person should be looked at as an important part of someone's identity in society. No wonder some people think they must have a different brain if they don't fit into the right box of standards. The biological sex of a person is only really important for medical reasons, legal identification, and in the bedroom (if you're picky). Hopefully one day we don't have to pick a label in order to fit in and justify the way we feel most comfortable expressing ourselves.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thanks for this Nat!! Solidarity can sometimes feel missing in the LGBT community. I receive negative comments from straight people & from queer people about my bisexuality, claiming I'm 'faking it', 'experimenting' or more likely to cheat on my partners. It can be so frustrating.  There's this pressure to almost represent all bisexual people, and prove that I'm not a cheat by being strictly monogamous or prove I'm not experimenting by never communicating any doubts or confusion I experience in my sexuality. It's normal to question yourself and I think when people within the community pressure you to be this acceptable version of a queer person as deemed by straight, cis gendered people it's no better than someone telling you should be different, and to be more 'normal.' We're all freaks and freaks should stand together.

"Third genders in other cultures are just excuses to push gay people into places, I don't see how that's a valid argument? Especially with the fact that it's also on the basis of religions and as an atheist I reject that.   I think our assumption on how men and women look, act and behave should change but I don't agree that it requires the removal of men and women. Or the addition of other genders. It offers medical benefits, and cultural ones, not only that it invalidates me as a gay male. How am I attracted to men? How are there straight people? Why do men have better spatial awareness then women? How do women have better tendencies to notice emotional behaviours? Why do males children gravitate more to object centric toys to women who gravitate towards humanoid toys? All these random behavioural situations and yet, there is no majority differences? Obviously it's not the same for everyone? And there are exceptions.   But that should be why we need to be willing to remove social assumptions on what a man or a woman can and should be. Not just destroy the whole construct for a select few? If that's the case. Why have an age of consent? Why be anti incest? These are all arguably social constructs. But I guess it's okay to be selective to few...","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I know you probably won't really see this. But... I just wanted to say that you've come a long way. Like, a really long way. I discovered you after HBomberguy's DK64 torture porn stream on twitch, and heard your delightful and heavenly voice the very first time.  Then I looked up your channel, and did what I normally do on a newly discovered tube: troll through the back log of videos (nautical trolling of the ocean floor reference, rather than internet/monster/asshole trolling)  Your soul seemed to shine through you. The topics of your videos, the pain, the struggle, all of that was so artfully and precisely put on display in a way that seemed like you had the thought of 'fuck it. If I'm going to feel like this either way, I could at least help other people.' And sure, you started out with things along the lines of 'IS GARBAGE AND THIS IS WHY' but the topics were always a lot more 'Draw steel against the flames of fascism' rather than 'this shit stinks, lol'. I felt like I wasn't being talked down to. I felt like everything you said was being presented in an interesting way, sure, but I never felt like I was being called stupid or a moron for thinking some of the things I did.    People may be drawn to your aesthetic, or criticize you for it. I think it's very important that you frame these things like this. When you're throwing a new idea at someone, an idea that uproots everything they might have thought, an idea that twists and turns AGAINST what you knew to be the prevailing winds of reason, then that feels like an attack. It's been scientifically proven. Now, attacks can be successful. You can really change things by attacking them, by damaging them. But people are a little different. People adapt, change their argument, start falling back on more and more primitive means of dodging and deflecting. Half of it isn't even in the bounds of reason. How do you undermine defenses that are built around prejudice and tradition? Hate and underlying motive? Those things are insane! They are the enemy of reason, and the blades of a man who doesn't care if he's right, just knows that he will never be wrong.  I'll tell you how to combat that kind of insanity: with your own insanity.  Your aesthetic, your wrapping paper, your delivery. It is madness. It has always been madness. It's the same madness we all feel, that horrible feeling lingering at the edge of our vision at night, that if we look just a little bit to the left of reality, we can see the abyss. That dread fear of the dark, that gnawing doubt about everything, you've taken that as a given and built a whole channel around it. People think of doubt as a horrible thing, and don't get me wrong, a lot of the time it is. But doubt is also how you pass laws against slavery. Doubt is how you write laws to protect civil liberties. When you stop taking things as granted, stop trusting in the natural or supernatural order of the world, that doubt can lead to a better and more perfect union of people who really just want to get a long.  Doubt is what lets trans people be trans, they doubt the binary gender norm. Doubt lets homosexuals fall in love and actually let that be a happy thing rather than some tragic admission of a mental disorder. Doubt is what I use every day to come to terms with the horrible abuse that I was told all the time was just fine, and you don't need to see a doctor, and don't tell your teachers how your mom really treats you-  Ugh, this is getting long and meandering.  There's a lot of bad things that indecisiveness can bring, but being indecisive is how evil people stop doing evil things. It what stops hate. And that's what you bring with your madness: the varied and satirical impossibilities and absurdities are perfect defense for the real ideas you try to impart to the most stubborn of us.  Also, you wearing a beard looks really weird. Like, in the same way that I would think it strange should my wife suddenly sport a beard. Or me for that matter, but that's different ;)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've been waiting to watch this video until I knew I could dedicate my brain to fully watching it, and I'm glad I did, because this was flawless. I love the Freedom Report videos, and Jackie, Tiffany, Justine, and Tabitha are all amazing characters. Baltimore was awesome too and I aspire to be that fabulous, zen, and confident one day. They kept their calm as they were being made fun of and pitied them instead.    I know you write and play all these characters, and I would love to ask if you fell into some of these roles at any point? How much of them is personal experience and how much is made up?   Nonetheless, I've been a fan for a while now and still look forward to every new video, of course, because you pick some of the best topics and some of the best arguments. Between your channel and the sociology class I took, I can defend gender variance and my own gender better than I should ever need to (but not nearly enough for what I'll have to)  Thanks for these videos.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This mentions a counterargument against the presentation of female vs male brain differences, thing is, you don't cite the sources of these counter-studies while the opposition provides them, and many of those sources that are pro-binary-brain have been utilized in medical treatments other than merely trans issues-- depression medication research, consumer research, evolution and multicultural studies, all have demonstrated that a binary brain is, in fact, a real thing.  But the opposition hardly ever posts any sort of research against this, and if they do, it's minuscule in comparison.  Cite your sources, compare the research, win the argument.  Also: 'Can you logically prove you love your own children?'  Yes. Actually. You can. Oxytocin and vasopressin when you're involving yourself in social situations with your offspring. This is why child attachment theory is important to adoptive mothers who don't have that chemical-mental bond established at the moment of birth.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I consider myself a trans man, because I want a male physique. Non binary people are also valid in my theory, because they want a mix of sex characteristics.  Not only that, but it's sexist to say that just because someone presents in a masculine way when they're female, that they're somehow less of a woman.

"The argument that a doctor didn't scan your brain is absurd. That's like asking a person with schizophrenia or depression if a doctor scanned their brain. In order to diagnose psychologist look at symptoms and how they are presented over time. They answer surveys or questions which a person can answer and help a psychologist or psychiatrist come up with a diagnosis. They are also made so a person who tries to fake a disorder when taking this tests is revealed by their score. Transgender is a label that is defined as someone who has gender dysphoria. Also it wasn't always called gender dysphoria, it was labeled under something else, I forget it's name m. The DSM has changed the name and diagnosis to fit new criteria or to appease people. Now the third gender in other cultures is completely different. The native Americans and Indians base it around religion and not an actual third gender but more like a being or person with a special gift. It's ignorant people who read these facts in a tumblr post that think this. It's like saying a psychic is a third gender.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I was a bit nervous going into this video, but i really enjoyed it. I thought the commentary between characters was well developed and made it very easy to see the other side. Initially, I thought Tiffany was a little exaggerated, but the more I watched, I realized she portrays a very real part of the transmed community. It's been a great way for me to reflect on a group of people I previously defended.The only issue I had with this video was that Justine seemed to claim there was no scientific rationale for either homosexuality or transgenderism. Trans people very much tend to have brains more similar to cis people of the same identity, just as there are established theories on the causes of homosexuality (theories rather than hypothesis). However it is a very interesting question as to how a gendered brain connects to gender dysphoria :)   Overall, I think this is a GREAT video; it has gotten me to think, and even neutralize the part of me that sympathized with Justine's fear of gender non-conformity. I've come out a better and more thoughtful person. I know this is a lot to read, but (as always) I admire Natalie's work. I think she has a great impact on the people who are touched by her words and I'm really thankful for that <3","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

'There's no room to experiment and figure yourself out. You can't have anything unless you commit to it way too quickly, and you're not allowed to change your mind afterwards. So you better make the right decision (that's acceptable to me) by magic or luck on your first try.'  And if that pattern leads to terrible marriages, how could it not lead to trans regret?

"Genuine question from a cis woman here. I believe that gender and biological sex are completely different things, but having self evaluated what I feel I draw my 'womanhood' from, I've come to the conclusion that it's things like periods and PMS and having to worry about not getting pregnant. These are mostly biological differences that trans women will not experience even after a medical transition. Obviously I try not to throw my opinion out there randomly but I do wonder whether I'm being transphobic (and possibly misogynistic) by defining womanhood as an almost exclusively biological experience. Obviously there are exceptions to this rule (not all females have functioning a whomb) but it always stands out to me that the only thing that actively makes me feel like a woman is the fact that my pussy bleeds so if I'm in the wrong I'd love to know why.

"here's my theory of gender. it is not a matter of biology, psychology, or even performativity per se - it's a social role influenced by all 3. we are not born boys or girls. we are born babies, and we are then coercively assigned a gender based on our biology. we can eventually manage to change genders through performativity and often changes to our biology, and the urge to do so is caused by something in one's psychology. in every society, there will always be something in between - hjra, two-spirit, nonbinary folks who perform ambiguity, even just trans people early in transition - however, most people, regardless of psychological identity, will end up being one or the other. in my own mind, i am nonbinary, but in a practical sense, outside the internet, i am female. that is the perspective i bring to politics, to relationships, to my daily interactions with the world. that is a much better explanation than 'penis=boy vagina=girl', or than 'i'm a man/woman because i said so', or than 'anyone in a dress is a woman'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Lol I love that 'Tiffany' is even sporting Blaire's most-worn shade of lipstick  A little on-the-nose (er, I guess, more 'on-the-lips'), but I'm not complaining.  Okay. So. I have ONE gripe with the idea of not separating non-binaryism (with dysphoria) from being gender-nonconforming (without dysphoria). (For reference, I am Agender - I go by either Dani or D.J., though close family and friends call me Jack, a holdover from when I still thought I was binary trans - pronouns They/Them.)  Now, I know you've referred to yourself as 'the Tranny 1%', Nat, so maybe this is something you just kinda overlooked. But classifying someone as trans without the prerequisite of dysphoria, and therefore demedicalising transition, causes a huge problem for broke-ass cripple bitches like me: not having GCS & HRT covered by public or private insurance (I'm in Canada, so in my case, most of it is covered by OHIP, the provincial insurance plan, and the rest by ODSP, my Disability Support insurance plan), and therefore, not being able to afford transition. Which, in America, is probably wholly expected and common, since people there apparently have to crowdfund medical expenses to just to keep their hearts beating. But to me, in my privileged little Canadian world, that's wholly inconceivable, and thoroughly unbearable to consider. It's also completely unrealistic a situation for me to overcome, since I'm not attractive, popular, or connected enough to get the attention I'd need in order to fund my transition independently.  And while yes, a good majority of trans suicides can be blamed on transphobia and preexisting mood disorders piling on top of trans troubles, I guarantee you that the inability to transition has killed some people. I do not in any way believe that dysphoria only exists because of societal expectations, otherwise, would enbies even exist at all? Well, I guess that's technically debatable. But I can tell you that, for me personally, not being able to transition would kill me, and not because I care whether *other* people find me aesthetically pleasing in an androgynous sort of way. I care whether *I* think I look aesthetically pleasing in an androgynous sort of way. And while I'm not quite ready to start dieting and exercising to fully rid myself of the non-sex-characteristic-based dysphoria, I'm at least relieved partway by the treatment I've managed to procure so far. If I couldn't get to that treatment because I was poor, then... I probably wouldn't even be here commenting this, right now.  So yes, I DO agree with about 95% of the arguments you make here, and as usual, it was wildly entertaining and high in production quality (also, loving the cybergoth character, just as an aside). But class struggles - which you DID mention in passing when you noted that some trans people can't afford to transition, but didn't really expand on any further - are a central reason, as far as I'm concerned, why - at least for now - transition needs to stay medicalised, at LEAST in part. Like your argument in the Gender Critical episode about certain Abolitionist movements targeting the most vulnerable of a demographic instead of the most privileged, so too does this problem exist within the transmed vs anti-transmed debate. If the first people it would most severely negatively affect are some of the most hard done by in society, imo, you're doing social justice wrong.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I thought about it, and truly dislike how you dismissed and ridiculed transsexuality through this video.  Transsexual people exist.  A medical understanding of transsexuality is a voice which matters to people.  The science is suggestive in support of that voice.  It articulates a suffering which happy fuzzies, rainbow pride, and social constructionist jargon can't elide.  By shutting down transsexual people, you social constructionists are doing real damage to people with needs that can't be satisfied by the new orthodoxy of gender identity cults.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I honestly think that so called 'transtrenders' are actually a good sign because it means that this whole queer project is working. The purpose of queering spaces is to question and break down the norms and social pressures that keep people from living their lives authentically. People being comfortable enough to openly question their own gender and play with their expression in new and unique ways is kinda the end goal of the whole movement. Gender isn't static and it's to complex for us to demand people conform to rigid ideas of how one can live in their own bodies and what language they can use to convey their experiences. Its doing Cis, trans, and nonbinary folk a disservice to police their gender.  So I personally welcome all stargender, maverique, genderfaun, genderflux, genderfluid, bigender, agender, genderqueer, demigender and all other non-binary folks who just want to be themselves, and make it a little easier for everyone else to do the same.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There is some strawpersoning (ha) going on here in the depiction of Tiffany.  I'm sorry, but performativity and 'whatever, smile!' don't cut it when it comes to dysphoria.  Because the dysphoria of transsexuality is not merely psychosocial, but indeed, provably physical in etiology.  And that matters both for the dire immediacy of the medical needs of transsexual people and the framework which helps contextualize that experience.  Genderqueers and such go around admitting that they don't need medical support, they just do it as a bit of aesthetic fun.  Those understandings are diametric opposites, and ones which can't be bridged or amalgamated.  Ultimately the 'SJW' new orthodoxy of 'performativity' and 'social construction' will need to admit that for many trans people, there *is* something pathological, painful, and innate about their nature which needs a context that speaks to suffering instead of covering it up with rainbow flags and glitter.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Wow.  Being LGBT is way too much work. Looks like hours of time glamming up and barrelfuls of cash too.  Them playtime contacts aint cheap!  Well, its a better past time than watching NASCAR, for sure..    but wow... thats alot of work you put in to mimic the female gender.  Drag Queens are performers, charismatic, to be SEEN, hence Drag shows.  As a real bona-fidey woman with all the credentials,   It feels an awful lot like an offensive parody, not unlike the black-face minstrel shows that parodied, with affection of course, blacks...      Now, ContraPoints, you lucky queen you.  I came here to unload about something Ive been keeping bottled up because its hard to parse out to the normies of the world.  But lets see what you do with this fire cracker.  Full disclosure, I care not who gets off with whom, just do it in private with all parties willing and of the age of consent.  I dont want to see your cavorting in public anymore than I want to watch dirty-dancin and twerkin' heteros running down the street.  Its that social contract thing, so we can all go about our businesses without walking into poles as we gawk at someones jiggly bits out in public.  Its not a matter of being oppressed, its a matter of coexisting and not traumatizing your fellow man.  But I digress, because what Im REALLY here to drop at your doorstep and get a deep meaningful  opinion on from under the rainbow, is UNDERTALE.  What the F is Undertale, you may ask?  Or if you know, I bet you can figure whats coming next.  Indoctrination of children.  Its a fairly new thing, just the last 10 - 15 years or so at such a young age, and I stumbled upon this mass media blitz on the youth of the industrialized world purely by chance, skulking my way in the internet underground.  And lo, I found the Pride movement's nasty secrets.  The code.  The lore of anime games.  Go take a look at Google images and start seeing what is happening with some of that game's characters - Undyne (lesbian) Mettaton (Drag Queen), Sans, Papyrus, and even a Thelemic goat family Toriel, Asriel, Asgore, where incest is best.  Yes, thats right. We got everything subversive in here, for little kids.  Go take a look, and then come back and share with me your thoughts  on how the average family should deal with this subversive grooming of their kids before they even hit puberty.  Undertale is just the one game I stumbled upon when taking a good long look at Alefantis and friends over in DC.  Its amazing what you can turn up when you start turning over rocks.  Lots of creepy things UNDERground.  Yeah, I cracked the code.  Little monsters, underground, everything opposite of what happens in the aboveground where the normies live.  And Parents, if you want your kids to be kids until puberty, keep em away from anime, riven through with alt-sex,  and all these weird serial cartoons and games with lore far more complex than the gameplay.   Theres other games and cartoons out there as bad as Undertale, but because undertale is intended for the youngest children, its easiest for the nosey normies like me to learn the code being taught to our kids through seemingly innocuous games.  Parents have a right to know, but the name of the game is subversiveness.  Wink nod, Billy!  WE know, but mom and dad are clueless!  Clever...    grooming.  There ya go.  any thoughts..?  If the word gets out to all the god-fearing and atheist families of the world just what all the winking and nodding is about, your acceptance movement is  going to hit a serious snag...  Toby Fox is the only name directly associated with that indie Undertale game, but there were plenty of folks working on it.  Toby may think he is as sly as a fox, but he's just a hound dog sniffing around for a special boyhood friend or two....","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There actually is different shaped brains not due to physical activities that might have caused injury but due to brains being setup for different purporses. Trans tests are all the same, CT scan showing a male or female brain structure. Every trans person who's getting hormone therapy or any other kind of therapy, will first have to have this done, as well as get a psychiatrist involved to determine if it's simply dysphoria or if the person's brain is shaped as the opposing sex. In every case of  non-dysphoria, the brain is shaped in the opposing sex for the needs that that sex needs to survive. In F-M the brain is shaped as a male, in M-F the brain is shaped like a female. The science is valid, what isn't valid is when dysphoria sets in, which is where the person perceives themselves as not the gender they grew up with and looking at their body makes them feel like they don't belong in the body, however dysphoria shows the brain shape of the actual sex the person is in, and they simply need therapy and medication to overcome it so a girl with dysphoria will have the brain of a girl, and a boy suffering dysphoria will have the brain in the shape of a boy. Dysphoria is in the same classification of disease psychologically as phantom limb syndrome where the brain starts to believe that their body is not their own much like PLS where the brain thinks that it's arm or leg doesn't belong to the organism making the observation.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I feel like there's this wonderful thing about non-binary genders that is so damn appealing. I think the idea of seeing someone that openly identifies as nb feels confusing to many people because they simply never thought of nb identities in such a way. Most people would be lying if they haven't wondered the things they could have as the opposite gender, and even if gender didn't exist. Human's are jealous creatures, and it really is a shame that we put people in categories that presume certain characteristics from an individual that may or may not really be there, and these presumptions are then followed up by placing societal constraints.   I am currently struggling with my gender identity, as I was born a female and raised as one. Yet, it is not physical gender dysphoria that troubles me, but an adolescence that kept me from acting a certain way. I've come to loathe many of the things that society pushes onto women, like feminine fashion, marriage, raising children, etc. But I do not completely want to get rid of those things. I still like many of the things the female gender has to offer, probably more than that of male. Nb identity feels more like both acknowledging the existence of God, yet rejecting their authority, at least from my point of view.   I guess what I'm saying is that nb-ism is just a big 'fuck you' to the social constructs that have placed people into so many boxes. I feel like as a cis woman this is easy to say, but I fear that these societal gender roles harm much more than just the feelings of little girls like myself. I fear that men don't have the voice to say these things and that trans women, like in your video, are afraid to say because of the fear that they wouldn't be valid (and that goes for men too).   I guess I'm just saying that I would like to transition, but it's not that I'm fearful (maybe a little about what friends and family would think), it's mostly that I wonder if I'm valid enough to do so. Does being simply disillusioned with society grant a special pass for me to chose the gender I want? However, I guess I don't mind what gender I am perceived as, because I'm the end I value more what makes me feel good rather than what makes me valid in society's eyes. And I'd love to make people mad and confused too ","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Cock and ball torture  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   Cock and ball torture (CBT), penis torture or dick torture is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the penis or testicles. This may involve directly painful activities, such as genital piercing, wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation or even kicking.[1] The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Many of these practices carry significant health risks.[2]     Tamakeri (Yu Cu ri) (lit. ball kicking) is a sexual fetish and subgenre of BDSM within which a man's testicles are abused. The genre is also referred to as ballbusting ('bb' for short).[3][4] Tamakeri is the Japanese term, but it is used by many non-Japanese people to describe media where Asian people--mainly women--are participating in it. The dynamics of tamakeri consist of a masochist having their testicles hurt by a sadist.[5] The fetish is popular among heterosexual and homosexual men and women.[6] In hentai communities, it is often identified by either 'tamakeri', or 'crotch_kick'.[7][8]  Denkianma (Dian Qi An Mo ) (lit. 'electric massage') is a popular Japanese prank played between two people where one person puts their foot into the genital area of the other and shakes it in a vibrating motion.[9][10] Often this is done by grabbing the other person's feet, raising them, and then placing one's own foot on their crotch and vibrating it. This is often done between school aged boys as a prank similar to kancho and could be seen by a western audience as a type of bullying. In 2007 the crisps company Doritos released a new flavour of potato chip called 'Denkianma'.[11]","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"When I think of transtrenders I don't think about people like Baltimore.  Someone like Baltimore is out there living a queer life, being a gender rebel, and killing it.  When I think of transtrenders I'm thinking of awkward teenage virgin girls who read too much m/m fanfic, and as a result of that and Tumblr culture they would rather be gay men than the cishet twerps that they are.  So they tell Tumblr they're trans, and they go around fucking with people like Tiffany and cancelling them and throwing them out of the queer community.  But the cishet twerp calling herself trans is only doing so on the internet and has probably never told anyone IRL that they're trans and never will.  They won't live a queer life, they'll just perform on Tumblr, and shout down actual queer people.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I will never get what a female and a male brain is. Cause a female brain doesn't automatically love make-up, dresses etc. And a male brain doesn't automatically like cars, football etc. If you're trans, fine, go for it. But I will always think this whole trans thing is bullshit caused by society. Cause I don't see any transwomen running around dressing masculine. Transpeople always need to dress like a stereotypical man or woman. How is that not sexist? They just went from one box to another. It would be really intresting to see how many transpeople there would be in a world where gender roles were gone and everyone just acted and dressed as they liked. Would transpeople die out then?  This is no hate towards transpeople btw, just society's obsession over genders and how they should dress and act.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thank you Natalie! I live in mother Russia, so the news that Trans People Exist came to me when I was about 12, and I thought 'huh. I don't completely feel like a girl, so maybe i'm gendefluid?' And so, I came out as just that. Genderfluid. But then, people like Tiffany, and transphobic cis people told me that there are only two genders and that I was just pretending, so my self-esteem plummeted and I decided to come out as a trans man. Because I knew I felt more like a boy than a girl, so, this was probably it, right? So I held in every ounce of my femininity to fit the trans guy social role, and got way more acceptance than when I was a genderfluid person. And then, I went to an actual gender therapist and they told me 'Hey, why did you come out as a trans man?' And I said the truth 'I didn't feel acceptance when I was out as genderfluid.' And then I realised how that sounded. I was actually considering going on T when I grew up. And if I did, I would actually have dysphoria and de-transition. So it was not SJW propaganda that made me a 'transtrender', it was the truscum community. I did everything I could to prove to them that I was 100% boy, to prove to them that I have gender dysphoria, that I convinced myself that I did have it. I literally tried to purchase acceptance through conformity. Finally, when I re-came out as genderfluid, I felt like myself again. It was a liberation.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

So, my point is, I don't have to explain or logic to people that I'm a woman. People assume I'm a woman because they look at me and see tits. I don't think that trans people should have to either. I know that you're fighting for acceptance and against bigotry, but ultimately, I don't think you have to prove anything. At least to yourself.

If everyone does this, maybe we can avoid a lot of medical transitions that people would regret because they were trying to 'prove themselves'.

"Natalie, you're videos I have found incredibly intelligent and validating in so many ways. This video, I have no words. You're giving voice to some many of the feelings I have on a daily basis. It's been incredibly invalidating when I have been in trans spaces and my identity has been immediately policed, I've immediately been given advice about how to transition, about how my embracing of both my masculine and feminine qualities does not disqualify my transness. All of this without the knowledge that there are those of us who also are intersex separate from our trans identities. It's really sad to see those who ask not to be policed by the genitals they were born with, policing me for the presumed biology that I have and making assumptions based on that. It makes it so difficult to navigate ones identity when I feel the constant pressure from the cis world to fit into a certain box, where I am perceived as a 'queer man' and in trans spaces where I am often treated as a 'lady in waiting', measured by whether I am on hormones and plan to schedule surgeries.

"'Do you think you can purchase acceptance through conformity' - This is essentially the Uncle Tom stereotype all over.   Whenever there are marginalized groups, some of the victims will side with the opressors in hopes of being perceived as part of them. This is extremely counterproductive, as they are only useful idiots and function as a shield for the bigots. This allows them to say stuff like 'i can't be a nazi because I have a black friend'.     Same goes for Kanye West, aswell as Achille Demagbo. He is a black man advocating for the AfD, Germanys rising far-right party. It's hard to blame these people for trying to belong, it can be viewed as a type of Stockholm Syndrome. One of his most notorious quotes is: 'I'm proud of my country of origin, Benin in Africa, yet it is a privilege to live in Germany and therefore we cannot flood this country with africans'  The damage this does should not be underestimated as they support and enable fascist tendencies.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"1.) The brain arguments are true. You can actually look it up.  2.) Gender has social constructs, but it remains biological.  An experiment was done on a boy in the 70s who had a bad circumscion. They raised him as a girl and he was fine until he hit puberty. He ended up commiting suicide in his 30s and lived, miserably, with needless dysphoria... If gender was entirely social based, he should have been fine. It was obviously rooted in his biology.   3. Non-Binary people are currently not acknowledged as trans.  The concept is:   not conforming =/= transitioning. It remains in-touched because scientists simply refuse to research it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I just rewatched the videos with Tiffany in them and gosh her character is so interesting. I adore the sort of 'tumbling' down into the far right and her actions around other people then when she's on her own. Part of me wanted a redemption arc for her but at the same time I don't think redemption arc is the right word. I really want her to become...self aware? She's not a good person but I want her to be happy in a way. (Also I adore Baltimore's wig.)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I completely loved this (as always).  I think many of us know who 'tiffany tumbles' is inspired by, and I completely agree with your portrayal of her.  it's very clear that she is self-conscious and is in a lot of pain.  not to mention her overt denial of that pain.  it's truly disheartening to see a trans woman, who's identity is disregarded and erased by others, turn around and do the same to other trans women who are not a stereotypical example of femininity or identify as a dreaded and imaginary 'non-binary trans woman.'  of course, there are women that exemplify primarily stereotypical feminine appearance and behavior, but you can tell that 'tiffany' feels the constant strain of trying to fit that stereotype to feel validated by society - specifically the conservative audience.  shes blames the discrimination she faces on 'non-binary' individuals calling themselves trans or even being associated with the trans community.  it's sad.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm on a panel of queer individuals every few months, and most of them are nonbinary or present themselves in gender nonconforming ways. I'm a few years into my own transition and with every panel that goes by I pass more and more. At first, I hated sitting next to the other speakers, feeling uncomfortable and even upset to be associated with them. When a woman who hadn't been on the panel previously came on to speak once, I saw my own behavior in her immediately. You'd wonder why she was up there with us - she passed so well. Whenever I glanced over at her while one of the nonbinary folks was speaking, I saw her body was tense as if she were about to be subjected to parrilla - the lines around her mouth tightened and she'd slink sightly into her seat. It's being reflective of shit like 17:54 that made me change how I treat people who are even a hair out of the gender normative world.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"If gender is performative, then I can see why someone on the outside might think a drag queen is trans because they dress as a woman (or a drag king, natch), but performance starts in the mind. A drag performer is a performer first and foremost. If he sees himself as a man,  then that is true no matter how he looks. If he is a biological male who sometimes dresses in an outrageously female manner, then he sees himself as a man wearing women's clothes. This is why I lean more toward the performative theory. For me, I've reached the stage of life where cis, trans, androgynous (the term I used to prefer), etc. have all gone by the wayside. Now I call myself 'comfortable'. No more labels needed, throw on what feels comfy and leave the makeup alone. IDGAF what people think as long as I'm comfortable. ","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I am a straight cis man from Argentina so my opinion is possibly irrelevant. I believe that identity is a necessary political tool to acquire rights but it can become dangerous when reactionary groups are created, such as the Radfem that harass transgender people and sex workers. When different groups compete to see who is more oppressed by the heterocyst we are in trouble. I think that trans is a very complex issue that involves biological, psychological, psychosociological, social and even political factors, that's why I believe that the best strategy is unity in diversity, building a people formed by an alliance of identities to fight against neoliberalism and fascism.

"I love everything you do, which is why I want to address one question you left me with. Why did you let that point about argument against performativity theory stand ('actors playing women being just as much a woman as a trans woman')? An actor and a trans woman are both performing gender, that's true, but actors have an entire additional layer to their performance:  the social contract of the stage. They are attempting to convince us of something we know to be false, as per the request of the audience. People in daily lives have no such social contract. In fact, performativity purports to explain validity and so consenting entertainment (actors in dresses playing women) seems outside the scope of Butler's argument.  Thanks again for doing what you do.

"Just because 'third genders' are as old as culture itself does not make them any more real or even correct. I mean, human sacrifice is also very old, incestous marriages too, but that doesn't mean they're 'correct' or a good idea. The fact that something is old or not does not equate its validity or acceptance. Heck, not even the concept of childhood would withstand the trial of time (being it a postindustrial invention) and that doesn't make it any less real.

"I feel like dysphoria is very real, mostly because I experience it, but is far from an adequate test for 'gatekeeping' purposes as to whether someone is 'really' trans (because for instance a lot of people have autism, but not everyone with autism is nonverbal).   I feel like I'm being erased when someone wants to claim my dysphoria is all a matter of my self esteem and I can't sleep some days or even weeks of my life because of how wrong my body feels. But I think that having dysphoria and being a woman are different things. It's interesting to note there's a similar kind of conflict in the autism community between people who need assistance to get by and people who are fighting for respect in society over whether it's a disorder or just a different kind of neurotype. I can't really speak for the autism community as I'm still kind of on the edges of it (I was referred to someone to get diagnosed, but never got around to finishing the process. I have some executive difficulties and maybe some sensory ones to do with sound and pretty bad anxiety. So ok, probably autism but, respectfully... well. I dunno, that may be waiting on a medical gatekeeper with the same kind of flawedness. But I'm new at thinking of myself that way so I'm hesitant to speak, you know?) - but I suspect with the trans community the answer is yes, and. I suspect there's a reasonable flock of medical things that may cause dysphoria and that some trans people identify as women because, among other things, their somatic dysphoria but I also suspect there's a flock of social and psychological causes as well and I'm not convinced that a biological cause is 'better' than a social cause when it comes to an umbrella that could be big enough for everyone if we'd just let it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I can understand and respect the social aspect of being trans, but i really dont think its the whole equation. There are people as young as 3 who come out as trans even at a young age when you arent taught the difference between boys and girls. Trans brains are real, its the composition ratio of gray:white matter in the brain which women have more white matter (creativity) and men have more gray matter (logic). Having more white or gray matter does not make you more or less intelligent, it just changes how we think. I do think that trans people present themselves in the way that their peers do (think women including cis and trans women who they aspire to look like). I think the major diaconnect in this debate is that both sides are only presenting one half of the equation and leaving open flaws in their thinking for the other to attack. Overall we just need to be more civil and openminded about how we approach these topics, but i will admit the transmed side is currently more 'knee jerk-y' in todays conversation about this.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Funniest clip: My husband sometimes wears my panties and wants me to call him 'mommy's little slut.' That's between her and the Lord   Most important clip: 'Perhaps we should seek less to make people prove who they are and just show more empathy.'   I don't see why the Jackie Jackson's of the world need to 'understand' transgender or non-binary people. I don't need to understand gender disphoria. I just try not to be an asshole. That doesn't seem hard to do.   Also we know plenty of men and women who do not fit in stereotypical gender roles whether they identify as anything other than heterosexual or cis is besides the point. We all know guys who don't watch sports. We all know women who are not 'delicate' or emotionally sensitive. This idea of rigid gender performance is something we all suck at sometimes. So let's just trash it. Be the person you want to be. The world will adjust.  I strongly agree and live by that!   Also: As a soft butch lesbian I find so many overlapping experiences here. I remember trying to figure out how to 'perform' 'girly girl' femininity and I sucked at it. I was called a 'tomboy' for most of my childhood and felt as ease with that. As an adolescent and starting to understand myself as same sex attracted, I remember the most liberating experience was just finally being able to be myself with other women who were just like me. I didn't have to perform any stereotypical masculinity or femininity. I was just free to be myself.   That should be enough for anyone to understand.

"I'm AFAB, non-binary, very femme looking, but act quite masculine. As a little kid I refused to be a girl, but once I hit puberty, boobs and hips made me fairly unmistakably feminine. Yet I always felt like I was in drag wearing female clothes, and I even often exaggerated my femininity in presentation because of it. I did bind my boobs for a while, and often wished I looked more androgynous, but as the years passed, I learned to be more accepting of my presentation.   After years of being a trans ally (though I had no interest in medically transitioning, I could easily place myself in the mind of those who felt they needed to confirm their gender), and hearing more and more people come out as trans and non-binary, I finally accepted the label non-binary. I am generally very non-conformist, but I am also 43, and not in need of much attention. My flamboyant style and good looks used to garner me all kinds of attention when I was younger, and I am honestly elated that I can now walk down the street without people harassing me, hitting on me, or trying to tell me that it's not Halloween. People tend to not even really see me, and  I love it.   Today I was explaining to someone why it is unlikely that trans folx are 'just doing it for the attention.' First of all, negative attention is not like negative publicity: it doesn't really do us any good. I'm not a brand or a product, I have nothing to sell. But my feelings do get hurt when people call me names. When I used to dress all crazy-like, it was for two reasons: keep away lots of dudes (who were generally intimidated by my hyper-sexualized appearance) and to advertise to the other freaks that I was around. And a little to fuck with people's heads.     And that's perhaps the thing. The only 'attention' I am looking to garner as an enby is not the attention directed at me. It is to fuck with people's heads. I want people to question their gender assumptions. That's why I am loud and proud right now. I could have continued my journey being stealth, letting only my intimate friends know that I don't feel like a woman. I don't really care about what the world thinks of me anymore. I don't really care about the pronouns people use (though I do enjoy getting called Glenn instead of Glenda, but not enough to go around correcting people). My point is that while I have always had these feelings of being some sort of alien that never fit into the neat boxes of gender (and most likely wanted to be a man so as not to suffer the many iniquities our society visits upon women--I was brought up in a very feminist lefty household), my main reason to be out and loud about is for it to be a political act. I want people to question gender. I want people to look at me and be confused when I tell them I'm not a woman. I want to have the dialogue and the discomfort that comes with it.   This is turning into a very bad first draft of an essay. I'm rambling. I really enjoyed the video, thank you, Natalie, for continuing to churn out amazing, thoughtful content.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I love and hate simultaneously how this made me reflect on myself. Before I started transitioning, videos I found talking about trans-trenders made me question myself and actually stopped me from actually talking to a professional, and therefore held up my transition, by almost two years. I didn't want to be like 'THEM' after all, did I? And now, what do I do? After facing so many trials and tribulations, coming out to friends and family and actually setting into motion my transformation, did I gain sympathy for the 'trenders'? No, I started blaming them whenever someone didn't understand trans, or had outlandish misconceptions. When someone thought me 'just confused' or, and that actually happened with one of my friends, asked me if 'that's what tumblr said'.   Thank you for this video. I will try to be more considerate and empathetic in the future. In the end, what do I care as who or what they identify? As long as nobody gets hurt, it is no business of mine, just as I don't want anyone to make it their business what I do or don't have in my pants.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Why not both, transgender and transexuals? Transexuals, people like myself and Ms Tumbles and madam Points, people who experience dysphoria and transition or have a desire to transition to the correct gender roles and medically change hormones or whatever feels right. I don't see why transgender people, transexuals and enbies and gender fucks have to endanger that or undermine transexualism as a medical condition. Transgender people do experience dysphoria, but it's a disconnect with societal rolls not the body, just like transexuals but they don't have to have dysphoria. I came out as non-binary (back in my day they didn't call it enby) when I was 16 (4 years ago) and at that point I was severely disassociated with my body which was a good thing I didn't have a lot of physical dysphoria at the time but still felt social dysphoria and needed to transition my name and pronouns and presentation to feel ok. The physical dysphoria slowly surfaced for me so I wasn't always transexual but I was always (or as long as I can remember) transgender. - side note I've never understood the difference between transgender and transexual but now that I do I really like the idea of having a distinction between the two, but to be clear one shouldn't be prioritized over the others.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Brilliant, loved it!  I don't think striving for a scientific theory to validate the identity of people is a good thing... interesting: why is this even necessary? because rational-sciencehumping-society? However I think one can account for 'trans-phenomenon' with modern meta-psychodynamics (routed in psychoanalysis). According to this (if used adequately) all forms of gender (and sexual preferences) are created by an INTERACTION of biological, psychological and societal 'factors'. This interaction varies individually and culturally which is why there are many forms of gender and sexuality. However this doesn't validate or devalidate trans. Science, if understood properly, is actually incapable of giving or taking value to anything; it's all just phenomena. But maybe it implicitly valuates in relation: if cis-males, Tiffany, Justine, Tabby and Maryland are all just different phenomena built of the same building blocks in different quantities and arrangements, then there's no reason to devalue anybody. Saying that something is more 'real' because its a diagnosable psychological disease makes no scence. In the end if something is a psych-desease or not is decided by cultural standards and if there is enough suffering involved, not by biological markers. So all Tiffany does is saying, that she's suffered and society decided to include her suffering in the DSM, which is fine, but does it actually validate/devalue her identity? Maybe Tiffany has suffered more than Tabby or Maryland. Maybe suffering is also crucial to identity. But if suffering is the only thing that validates an identity then people in first world countries have generally weaker identities than ppl in third world countries. That's my opinion. If you disagree: I'm open for discussion.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This video is so ridiculously bad and uneducated that it actually makes me cringe. It's so blatantly biased to try to push that transgenders arent a thing without actually looking into why the 'third' gender shit existed in other cultures or what they did, all the while making the 'truscum' out to be another uneducated idiot that doesn't even research their own facts to learn the basis for them causing them to look like a total ignorant asshole. while making the 'NB' person basically a dick but you're supposed to like them cause they seem to be educated when they aren't but since they are calmer they clearly won right?. maybe touch on the fact that before gender dysphoria, it was something else. transsexualism. gender dysphoria isnt a newage concept by any means and even before the term transsexualism there were cases of people like that.  trying to say that no theory is true is just inaccurate. however, you can be empathetic and compassionate while still going along with actual facts and evidence, rationality and medical observations.  Yes, I do think its important to recognize trans tenders as real and separate from trans people. but its also important to recognize them as human beings able to do, dress, and act however they want. dehumanizing anyone for any reason is a huge no go. someone not being actually trans or not is no reason to treat them poorly or hate them.   but god this video really makes me cringe.

"' I pity you Tiffany Tumbles. I pity you, because you don't think that you're real until a man in a lab coat signs a prescription pad, and I can't imagine what it must be like to have so little confidence in your own reality.'  Damn that line got me. I'm not trans, but I'm black and I spend a lot of time trying to convince white people that black people are just as human. And I a lot of people ask me, 'Why does it matter if white people think you're trash?' And the obvious answer is police brutality and job discrimination. But for me, even without that, just getting comments about how I must be stupid because I'm black or things like that have really bothered me. Even if I still can get a job, and live in a safe neighborhood and don't have to worry about the police harming me. Even without all of that, I desperately want validation from white people, to acknowledge that I'm human. I meet individuals who do, but I run into a lot of people who just don't understand that we are people. When Baltimore said that Tiffany needs validation of her reality from a person in a coat, it hit hard. I'm the same way, just for me that person is white people.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The arguments made against those who aren't in favor of non binary genders don't really address the scientific studies that show the differences between male and female brains. Female brains and male brains generally have different varying levels of great white matter ratio. That's how we know that male and female genders are actually a thing.  Contrapoints just brushes It Off by asking the Blaire white parody what a male and female brain looks like and that you don't need a brain scan to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Just because you don't need a brain scan to diagnose gender dysphoria doesn't somehow invalidate those studies.  It's a non argument because they don't just diagnosed you straight off the bat by what they tell you. hey just give you certain things to try and do along with therapy to try to objectively see how it impacts your life. So why they might not need brain scans there still a process you don't just say you feel like you have gender dysphoria and then the doctor automatically like diagnoses you with it and suggest you get surgery immediately.  Try to actually debate somebody instead of trying to set up a Straw man to make what your arguments look like they're better than they actually are. If you identify as nonbinary I ultimately don't care but don't try to force other people to accept your self diagnosis is just as valid as what any psychiatrist can do. Non binary genders aren't listed in the DSM-5 nor are they listed in any other credible scientific source. It's not to say that down the road scientific research can prove that non binary genders are legitimate thing and not just a fad but that is yet to be seen. To argue we must accept that non-binary people exist just because they say so is like expecting me to believe that you can fly when no one's looking.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Sure, you can call all categories of depraved deviants 'Queer', and that would probably be OK with most, but 'trans' is just not a catch-all category. Actually It is more singular than any other kind of incitor of popular hatred I can think of.  Trans people are already very insecure, barraged by misdefinition, mockery, and invalidation as they are. TERFs relishing their 'ounce of power'. What they do not need is Mardi Gras GQ's blurring their embattled identities and providing evidence for the 'Delusional Freak' theory, harbored by many 'ordinery plain volk'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"To my experience, a lot of gender-nonconforming girls women are free to perform their way, is exactly because they are cis and never had to give the ounce of a thought about their gender identity and because they had a supportive family so they never felt the pressure of society to conform.  Same for a cis boy I know who never felt the need to no-homo his behavior while having a bromance with his best buddy and wearing pink shirts.  I have to add that this is Germany and not the US tho.  At least this explains why trans women tend to overperform so much.  I feel like I actually don't even get to feel 'threatened' by much non-binary behavior in my immediate surroundings. Like, no obviously non-binary behavior in my surroundings. Some queer people who play with their sexual identity.  I don't know how I would react to a non-binary person in full honesty, I'm afraid I would go full rude stare for ten seconds or so if it was the first time.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"in my opinion, the existence of nonbinary identity doesnt invalidate the '2 genders' claim. 'man' and 'woman' are social constructs based on social and behavioral norms in a given society. to be nonbinary is to express qualities of either gender, or neither gender. nonbinary identity is indeed relevant to the gender discussion, i consider it a valid identity. however, i believe that the abscence/presence of both genders does not constitute a unique gender.   regarding the notion that you need dysphoria to be trans, i can somewhat have an open mind if someone were to tell me that, even without the dysphoria, transitioning would be undoubtedly important for that person. because this discussion brings about the question 'if you dont have gender dysphoria, then why do you need to transition?' transition is a fundamentally life-changing process that is irreversible if implemented surgically. so there would have to be a benefit to transitioning as opposed to not. what i mean is, would not transitioning be healthy for a given person? perhaps they dont have dysphoria, but would they be more mentally healthy if they did identify as trans? if there isnt any reason to suggest that transitioning would be good for em, then why do they need it? thats essentially where the whole idea of transtrenders comes from.   i understand that you dont believe there needs to be a reason to be...yourself. but you can easily define who you are based on who you arent. if you're in a state of being who you arent, then that implies a need to transition to become who you are. Jake must become Jackie because she is not Jake.  if you are already who you are, then why would you need to change? if Tim doesnt need to become Tiffany, then why would he want to?   overall, i think the most important aspect that defines the need to transition is time. it takes time to figure yourself out. it takes time to reach a conclusion that a given person is trans. not gender dysphoria. time. it takes time to make such a big, serious decision about your life. without time, big life decisions may potentially become fleeting. like a fad.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Gender is a social construct. Gender identity is how a person relates to gender as a construct. I am non binary and for me that means i don't have a strong connection to being male or female. How do i know this? Observation. I have seen cis women in my life enthusiasticly connect with their women hood in ways i can't relate to. I was devastated when i hit puberty (thought i had cancer but i was just growing breasts). I image people who feel a connection to their bio sex feel similarly to how i feel about my race. I am a black person and i feel very strongly about my caribean roots. I do experience social dyphoria but the biggest thing that indicated to me that i was non binary was the euphoria i felt when I discovered there was a word that could explain what i felt. As someone living in the UK, i am serverly afraid to be open with everyone about my gender and have been for a few years now. I feel as though non binary peoples words have been twisted and we have been miss represented to a point where its difficult to be open.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This was a great video Natalie! Being gender fluid masculine, I've often found myself having to explain myself to trans men/women who believe I don't experience gender dysphoria like they do. Though you mostly speak of NB people here I've found more understanding from them then trans men/women in terms of how we present. Me and my nonbinary friends try to go for an androgynous look. Though they prefer they/them pronouns, I prefers he/him while not minding she/her on occasion. Where my dysphoria arises is when I am presenting as a man one day and I miss enough cues to be labeled as a woman. The same happens when I need to use my legal name in public (one that is very feminine). But there are sometimes when I like to dress feminine and identify as a women and I pass fairly well. I guess my issue is just trying to find a good balance. I'm coming to terms with my identity. I have support from friends and family so I'm in a good spot.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There was a comment I lost track of, so I'll just respond in its own thread, about 'What makes you FEEL your gender?' And speaking as a computer nerd bibliophile RPG fan who also happens to be a cis male, I generally feel male when I'm talking to other people in person who treat me as male. That's about it.  When I was younger, I thought it just a good exercise in imagination to just be able to assume a woman's point of view in books or RPGs when those were the characters whose stories I followed.  I generally don't identify my gender online, and if someone assumes my gender incorrectly (which happens surprisingly often if you just have a female cartoon character avatar or dare to back a feminist side of an argument), I've never felt a reason to correct them.  Of all the things I believe about myself, gender is one of the least important to me.  If asked to describe myself, I'd much rather talk about my talents, my interests, or what I do or have done than gender, since describing myself as 'male' seems so unhelpful.  Descriptions are for narrowing down possibilities, and saying I'm male is like being asked where my car is parked and saying 'in the northern hemisphere', since it narrows me down to half the population of Earth.     And no, none of this is to 'claim' a status as non-binary or anything 'to be special', I accept being generally treated as male, it's just that I don't understand the sheer level of hostility around the whole concept of gender to start with.  (And I also don't mean to belittle anyone who has to struggle to actually be identified the way they desire by any means, or say I can't understand why someone who has to overcome some oppression because of their background would incorporate that as part of their personal identity.  That said, I think declaring yourself 'feminist' is more important than declaring yourself 'woman', even if the latter is what formed your path to the former.)    I remember seeing all these polls in forums for computer RPGs like Elder Scrolls, and only about 40% of players would be willing to play the other gender, even in a single-player game where there's nobody there to give you shit for being a girl in a game.  When I started talking about it and why people were so wrapped up in the fragility of their identities, I would invariably be shouted down by a chorus of people who couldn't conceive of what was wrong with the 40% of players willing to 'degrade themselves' by playing a character of another gender (well, OK, so they were assuming it was men playing women, because women players don't exist... or at least admit they do if they don't want to take shit for it).  I even had one guy claim to be a doctor telling me how wrong it was for me to act like gender wasn't such a big deal because he tells patients that have testosterone insensitivity syndrome that they have the wrong gender until they CRY!  (Which just makes me wonder... what the hell is wrong with this guy?  You're so caught up in the CHROMOSOMAL DETERMINISM of gender that you'll yell at patients that they're wrong for not being a gender they've never tried to be until they cry just to satisfy HIS idea of gender conformity?!)     I also get the sense it has something to do with how we view 'the other gender' as well.... Maybe it's that I was born to a feminist mother, and I've generally adopted positive female role-models, grew up having friends that were girls and traded Transformers for My Little Ponys, and been willing to take shit defending feminism that I'm not too scared of being called a girl?  I get the sense a part of it is a fear/disdain/hatred of 'the other side' that drives the all-consuming existential terror that someone might think a male has 'feminine' traits.  Why would it be an insult, otherwise?  Why are men scared to play woman characters even in RPGs around a tabletop with people they know or in single-player computer games if they didn't find it inherently demeaning?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"natalie, im an idiot. i don't want to put energy into drawing my own conclusions from the debate. i need you to TELL me what to believe, because im a cisgendered woman who doesn't understand this transgender vs trender debate. my default is to sympathize with everyone and simply accept everyone for who they want to be, but the points brought up by Tiffany in the second half really made me question that. how can dysphoric trans people ever be accepted when society needs a definition for everything? is it too optimistic to assume that stargendered people will ever be accepted? where people like Baltimore are making a statement, Tiffany was experiencing real and true discomfort and in a world that's so close minded shouldn't that take the priority? idk, i really just want everyone to feel valid for whatever they want to be because i understand that, like you said, it's experimentation and there's nothing wrong with that. so i know how I will conduct myself, being sympathetic and respectful of all, but what about the close minded bigots out there? what are you going to tell them? this video was very good but i feel like it was missing a proper conclusion to tell me what to believe because the points on both sides were good and like i said, im a cisgender women that can't really relate personally to either side. but i love your channel and you're clearly woke af which is why i trust your opinion, so id appreciate it if you could use the character that is Natalie Wynn to conclude videos and make the message it was supposed to send very clear to people like me, thanks!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It would be interesting what the reasons that some persons end up being transmedicalists are. I think that this whole gatekeeping thing contributes really much to this whole concept of transmedicalism. As was mentioned with Tiffany as an example, the whole identity as a transgender person is based arround the diagnosis of gender dysphoria. But under what circumstances does someone get this diagnosis (of gender dysphoria) in the first place?     Most countries are very gatekeepy, which means that in order to get medical treatment the patient has to go through a whole bunch of tests to prove that he/she/they is trans. This process can be very traumatizing because one has to (!) disclose personal experiences one would not even want to tell to their diary. But they have to do this to get the label 'true trans' from the doctors in order to get the medical treatment like hormones. Not just that, but real life experience tests as part of the gatekeeping can also be very traumatizing while at the same time they do not really contribute anything valuable to whole pre-medical transition process.     It is understandable (for me) that the trans patient, in order to cope with the traumatizing process, is beginning to identify with it and its absolute goal. Which means that the whole identity and therefore most of the self-consciousness of a person gets tied to the diagnosis of gender dysphoria. After all the pain one had to go through, not only the pain of gender dysphoria, but also the pain of the diagnosis-process, this diagnosis will be held high to the sky as the sign that it is done. Maybe one has invested very much (life-)time to get this very important diagnosis just to get the much needed medical treatment. Persons who don't experience dysphoria but are also in some sort part of the trans community are therefore classified as not valid, because they don't go through the agonizing diagnosis-process.   If this whole unnecessary gatekeeping process wouldn't exist maybe there wouldn't be a concept of transmedicalism which is used inside the trans community to prove who is really trans and valid and who isn't. What are your thoughts? Am I interpreting too much in this whole concept?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Even if scientists prove that a 'gay gene' exists, they won't buy it, they might shut up, but in their hearts they won't accept it, because it's profane. Same thing with transpeople, transtrenders, queers, intersex, etc. because the idea that non-binary people exist to them is human degeneracy at its apex. So trying to find an explanation for trans and gay people is a distraction, they are making you run on a treadmill of their own design. Even when you reach the top they will come up with another reason like defending the family, protecting women in bathrooms, protecting the identity of lesbians or gays, it doesn't matter, the arguments are made up. And even if you win and make them shut up, the spore will remain waiting to florish under a reactionary wave of backlash. Because belief, especially those fueled by a feeling disgust towards the profane, is undebunkable and long-lasting. I don't know how to deal with this. I guess we save as many people as we can, though that isn't very comforting. Sensational lies in the internet travel faster than the inconveniant truth.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think gender is the conjunction of a social construct and biology. The roles were created to provide a framework to help society deal with the average differences between men and women.  I will agree that those boxes do not fit everybody, nor do they completely fit anybody.  I am concerned that destroying the boxes society wide will have consequences that are bad. They've existed for a very long time, and the societies that had spaces where the boxes didn't apply had just that. Creating a space where the boxes don't apply in our society seems like a good idea.

"Yeah, I lasted 17 long minutes, but it was as I suspected.  Contra's least insightful video.   Genderqueers constantly bully and invalidate transsexual men and women, and in an act of projection, misrepresent the mere fact that we are not OK with their bandwagon-jumping as _us bullying them._  They often even ban the term 'transsexual', saying that both transsexual men and women, and people who don't actually transition, must all be blurred together under the label 'transgender'.  You've swallowed the idea that we're some sort of oppressive elite.  Us.  Us, for fuck's sake.  It's as if people thinking of getting a slight tan started presenting actual black people as oppressing them for pointing out that they have specific experiences as actual black people that the others don't have.  And then saying that 'black' is an outdated term and that everyone ranging from actual black people to people wearing spray tan on the weekends can only be called 'coloured' now, and don't you dare be a coloureder-than-thou bully.  'THE SANCTITY OF BLACKNESS MUST BE DEFENDED'.  Ya see, if you write it in all-caps and sarcastically use religious language, that _proves_ that it's silly to be clear about things and everyone who might roll their eyes at a glitter beard must be an alt-right bimbo a la Blaire White.

"Look, even if an individual hasn't had their brain scanned, neurologoscientist Robert Sapolsky has brought to public attention the fact that in cases of serious gender dysphoria upon death an examination of the patient's brain shows anatomical similarity with the sex the person says they are as opposed to the sex they were born. This clearly shows that when the feeling is strong, pervasive, and evident from an early age it is typically because the phenomena is a real condition. That said, the recent explosion in people claiming to be non-binary cannot be explained by this. The trenders are not just being pretentious twats, but actively serving to undermine the legitimacy of those with the real condition and endangering children by getting them castrated for playing with dolls or something horrible like that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Gender is biological AND psychological/behavioral AND social. However, biology influences psychology/behavior and social interactions but is only influenced marginally in return (e.g. when social interaction modifies hormonal levels). Psychology/Behavior and social interactions strongly influence each other.  There is an argument to be made, that a lot of the push back experienced by transgender/non-binary people stems from the fact that they try to directly influence their social gender, when that part of the identity is created by the interplay with other people. You can directly modify your behavior and sexual identity (from a psychological point of view) and through medical intervention can modify your biological identity - that's for you alone to decide. The social aspect, however, is constructed in collaboration with other people - and their reactions can be different from what you imagine. That's where 'passing' actually plays an important part if you are aiming for consistent male or female identity - and for most adults those two are the only genders they can help to construct a priori. While I'm sympathetic to the fact, that a mismatch between the social and the psychological/biological gender causes dissonance, it's not for the trans-person to decide the behavior of others as it's not for the others to decide the behavior of a trans-person.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This video is fantastic and philosophically unassailable. However, major glaring problem:  It sidesteps the neurogical and endocrinolical arguments entirely, in favour of using transmedicalism as a kowtow to pathologism via psychiatry.  Before Paul McHugh's long shadow and before John Money's social constructs disaster, being trans was basically treated like an intersex condition that wasn't fully understood yet. It was the erasure of intersex people - John Money's theories followed by Paul McHugh's policies on surgery for intersex infants being to erase them entirely - and the cleaving of trans issues from intersex issues that led us to where we are today.  I have sensory problems with my gender dysphoria. These 'feelings' are *sensations*, and the problem is some rando who wants to feel special knows all about having feelings, feeds off the sensationalism being trans is painted with in our society, and decides the use of 'feelings' applies to their rampant emotions and not to physical sensations. There's a reason the same people who cracked the code for phantom limb are researching transgender people.  And that's just the thing. Validation is nice and all, but that won't make me feel better. Better treatment modalities, better research, more research, etc are going to make me feel better.  I won't call the blonde chick a straw woman, because honestly the mean girls BS is how a lot of us cope with having to drink every time someone gets all philosophical about this issue, but the blonde chick is also a victim of philosophical rhetoric because it puts one character crying at home and two of them in front of a vapid pundit instead of in a doctor's office or research lab getting better care for trans people overall...

"other people have pointed this out (and i'm pretty sure this interpretation was one of the intentions of the vid) but here's my two cents: trans womanhood can best be described as a combo of biological, psychological and sociological factors, but that doesn't just apply to binary trans people. it can also be applied to nonbinary trans people and even cis people, as well as explain why someone like rachel dolezol isn't valid. here, lemme demonstrate: a nonbinary person:  psychological: doesn't id as strictly a man or woman sociological: navigates society as someone who doesn't fit into those roles whether they're out or not biological: gender dysphoria and euphoria is a physical response to the mismatch between one's gender and one's assigned gender (be it physical, mental or social)   and if i'm being petty, even when you don't account for intersex people, everyone has chromosomes they inherit from their mother and their father. everyone has an x chromosome they got from their mother and is one chromosome flip away from being xx or xy, so 'biological males' are, genetically speaking, half female. rachel dolezol, meanwhile:  psychological: she may very well id as a black woman, who the hell knows. sociological: you can make the case she navigates society as someone who believes she's a black woman but the social aspect of race isn't just how you're treated, it's also the legacy of how your parents were treated for their race, which rachel lacks because biological: she don't got black parents. genetics is super complicated and not clear-cut and we're all one race the human race but from a practical perspective, rachel has 0 black parents while every nonbinary person has two parents who are different genders.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

This may seem progressive until you realize that, above all, what they absolutely can not tolerate is any appearance of similar-looking genders being romantic with each other or any non-conforming gender identity in a society with no room for a spectrum.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"you covered a lot of different aspects of the conversation regarding trans. i have been pondering about a lot of these elements, and i think there is a link between the physical, psychological, and sociological aspects of being trans.    but i unfortunately have only resolved so far that while connected, these three things are seemingly only vaguely important to each other, because of obvious contradictions as somewhat pointed out by this video.    everyone has their own philosophical take at what aspect, or even interpretation of gender, is the most important to base our society's standard and understanding upon.    it's probably seen as a weak answer, but perhaps it's just better to accept all genders as valid, and just try our best to accommodate and be respectful, even if it may seem alien, weird, or uncomfortable for us, but just imagine how much more alienated and uncomfortable those who do legitimately identify a certain way must feel when you try to tell them they are being fake.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thanks so much for this video, Nathalie. I'm in the super-early days of transition and have to say my precarious self-identity often feels threatened by non-binary gender expression (it's threatened by lots of other stuff, too for that matter). If the very concept of gender is undermined, then my transition feels threatened at the same time. I don't care whether dysphoria is experienced in the classical sense, and don't really consider myself a transmedicalist, but if the idea of dysphoria is taken away then so might our options to treatment be snatched from us, as well, or so my paranoia tends to go. At the same time, you've managed to create empathy for all the players in this transgender Socratic dialogue. Thank you a million times. xo","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Another person's expression of their femininity/womanhood has absolutely zero impact on my expression of my gender, or my life at all, really. And that's incredibly liberating!

"'How do you know your brain is female if you haven't seen it'  How do i know i have autism or depression without having physical proof.  Theres a certain set of symptoms. This makes me feel angry. Just cause u haven't seen it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.   I think we should differenciate between the two people we see here. Transsexual and transgender Or something Idk how but Dont consider sex and gender the same.  If someone doesn't have disphoria why change? If it everything works then why change it? Thats like taking medication you dont need? I dont get it. Would love if you would adress that.  I mean Gendernonconformant can do whatever And nonbinaries exist but they have genderdisphoria too. The ones i dont consider transtrender.  Also twospirits aren't nonbinaries they just fullfill a third genderrole.  Besides if you dont wanna fit within society's genderroles why even label yourself as transgender or nonbinary in the first place. Just be. Use whatever pronouns you want. I personally pefer to just be refered to by my name but i dont care. Idk man. Doesn't mean im nonbinary tho.   Also centrists dont work like that. They're more like a mixed back of candy. Some right leaning candies and some left leaning candy. I go whereever the sceince goes.  Dont call yourself trans untill u know for sure... just like anything else. If you had a thought that maybe you're adopted you dont just assume you are. You try to figure it out before you tell anyone you're adopted. Plus if you experience 'gender euphoria' maybe thats a sign you had some kind of disphoria but didn't realize in the first place.  Idk what the sceince behind genderdisphoria is but im sure sceince will figure it out eventually. Plus i think theres sceince behind being gay too. We just need to find it. Life is chemical reactions. Theres reason with the madness.  Also isn't it kinda sexist to say that men need sceince behind everything? Does that make me a man?

Even if you're confident in having a broken leg, you still need a doctor. Even if you're confident in having autism or adhd, you still need a doctor's word. Especially considering you think your biology to be a mistake and that you are the opposite or non gender that most of your biology aligns with, I'd say getting a doctor's idea of the situation is more effective than just 'understanding yourself'.

"Miss Contrapoints, thanks for another excellent video. I don't always agree with you but you've definitely made me look at things from different perspectives. For one I will definitely be more patient with people, especially teenagers trying to figure out their gender. Such an important decision as transitioning must take time, unless we want a ton of detransitioners as a result of very young people, or just adults whom are in a bad place in life making those decisions on a whim. I think you need to live for at least a year as the gender you believe fits you before even thinking of such things as hormones and corrective surgeries.  I do however absolutely disagree with you about the definition of trans = being displeased about your societal role. I believe that kind of thinking is damaging as it pretty much goes against everything feminism has been working for since the very beginning of the movement. When I think about societal roles it involves everything from what you're wearing and your body language to wether you prefer to be a stay at home parent or a breadwinner (to clearify I don't think anyone of those is superior to the other).  While I do believe some personality traits are more feminine or masculine than others, such as women in general being more nurturing (as much as many will hate me for saying this) I hate the idea that anyone who happens to posses traits not expected of their sex should be considered trans. Not to mention that some gender roles, as most CP-fans can probably agree with me on are pretty damn harmful, such as equating femininity with submissiveness (something that I will subscribe to over my dead body).  It really worries me that some trans women seems to believe that they need to be obedient, extremely soft-spoken and meek in order to be accepted as women, and I really understand that this interpretation angers and frustrates cis-women who've been trying to break out of those roles for ages.  I guess I'd fall under the definition of transmed since I believe that being trans is all about feeling a disconnect with the body you were born with, even though I do believe that that disconnect can vary from person to person.  One person may feel satisfied with hormonal therapy while one may need to go through all corrective surgeries to alleviate their dysphoria.  To clarify, I do believe that you need dysphoria to be trans but I also believe that the struggle of non-binary people is very real. In fact I even believe that non-binary is a necessary label for certain trans people who like Ash Hardell for example only needed top-surgery to alleviate their dysphoria as well as intersex people who feel perfectly comfortable identifying that way.  No matter what though I do agree with you that patience and compassion is important,  and that we should show the people who are still trying struggling with their identity respect. Being a teenager or in general out of balance is hard enough as it is without the rest of us being well... shitgibbons about it :).  PS. I apologize to anyone who reads this if some of my points are unclear. There is so much more I want to say, but this post has literally taken me hours to write and I feel that it's going to take me all day if I continue. May add to it more later :)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is the biggest strawman I've ever fucking seen, this is the absolute worst, first of all because you made the person arguing against fake gender identities a conservative - which is not reflective of those of us who don't want to indulge Cis People invading our spaces. People making up new genders that have no meaning beyond an aesthetic to force their way into the community is Harmful because they reinforce the stereotypes about transgender people that cis people use to hurt us and they don't suffer the consequences of it, Trans people do. A Cis person's right to cover themselves in glitter and call themselves a fucking cloudgender or whatever directly negatively affects the rights of Trans people because other Cisgender people will SEE the Cis people fucking cosplaying as a trans person and use that to tar us all with the same brush, predominantly because as you missed out in this video - most fucking mogai or tucute types are only 'out' online and so again they don't suffer for what they're doing, Trans people who have no choice but to be out do . Not to mention how many people like this claim oppression for their fake identity explicitly so they can shout over Trans Activists and usurp our rights movement, dramatically slowing down our ability to challenge the systems of oppression that we face so they can yell at people for not calling them Xim and Xer. People like this aren't calm or rational, people like this conform fully to the angry shouting tumblr fourteen year old stereotype. This practice of identifying as what the fuck ever and making shit up also negatively affects trans youth who want to come out but are made to feel as though they can't JUST come out as Female or Male, it pressures them to not conform to a binary even if that's who they are to begin with. The whole thing about not wanting to put people in boxes is bullshit, because I literally know many trans people who wanted to start coming out but were forced to not just come out as Binary because that was treated as bad by these people. They weren't allowed to express their identity in the way it manifested because people like this insisted that they be more 'creative' and told them that being any kind of binary was bad while they were at a very vulnerable stage.  If we had Trans Rights already, if we had equality and normalisation for Trans people, then this would be fine. As it stands, this is an appropriation of Trans Identity by cisgender people who want to feel special. Most of whom retain their birth pronouns and present as their assigned gender ANYWAY, so they are overtly cis while claiming to be some form of Trans as well. I am really fucking disappointed that you refused to present both sides of this argument, and frankly as you are a middle class white Trans Woman who participates in Drag I'm not that fucking surprised that you'd rank Performative Aesthetic on the same level as actual identity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think one of the things that's helpful to me in this context is figuring out what the harm will be if [group] does [thing].  In this context, let's say that some number of people identify as trans or nonbinary at some point but ultimately decide that they aren't.  What harm will be caused?  Well, some of those individuals may go through medical procedures that they later want to reverse and that may leave some side-effects.  Some people will see them as evidence that trans and/or nonbinary people don't really exist.  (Though, IMO, there's an awfully big overlap between people who would interpret it that way and people who privately doubted trans and/or nonbinary people existed to begin with.)  But, telling them they're wrong to explore will likely hurt people who really are trans and/or nonbinary, depriving them of any room to explore that.  It also hurts the movement as a whole by dividing it against itself, which really only benefits people who want to deny rights to trans and NB folks.  I think different parts of the conversation should be led by different people.  A person who hasn't experienced gender dysphoria probably shouldn't be leading the conversation about transitioning for the purpose of alleviating gender dysphoria.  (In the same way, I, as a childless-by-choice woman, shouldn't be leading the conversation about providing better maternity leave.  I can be an ally of course, but I shouldn't lead the conversation about it.)  Conversely, the conversation about being nonbinary or genderqueer should probably be led by people who experience that, rather than people who are trans but identify solely as male or female.  I think the challenge often comes in that through some mix of privilege, luck, and platform, it's really common for some members of a community to end up with the platform to talk about certain issues which they don't really experience.  For instance, I first heard about non-binary people through a video made by a queer producer talking about gender and sexuality, but who wasn't nonbinary herself.  That in and of itself isn't bad--but it can sometimes lead to many people knowing about a particular thing only from others talking about that thing, and not from the people who are that thing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Both clearly have value in the lives of the ones using them, and one doesn't invalidate the other.  Words surrounding identity have the power to create community, to reflect on the self.

"The 'truscum' I've seen talking about the importance of dysphoria are generally concerned about whether insurance companies are going to consider transition a health need or a fashion trend. Personally, I believe they're onto something there. I believe nbs exist (obviously they are right there) and that they are as valid as anybody else, and that you don't need to 'hate yourself' in order to experience dysphoria, but if your pronouns and biology are preferences so light that you really are fine either way, and that you require absolutely no outside help to perform this beyond surface recognition, insurance has no reason to pay for surgery and hormones, or even therapy. We do need to make a distinction between people who need medical or even psychological help with gender dysphoria and people who just want to be themselves and not be bothered.  I think it's not completely ridiculous to say that Tiffany Tumbles was feeling shamed by Glitterbeard when they said she must hate herself due to dysphoria, and could be cured by an attitude change.

"Gender can still be psychological and we can still get a fairly good read on it without doing an MRI. Just like psychologists can diagnose all sorts of medical conditions without doing brain scans, but if they were to do one, we can be pretty sure they'd see the results they predicted.   I don't think this invalidates non-binary identity though. I would guess, and to be fair this is a guess, that non-binary people do not have brains that are patterned like women or like men. And we don't have to say why it is that some brains are like this and some aren't, as interesting a question as that is. We can just see that it is the case (again, guessing).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I have read a medical study, some time ago, that actually validated all genders, including non-binary and agender, stemming from the gendered brain theory. The argument was that white matter patterns vary greatly between individuals. Sure, trans women and cis women present very similar patterns amongst themselves, that differ violently from trans/cis male patterns, and viceversa. But those are just the two ends of the spectrum. A virtually endless variety of intermediate patterns exists (I mean, have you ever considered how complex the brain is?), and consequently, a virtually endless variety of genders, made only more complex by the intersections with the separate but contiguous parameters of sexual orientation, and gender expression. This conception highlights dramatically, in my opinion, how devastatingly stupid it is to reduce all of human experience to two genders and one sexual orientation. Sure, as Natalie says, who cares about your brain, no one has ever seen it. But to some degree, scientific validation may be useful and helpful to those who are still trying to figure out their place in the spectrum , or have already done so but find themselves ostracized by our society. I'm a cis woman, so if I'm over-medicalizing the trans experience I apologize, but I find these discoveries utterly fascinating and don't think they will necessarily narrow down our visions on gender, if anything they will widen them. And I can't help but feel like it would be a shame not to make the facts-don't-care-about-your-feelings crowd face the reality of science being on gender-non-conforming people's side.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Since it was such a big question in the video, I feel compelled to share what led me to 'believe in' transgender being a thing.  I've never felt much like my gender myself, so my conclusion was that it didn't really exist. Much like a TERFs I believed gender was completely a social construct and I fought long and hard to not be defined or constricted by my gender.   I didn't understand how to combine this world view with trans people, because the concept of trans people relies on gender being real and valid and important, and that kinda what I was fighting against. Or at least that what I thought, I guess in retrospect I guess I was fighting against sex being constructive. I didn't realize the difference between sex and gender at this point.  A few things changed it for me. First I heard I podcast with radiolab about a person who'd switch gender unvulentarily from moment to moment. They could walk into the shower and feel fine about being a man, but switch before they walked out of the shower and experience crushing disphoria when they saw themselves in the mirror. They changed mannerisms, to a degree where other people could tell the difference. They lost their wife in this process, though they were still good friends.  I dunno. Hearing about this, hearing a person experiencing this shift in gender, and some scientists confirming it.. It made me think that there's something about gender being real. That apparently there *is* something in the brain that perceives itself as man or woman. It's not just a construct, there is more to it.  Years went by and I stumbled upon first non-binary and then trans youtubers. Hearing their experiences further confirmed to me that, though I don't feel attached to my gender, it really is important to some other people. I remember the Shit trans people say video where they describe, jokingly, dreading injecting a needle into themselves every day. Fuck. Y'know.. That's tough! If you're willing to do that to yourself, even though it's super uncomfortable, there's a reason, y'know?   It reminds me of people realizing being gay being real and not a choice when a gay person asked them 'Why would I choose this? I can't get married, I was excluded from my community why would I choose this?'  After I'd watch trans youtubers explain how important their gender was to them, I started asking my friends about their gender. Like, I feel like I'd be fine with being called 'he'. But my somewhat conservative when it comes to gender roles, male friend that I talked to said he'd feel uncomfortable being called she. He asked what it was like for me to not feel like that. And my quite sjw female friend said she wouldn't be comfortable being called he.  Well shit. Gender is real. It's just a spectrum. Some people, like my friends, really do feel uncomfortable not being recognized as their gender. I just don't. It doesn't have to either be real or not real, it can be important for some and not others.  I've realized that that doesn't make neither I, nor cis people attached to their gender, nor trans people invalid. Gender is important for some people, less for others, regardless, sex shouldn't have to define you. But if it makes you more comfortable acting in a gender conforming way because it confirms your gender to those around you, that's okay. It's just also okay not to, and people shouldn't be forced to act in a certain way. Gender and gender expression is different, and it's possible to fight for the right to gender and gender expression and against restrictive and forced upon gender expressions as well. We don't have to fight against each other, it's possible to fight for all.  Damn. I'm writing this on my phone on a festival, I'm sorry for the format and repetition. I have a hard time editing it.  My point is. I wasn't convinced through facts or stats or performance. I was convinced by conversation and representation. Just like so many people have with being gay. It's real. I don't know why or how, wtf is sexuality, but there's been so many reports that there's no doubt in my mind that homosexuality is real. And now, with more exposure, I feel the same with transgender and gender in general. It's real. There is enough people reporting it that I can't imagine it not being real.  Puh. That was a lot. But I hope my story might be an insight into how it a possible to convince people of the validity and realness of these subjects.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"A few points about performativity and psychological reasons for gender.  1. On the argument about drag queens and screen actors playing different genders and if they're trans because they're performing, isn't there a difference between performing socially and performing for entertainment? Drag queens and actors don't necessarily live their lives as non-binary or women or men, they perform temporarily for entertainment. Doesn't performative theory differentiate between that and performing socially, living one's life as a binary or non-binary gender?   2. The difference between psychologically 'feeling' as a certain gender and 'feeling' as a Norwegian cat, for example, is that gender is uniquely human (as BaBooTube Videos pointed out in another comment). So just cause you feel like a cat, you can't psychologically be a cat cause you're human. The same for attack helicopter or whatever strawman joke transphobes like coming up with. So they psychological aspect (or 'theory') is certainly valid.   3.  Why does Justine say gender could be social OR psychological? (I'm ignoring biological here) Isn't there a connection between social roles people are expected to perform and the psychological impact they might have? Even language (pronouns) is a social construct and if one psychologically cannot identify with a certain set of pronouns (he/him or she/her) due to the social implications of said pronouns, one can choose a neutral pronoun they're comfortable with. That's a psychological impact of a social structure.   That being said, you're right. There is no need for any theory (social, biological or psychological) to prove the validity and existence of all trans people. You're all valid and all deserve headpats and rights!  (Also how much does Baltimore Maryland charge for an hour of therapy?)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Hey, so even though it isn't a required thing to be trans, non-binary people can also have gender dysphoria. As someone who literally tried to starve their tits off because of that, I can say dysphoria is not limited to being binary. And being trans is not limited to having dysphoria, it's not my experience and I don't fully understand it but it doesn't need me to understand it to be real. I really like this video but I did want to add that being non-binary doesn't necessarily mean no dysphoria. Because it seemed implied to me but likely wasn't meant that way. Again. Non-dysphoric trans people are valid. Dysphoric non-binary people are valid. Binary trans people are valid. We all valid and as a trans masc dysphoric person if I can ever grow a beard I'm going to totally do glitter beard.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Or maybe we don't have to decide that it can't be medically explained, and it could be possible that it's just a thing that hasn't been medically explained yet?  Seems the most likely to me.  Science always makes a lot of botches before it finally hits the nail on the head (part of its great strength).  Humans are slow at discovering stuff.  Give us a few lifetimes to catch up!  It's a thing that is clear and obvious of being the case to enough people to believe true if you're not being an asshole, but it is also a thing waiting for proof just like all the other things that are more allowed to wait for proof and less demanded to somehow solve instantly.  Science'll figure it out some day.  It doesn't matter when.  In the meantime, be us.  That's my take on it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Some can have sex while in drag and some detest the idea saying it opposes their sexuality and identity.

"Thank you for this overview of some of the opinions in the Trans community. The more I hear from Trans people about their experiences, the more correlation I see with the G&L fights of the 70s/80s and the LGB struggles of the 80s/90s.  Yes, Sexuality and gender are separate things. However the struggle is the same, and that's why I strongly believe that the LGBTQIA+ community absolutely has to embrace any and all that need the umbrella for safety.  But nil desperandum. Women fought for legal equality for over a hundred years, People of Colour for slightly less, Lesbians and Gays for 50 or so. Yes, we're not there yet for any of them, but the time to widespread acceptance is falling. Hopefully this means that you'll start seeing the results within your lifetime.

"As a cis guy, I know my view on the matter probably isn't as accurate as those who have lived the experience of being trans. And my opinion on the matter is not exactly something that should be viewed as important. But, I would like to ask why, to the question of 'why are you transgender?', there can't be a 'some or all of the above' answer. If trans-medicalism is something that can be shown, but not in all trans people. And it is the same for gender dysphoria and some or all other views on why transgender people are the way they are. Why not look at it like a convergent evolution kind of thing. A lot of different creatures have learned to fly, but birds and bats have evolved independently from each other. However, there is some overlap, as they both use their forelimbs to fly. Insects have very little overlap in how they fly with those two groups, but no one who has seen a bee will argue they don't actually fly.    While it is not that impotent what i think on the matter, because you are who you are. I think you are quite right in stating that there does not have to be a reason behind why your identity is what it is. I mean, cis people like myself don't need to have a reason to be cis. No one has look at my brain to see if i am truly a cis male. But, people are interesting. And i do think some will be convinced by scientific discovery more easily than just stating you are who you are.   I hope I did not make anyone uncomfortable with any of my statement, as this is not my intention. If i did, please, if you feel like doing so, don't hesitate to explain how, where and why I am wrong or insensitive, because i would like to know.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Gender dysphoria is generally a result of a neurological disconnect. You can suffer from a disorder that may cause symptims similar to gender dysphoria, but that is treatable. Good therapists don't merely diagnose gender dysphoria but diagnose where it most likely stems from, and if it seems there is no cause  (hormonal or environmental) what so ever, then that leaves to conclude that the reason must be biological. So the biological argument absolutely holds up. Surely it would be much more beneficial to take brain scans and if this was costwise a reliable option then absolutely I would say go for it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

My reading of it is that it's a critisism of dogmatism wherever it's found in ideology, even in 'sjw' discourse and it harkens back to Natalie's 'Do I feel like a man or a woman?

Obligatory I'm cis disclaimer, but I can see problems with all of them, much like the ones pointed out here. So when someone says 'Hey I'm trans, use they/them pronouns' I just say 'Sure, I can do that'. I've never felt the need to make someone validate something that has almost no effect on me. I mean, what makes me a woman? I couldn't tell you. I just feel comfortable with it. And because I came out the womb with a vagina, society doesn't make me justify my gender. Maybe what we cis people should do is extend that same courtesy to trans people instead of demanding a single, unifying explanation from a hugely diverse group.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"One thing that I am curious about when it comes to non-binary identities is how people choose to define why they're non-binary. Often times I see people defining themselves as non-binary based on the feeling that they don't fit their assigned gender. This interests me particularly because I have come to the conclusion that gender is socially constructed insofar as it describes a set of socially expected behaviors. Some of those expected behaviors may be biologically informed but that doesn't mean they all have to be. As an example, there are social expectations and pressures exerted on men to not express emotions, to be breadwinners, to be protectors, and even to be aggressive. These behaviors are now recognized as being potentially harmful to men; they're labeled toxic masculinity and there is now a movement to redefine the expected norms to exclude expectations of potentially negative behaviors and to include a broader range of expression from men.   This brings me to my question; based on what criteria exactly are people deciding that they don't 'fit' their assigned gender? If gender is essentially a set of stereotypes perpetuated by social expectation, it seems to me that defining yourself as not identifying with the gender stereotypes and therefore not that gender is legitimizing that a gender should be defined by the current stereotypes and social expectations. Particularly in the case of men, this seems counter-productive to the project of ending negative stereotypes.   All of that admittedly leaves me in a weird place because I believe that despite my own feelings about what makes someone a 'legitimate' trans/nb person, it's not my place to lay those judgements on others. I'm also pretty sure there are legitimate reasons for someone to identify as non-binary instead of pushing for broader norms within their assigned gender identity despite not being able to personally conceive of such a reason myself.   On another note, another point of concern for me when it comes to the transtrender debate that I don't feel was really addressed in this video is that there seems to be a social aspect to being trans that goes beyond what you'd expect based on just wider acceptance. Young people are especially more likely to come out as trans when one or more of their peers do. There is also the phenomenon of gay boys believing they are trans until they determine they're actually gay. A lot of this also seems to be mediated by online talking points that are, to put it lightly, less than nuanced when it comes to the discussion of what it means to be trans. This is where I think your argument about trans-medicalism should work great and that not expecting people to medically transition would alleviate the problem of mass numbers of young people needlessly transitioning, but that doesn't seem to be the common narrative among young people and there is a growing contingent of people who advocate that not allowing children to transition is a form of child abuse.   Would love to hear anyone's thoughts on the above issues and if you think I've been ignorant in some way. Much love and peace.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I relate intensely to the main takeaway - you don't need logic to justify your identity. You are who you are. I mean, I don't really know who I am anymore because every signifier of my identity I held onto has slipped away, leaving only an empty rote performance of what people expect from me that crumbles a tiny bit every day, and a series of habits I'm too tired and anxious to get rid of. and I know who I would like to be but there's a nagging voice saying that's not who I am, that I'm just trying to run away from myself. Except if that were true why is what I think I want a recurring theme going back to childhood? but I've been running into that demand for logic and reason - I need a pile of proof that I am what I think I might be. I need detailed observation, I need data, I need evidence, I need ARGUMENTS.   Sometimes it's creepy how much Natalie's different characters reflect my conflicting thoughts. Tiffany Tumbles is a lot like the recurring thoughts in my head telling me I'm not, it's just online exposure, it's just a fetish, I could never do it. and, damn, Baltimore does make me uncomfortable. I support and would defend nonbinary people forever, but my brain doesn't work that way. I don't GET it. I accept and love, but the psychology eludes me on a purely emotional level. and it doesn't work for my problems. I wish it did! But the ambiguity terrifies me. But Baltimore is mostly right. I think Natalie makes them purposefully a bit off-putting on a performance level, to not tip the scales too much, but it's still pretty clear - at least this is probably what would be healthy for us to believe, if nothing else. Everything else fucks us up worse one way or another, from transmedicalism to performative theory to biology. Better to just shrug, throw up our hands, and say 'yeah, this is who I am, no I don't really get it either, your guess is as good as mine, but I'm still valid dammit'.   anyway, back to logic, and to justification. When you think about it, it's an absurd thing to have to justify your identity. You justify your position on issues, on art (if you want to, it's optional), on the weather. but on you? nobody in the fucking world knows you except you. If you're wrong about yourself, you're also the only one that can say that for certain. You can choose to take advice from other people, especially if you discover your internal monologue is self-destructive and leads you to self-harm, but even when you're telling lies to yourself about yourself, you kinda know who you are anyway, when you get past a certain age. If you're twisted up, doing a performance, not being real....somewhere in your awareness you know what's up. and if you're a kid you haven't even had the time to develop an elaborate series of defense mechanisms, so yeah, it's even more bullshit to say kids don't know what they are.   I mean, I know the truth about me. I have no idea what that truth will look like, when it comes out. but I know now that I'm not going to worry so much about providing a set of justifications to people. and if they ask me, did I always know....of course. But the problem was, I was treated as very smart because of my early developed verbal ability, and I learned too early that things should make sense. Things should have rational justifications. maybe it should have been some kind of clue to me that I was bad at math early on - logic....wasn't actually my strong suit. I was a circular peg shoved into a square hole. I let binaries govern my thinking, because everything seemed scary and chaotic (everything still does, I perceive reality in a really disordered, hazy way, I think, which REALLY doesn't lend itself well to playing the Smart Boy.   I need the Baltimore mindset - my feeling of myself is valid, the things I want are valid, my feelings about every aspect of me are valid, and their validity is axiomatic. It's Cartesian, cogito ergo sum, bitches. I start with the assumption I know me, and from there, the world.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is an easy second favorite of yours, close after the Gender Crit 1. It mirrors and expands upon a subtle, emotional conversation I have with myself every day.  I would really love u to head on address the financial privilege of 'passing'. Because yr make up game (and face bones, and wig budget, and wardrobe) is getting to the point of leaving (prob not an insignificant number of) (lower middle class) trans girls a bit dysphoric and sad. Obvs you doesn't need to apologize or anything for being gorheous, but it's worth bringing up, especially when we reform health care in 2 years.  Without diving into it (yr video on facial feminization surgery was sorely lacking in privilege discussion), it *can* come off as a sort of showing off, which u would be the first to admit yr doing lol. But still. The number 1 thing holding trans back miiiiiight be the culture of pervasive social and physical violence... Or it *might* be shit, regressive health care. Both have had quite the effect on me.  For instance, it's much more helpful to transition to get hair removal than it is to get bottom surgery. It's also much more helpful to get FFS than bottom or top surgery. But hair removal and ffs are not covered by 2 different (pretty decent, relatively) insurance plans I've had. So essentially major functions of physical transitioning I can't afford. And I work as a full time morning news producer and part time caregiver.

And you portray all of these different points so well! And I love how you don't make an official winner in any of the arguements, but leave it up to people to decide, therefore challenging your audience to do something much harder than simply watch. You force us to think for ourselves.   The character Justine though, she seemed the closest to you from what I can tell. Would you consider yourself of the same gender identity as her? Do you ever get help with your hair/make-up/sets/lighting? Or is it more of an all 1 woman show? If you get help, do any of your helpers have youtube channels?

I just cry sometimes knowing I will never be a man lol.  idk why i rambled about all that, I know no one cares. it's just nice to be able to say sometimes I guess. and I appreciate the opportunity to just be able to mention that truscum ideology fucked me up. anyway, love your content, Natalie. your videos always crack me up and it makes me happy whenever I notice you have a new one up. your perspective and ability to explain things and just how very 'real' you are is great and I super appreciate it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I want to put you in a box because there is a lot of information in the world, and not having some form of filing system is fucking retarded. If you don't want to belong in any specific box, fine. You get tossed in the miscelanious box (also known as weird). It's not a big fucking deal and you literally asked for it. I am just trying to keep the influx of information going at a brisk pace.  Two, you can dress however the fuck you want, for whatever reasons you want. For instance, i dress in earth tones, and greys. I keep my style in sync with the setting I am attending (tshirt and jeans for a bar, suit for fancy restaurant etc). I also like big pockets and boots, when i can get away with it. I do this because i want to be left alone, I like to carry lots of tools and in case of emergency I have proper footwear. The drawbacks are chicks dont notice me, and i find my clothes a bit boring. I wear the clothes despite those downsides, because i think the upsides are worth it. What I don't do is whine about chicks not moticing me or how boring my clothes are. Stop wearing bright colors or glitter if you dont want bad attention, or keep wearing it if you want good attention, but don't bitch about the consequences of your choice, that's all most normal people care about dude/girl/my fellow american (whichever you prefer idk your pronouns and trying to meet halfway)  Also centrists, my dudes.

"There's an argument I haven't seen mentioned here, which explains some aspects of the trans community that I've never heard here.   So those people who always piss themselves over the XY chromosome might be SLIGHTLY right. In that maybe some part of gender comes from the genes. However, what they fail to see is that the Y chromosome cannot actually go through meiosis (not normally, at least to my knowledge.) This means that the largest built in protection for genetic loss in our cellular repertoire is actually incapable of working. That's also why the Y chromosome is so much smaller than the X. We have substantial genetic isolation. With isolation, we should expect divergence. We would end up with a much broader range of basic drives. We simply labeled ourselves with two gendered pronouns, because we're a bit dim, and we don't make good choices.   Well, thanks for the decent videos! Loved the robot thingy.

"I'm a transmed (or truscum if you like) myself. I do certainly feel that I grew up with a need to be masculine and not be feminine at all, but thankfully I've grown out of it. I think I often forget that I had times where I didn't really feel enough like a man and found comfort in non-binary identity myself. I have no doubt that some amount of people are socially transitioning as some sort of trend, but thanks to this, I've got a different perspective. Instead of trying to root out people I don't think are 'valid' enough, I should probably be trying to help people explore their gender. And if they're wrong? Hey, at least we've got that cleared up!

"This video really speaks to me. I was out as a transwoman for nearly a full decade and I was every bit the Blair White stereotype. I would throw other people/groups whom I deemed 'weirder' than myself under the bus amongst friends because I was desperate to be accepted for myself. I've always been pretty feminine, but I also felt like I was trapped in a sociological cage because I was constrained to acting feminine in order to maintain my 'transness'.   Your videos make a huge difference, contra. Voices like yours are what helped me to realize that the social problem isn't non-binary individuals, or just transwomen who go a day without shaving every part of their body (because let's be honest, for some of us it's a full time job)  - the problem is the people who can't accept that everyone really is different. We come in all shapes and sizes, with unique temperaments, personalities, and so on, and not only is it impossible to separate us out into neat little boxes like 'he' and 'she', it's also ultimately pointless. The only way we can change things is to be out there and exist.  Anyway, I identify as non-binary which I guess means I have the distinction of being able to say I was the 'self hating tran'. Heck that. I'm out, I'm proud to be who I am, and I'm happy to be able to say I love and appreciate people for who they are and the things that make them unique. Keep up the good work, all of you - that means those of you in the comments, too, whether you're actively producing content or just existing as the awesome people you are out there in the real world. <3","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"My question to the people who say 'being trans is having dysphoria, dysphoria is a disease and transition is the cure' is this: if there was a pill that would, assuming you're a trans woman, turn you into a cis woman instantly, would you take it? I can say with some certainty that you would answer yes. Well, what if that pill would turn you into a cis man? It would remove your dysphoria too. Maybe you'll say yes just to prove me wrong, and maybe to some of you the suffering of dysphoria is so intense that you would actually take the pill. But most people I have asked this question struggled to answer. I wonder why is that? Why, considering that your suffering with dysphoria would disappear either way, one option sounds like a no brainier but the other takes you a second. Why, once again assuming you are a trans woman, 'turning' into a man is an unthinkable scenario. Maybe because there's more to being trans than just dysphoria?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The way I see it, sex and gender can be like this. Biological, Neurological, Psychosocial, Cultural, Sex, Psychological Sex, Gender Identity, Gender Expression Male, Masculinized Brain, Male Gender Identified, Male Clothes   A debate to wiggle NB people into this is to do the following.   A: Answer me this. Why should an intersex person have to be forced to identify as a man or woman? B: Well, they shouldn't, but only intersex people can be non-binary then. A: That's weird, you sound like the people who say only females can identify as woman? B: But non-binary genders are made up! Man and woman aren't! A: That's incorrect, actually. All gender (gender identity, roles, expression [not sex or psychological sex]) is 'made up'. It's socially constructed. Social differences between the sexes are not necessary. I can easily imagine a society where everyone goes by they/them pronouns and uses the same bathroom. B: Oh, but society has it this way, why change? A: Because changing will allow for many more people to feel happy and comfortable. They're just as equal and deserving as you are to have comfort and enjoy society! B: But if you don't have dysphoria, you're not trans, and many tumblr trenders say they don't have dysphoria! A: Not all dysphoria has to be dysphoria with your biological sex. Have you gotten dysphoria by being called the wrong pronouns or wearing clothes that don't align with your gender identity? Yes, you probably have. That is because your mind interacts on a daily basis with your body, environment, and the world. It is possible for people to not have Biological dysphoria (with body), but it is possible to have social dysphoria (pronouns/bathrooms) and even cultural dysphoria (clothes, roles). B: Well what if you didn't have biological, social, or cultural dysphoria? A: Then you would just be a person who is comfortable with their sex, comfortable being called whichever pronoun matches their sex, and comfortable wearing whatever clothes culturally match their sex. B: WELL THOSE PEOPLE AREN'T TRANS! A: You're right. Sounds to me like I described a cis-person. Congratulations, you're able to differentiate between cis people and trans people! ^u^ B: Well, fine but if they can identify as neither or both genders, why can't I identify as a crocodile? A: Can humans have crocodile brains? B: No. A: Is crocodile a social role? B: No. A: Is crocodile a type of cultural differences between the sexes such as masculinity, femininity, and androgyny? B: No. A: So can you identify as a crocodile? B: :thinking: A: What? B: Why are you talking to yourself in the comments of a ContraPoints video? A: Well, I used to be a Truscum just like you, hating non-binary trumblr folk and 'trenders' and all that shit. But then I got woke and realized that things are a bit more complex than I initially anticipated. B: Oh, anything you want to say to the current Transmeds in the community? A: Yes. B: What would that be? A: *Don't be a fucking Truscum so that I won't have to type this shit next time I see someone being Transmed on the internet LUL*","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I knew I wasn't the only one who feels dysphoria but I don't hate myself or body. I feel weird among other non-binary folks because I don't feel like dressing andro, changing my name to one of those so called gender neutral names that's really a male name, binding, or taking hormones. Like, I'm just not male or female and the amount of qualifiers you go through for 'acceptance' as truly non-binary is upsetting.    That being said, there are a lot of trans personalities on social media that are harmful to the trans community because they participate in a whole lot of drama and tea spills and/or they are expressing their own dysphoria as the only genuine trans experience. There are people with unhealthy attitudes and ideas in every community and we all need to do our part to keep each other safe.

"Ugh so Contrapoints making straws and fallacious arguments all the way. It's going to be long. I had to make three parts, the rest is the seventh and eighth comment below this comment. :)   The reason why transmedicalists insist on dysphoria isn't for opression point but to remind people what used to be transsexualism. Aka a medical condition that hurts and kills people. Non-binary sex doesn't exist, so there's no non-binary gender. Third genders accross the world are boxes societies invented to put LGBT or intersex (which aren't a third sex but a medical condition) or GNC people, that doesn't make them a new sex. Please check any non-binary category around the world, it's pretty clear it wasn't a magical third sex. This point, you can prove to me that I'm wrong, by showing me proof about a third sex. What would convince you? Most transsexuals conform to their gender identity. Nobody is really free to do choices in a society, and that includes people like the bearded non-binary character. Hell, even transtrenders are actually closed themselves into a label to get accepted by their peers. Thinking that just because you dress in a different way, that makes you 'freer' than the ones who actually conform, is dumb. Wanting to conform, or not conform, to society isn't a choice. Why did you dress in a different way? Are you sure it's not for some societal reason? Like 'not conform to the idea society wanted you to be'? Lmao People who think aren't under social pressure are really fooling themselves. We are a social creature, we need attention and to be liked. That's a normal biological thing that happens.   We can't actually check people's brain to get if they are female or male, because it's all about averages. In studies, trans people's brain are IN AVERAGE closer to the brain of their identified gender rather than their birth sex. But for individual brains, we can't see this, because the human brain is very diversified. It proves the existence of trans people being different sex-brain related, but can't be used to diagnose an individual. Would be nice if you actually read researches before you make comments on them. :/ URL (you see overlapping points corresponding to brain being more typically female or male to explain my point). So as I've said, it proves that something is up on the category transsexual, but it can't be used to diagnose and individual. Also, we don't look at people's brain in general to diagnose them. Depression, schizophrenia, PTSD, DID, are all stuff we could see on brain scan but you never see anyone making you having one for it. So not only it's a gross misunderstanding about science and neurobiology, but also just plain stupid as an argument. Moreover, when you take HRT, your brain chemistry change and makes you have a brain closer to the gender identity you identify as, so Tiffany has indeed a female brain, because she's on HRT, it's just logic.  Brains are sexually dysmorphic. A really quick search on wikipedia can answer you on this : URL   Gender dysphoria is about wanting to be the opposite sex fam. If you're non-binary, you don't want to be the opposite sex, erego, you're not trans. That's the diagnosis, there are four criters that are 'of the other gender' (and I assume it means the opposite sex because non-binary sex doesn't exist, so having 'primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender' can't really mean anything else than the opposite sex, as much as they tip-toe around it because of the pressure to be PC).  'A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender' URL   And like, it's clearly not perfect, and clearly therapists aren't very educated on the matter (as usual), so yes, most trans people tends to diagnose themselves before. The criteria should be changed, and a lot of other things should be changed. Studies showed that trans people showed more dissociative disorders prior to HRT, and stuff like this. Dissociation is never accounted for the diagnostic of gender dysphoria, even though it clearly IS a main part of it (being 'disconnected with your physical sex'). So yes, it relies on your own feelings right now, because there's nothing really available for a test or a clear criteria that hasn't been made yet. So does a lot of mental illnesses unfortunately.   Baltimore's feelings aren't legit because they feel non-binary and that's not an existing gender. They feel like they're a non-existing thing. Could be caused by psychosis (schizophrenia has sometimes delusion about being another thing/being/sex) or just the fact that they got so into trans stuff that they began to feel that way, or they're maybe just a binary trans person who's very confused. In any case, taking the medication transsexual people needs (and why they get the dysphoria diagnostic to begin with) won't make them non-binary, it won't help them by definition. So yes, Tiffany is right, it's nothing like them, by definition. That doesn't mean Baltimore shouldn't get help, just that it should be a different help than for trans people.   I don't get the next point. Of course Tiffany has some confidence about her own diagnosis otherwise she wouldn't have gone to see a psychiatrist to get the gender dysphoria diagnosis to begin with. But psychiatrists are supposed to be there to make sure that there won't be any regret, and look for any other reason as to why someone would want to change their birth sex. They are many : psychosis, traumas, social influence, for example. That's a real shit, it can happen, and the tribute to pay is very heavy if you made a mistake because you litteraly change your body. No going back to that after. That's why therapists exist to begin with, or why doctors exist to begin with. We can't diagnose ourselves correctly because we lack the professional distance to see the big picture, which is actually normal and good.   For the millionth time : gender dysphoria is a mismatch between your gender/brain and your body. That's it. You don't need to hate it, you don't need to be H24 on pain. But yes, that's all as to what is transsexualism. It's a neurological condition that makes life harder. That doesn't make it rotten or won't make trans people unable to be happy ever, but it does suck. That said, you can be proud and celebrate the fact that you're still alive and made it until today, despite homophobes, stupid people, gender dysphoria and transphobes. One and the other aren't impossible to put together.   Part 2 is below. Very pretty and well played video... But really misrepresenting everything. :/","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Since I've gone rounds with this with some TERFs: gender is always what you say it is, and if you agree with your body and your social placement, you are cis. If you do not agree at all, you are trans. If you switch or are ambivalent or don't like the options at all, you are some form of NB/GNC. It proves why you may or may not have dysphoria (as some do not) and why NBs exist.  TLDR: contrapoints is correct. We just are. That is how it is.  My only quibble: you can be NB and trans. NBs are not their AGAB, and may have strong dysphoria about their body or how they are treated. They may even transition to look less like their AGAB.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Ugh the 'I need hormones to validate my identity' thing is too fucking true.  I ran into some hardcore gatekeepers when I was first questioning my gender identity in my early twenties, and basically swallowed a bunch of ideas that were going around on Livejournal at the time like, if you were REALLY trans you'd want to be super masc, if you were REALLY trans then you would be suicidal from gender dysphoria/completely non-functional... I was (and still am) really into BL/yaoi comics, and back then there was this attitude of 'you're not really trans, you just read too much BL and think you want to be a bishie' which like...knowing what I know now about just how many BL/slash fans are trans...  Maybe we're attracted to male/male comics about pretty androgynous boys BECAUSE we're trans!! ever think of that, huh??  Anyway my point is that being treated like a trans trender drove me away from exploring my gender identity and into a period of trying to force myself to be as femme as possible for like 7-8 years and it made me miserable as fuck. 'Guess I can't be trans, I have to be a woman now' --me, circa 2013. And now here I am over 30 and old and just starting to figure out my shit, and I keep having fantasies of like 'what if I had explored this stuff when I was fucking 15 instead of now.' Kids now have SO much more leeway to explore trans identity, I'm jealous as fuck. I didn't even know non-binary was a thing. When I was a teenager I had people dribbling poison in my ear like 'just because you want to be a guy doesn't mean you're trans' (literally people said that).  And now with the purity politics going around Tumblr and fandom spaces...there's a certain crowd that says if you're a woman writing m/m erotic content, you're like, fetishizing gay men or whatever the shit (it's bullshit seriously), and if you try to explain like no, this has always been an expression of gender identity for me, you'll get accused of not being a real tran. Because, of course, a real tran would medically transition. See here URL for the kind of bullshit people say about m/m fiction all the time. Popular m/m author says they're trans or changes their mind about their identity, everyone accuses them of being a fake. Ugh. Add that to the 'bisexual isn't really queer' attitude and we have a full house.  There absolutely needs to be a space for being confused. I avoided queer spaces all my life because I always felt I wasn't 'queer enough.' I'm not 'really trans' (NB don't real), not really gay (bisexuality doesn't count amirite), but I don't feel comfortable living a straight cis life, either. So I lived my fantasies through fiction and writing. Accusing people of being 'transtrenders' is exactly the kind of shit that kept me from figuring myself out for over ten years (though they weren't using that word before).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a baby tran who went through a very toxic truscum phase: thank you. I tried so hard to not to be associated with tucutes that it made me hate myself for just being trans. I tried to prove myself to people who would never listen to me even if I brought up the whole brain argument thing. But then I just let go. It took a lot of time to rid myself of my toxic mindsets (sometimes I feel myself judging my actions unfairly) but I'm getting there. This video made me more confident that there is more to being trans than being miserable all the time. The ending really stuck with me when Justine was talking about how maybe trans people just exist, like gay people. I know it's just a theoretical and we can't be sure, but I hope that's the case. It's tiring to blame each other for oppression that's caused by transphobes. Their minds won't be changed if we don't stand together.

"I'm an anti-SJW, and I've been a fan of yours for a while. I think people should be whoever they want to be and dress however they want to dress, but I also think things that can be explained rationally, should be explained rationally. I found myself agreeing far more with Tiffany Tumbles, even though she's obviously made to be dislikeable. The way I see it, there's nothing wrong with not conforming to a binary of gender roles, but that's different from being 'transgender' in the sense that you have gender dysphoria. I see it as two issues being grouped into one, and oversimplified. I think what the world needs is more clarity because transgender people only look crazy when there are multiple conflicting identities shoved under one umbrella. Being gender dysphoric, as I understand it, is a psychological condition. I agree with 'Tiffany Tumbles' that this is a mental disorder, simply on the basis that the issues that come with it cannot be solved entirely through social acceptance, but that being functional with this condition requires treatment (i.e. gender reassignment surgery, hormones, etc.). 'Disease' is, unfortunately, stigmatized, but calling it a condition or disorder, I think, is only rational, since it causes problems regardless of cultural context. 'Transtrenders,' I think, refers to people who simply don't align with gender roles & stereotypes, which I deem to be a mixture of biological and cultural. For instance, a man who wears a dress, or a woman who relates more to men and spends far more time with them, or, on the very slight end of the spectrum, a woman who would rather take a more dominant role in her partnership, and take a job while her husband stays at home. These are all things that defy gender roles, but they are not gender dysphoria, because the problems that come with these things can all be solved completely by societal acceptance of individuals. As all individuals are different, whether gender roles are social or biological, there will always be outliers to the gender norms, and by extension, everyone will be somewhere on that spectrum. People who present themselves with nonbinary gender roles may face societal scrutiny in more traditional settings, but it's not the same thing as having gender dysphoria, which is why I think it should be called something different than 'Transgender.' Ultimately, I think making this umbrella of acceptance so wide is just confusing, grouping transexuals, homosexuals, and gender-queers into the same group of LGBTQ+, when I don't think transgenderism is a gay issue, and I don't think gender nonconformism  is a trans issue. I think they're totally different things, hardly even related. Sure, I think everyone should feel free to express themselves how they want, and I also believe everyone's somewhere on the queer spectrum--but that doesn't mean there's 76 different genders, nor do I think that means there are infinite genders, because if we're talking about 'gender' in the context of transmedicalism, and the prevailing notion is that there's a notable difference between male and female brains, then that necessitates two genders. I think everyone should be more accepting, but also talk about this stuff more rationally because when it's reduced to feelings, it loses its respectability.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i knew there was a reason i felt so weird about all the hate that someone like Gothfruits (YouTuber) gets.   there's a set of rules, yes...and nobody wants to admit they're arbitrary, in the sense that ALL rules are technically arbitrary. and  EVERYTHING is frustratingly impossible to prove objectively.  (except the fact that anyone who shares the 'it's ma'am' meme...well...the only thing lower than their IQ is their EQ)  there is no way to prove that Gothfruits isn't who he says he is, as much as that seems to undermine the set of rules that (being rules) lend credibility and legitimacy to the rule-followers.  but, the problem clearly ISN'T that we're such a rational society that we must fight anything without an airtight explanation. obviously that isn't the case.   i mean, you don't see people spending endless hours combating everything they think is incorrect...only when they feel EMOTION do they do so...and thus choose to use facts (or 'facts') as weapons.   thus, the problem with society isn't that we're so rational it trumps 'feelings'...  the problem is that we rely so heavily on 'facts, rules, and order,' but only when we are angry enough to want to weaponize these imperfect tools. just as Baltimore said.   and honestly, the only real solution i can think of to this silly black-and-white thinking is...total anarchy ;)  did i have a point with this? i don't think so. except, if you're one of those people who concern trolls the comments of people like Gothfruits telling him to stop hurting real trans people, consider that his existence, regardless of whether it is even valid, or whether validity is a valid concept, is not the problem.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I thought this was a great argument, and that Justine had it right when she said gender is 'psychological , or social, or biological'. Right there, that's it. You can't separate the three (psychology is reducible to biology but we aren't close to have the technology or understanding to do that, so we need to consider  both. Biology is not a one way flow of info from genes to behavior; genes influence behavior, but this is mediated by the brain and body, both of which are plastic and respond to external inputs. Indeed gene expression is itself influenced by environment... This is bio 101 and contrapoints knows this) .

"I don't think there can ever be a real explanation of What Is Trans without a clear definition of what is gender, and more importantly where the divisions lie.

Because I'm six foot two and strong limbed, because I have a forceful personality and zero patience with fluffy mindedness, because I like science and video games and suck at sewing. In any other era as far back as I can see, my physicality and personality would have earned me freak status. So I find myself asking, what is womanhood? What is gender? If changing not one iota of my self except the year in which I exist can effectively alter the definiton of my personhood, what value has that definition?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I can't help but feel like Justine and Tiffany's conversation approached its logical conclusion, but never actually arrived there. Justine was so close when she compared gender to loving one's children, but then abandoned the line of thought... Gender isn't biological, psychological, or socially constructed--but it can be examined through those lenses. I think (and please argue with me if you feel otherwise because I want to hear other opinions on this) it really just comes down to radical subjectivity. You scrutinize deeper and deeper until terms like 'male' and 'female' become absurd categories without any meaningful distinguishing parameters--it's just an expression of pure subjectivity; a something out of nothing; the Cartesian cogito. I think it's time to ditch the Judith Butler and hop onto Lacan and Stirner. 'Il n'y a pas de relation sexuel'. Lacan posits that the basis of 'hysteria' (in the psychoanalytic sense of the word) is essentially a radical questioning of interpellation (i.e., calling into question the ways in which one is made into a subject by various forms of social authority). The hysteric asks, 'Why am I what you say I am?'. Well, I think it only makes sense for gender expression (particularly in the case of queer or non-cishet) to be the 'hysterical' affirmation of one's subjectivity: 'I am what I am because I feel like I am and I say that I am, and fuck you if you don't like it. I don't owe you an explanation. I don't need to justify myself.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The problem with gender being social is that we are saying that biological females who do (stereo)typically /historically male things are of the male gender and that biological males who do (stereo)typically /historically female things are of the female gender. If anything, the social categorization forces people into boxes even more than the accurate 'there is only biological sex and there are only two biological sexes.'   Gender is a confusing term that is used to confuse people about reality and we should frankly stop using it. If you're a male who wants to live like a female, go ahead. That doesn't change your biological sex but live the way you want. Same if you're a female who wants to live as a male.

"There really are biological bases for both gender and sexuality, this has even been demonstrated in mice and other mammals. It's not 'male' and 'female' brains, it's a specific brain region that is responsible for mating behavior. One part of mating behavior is who you are attracted to, and the other is how you act to get a partner. And yes humans have built whole gender roles out of that cause well, we're really good at making shit up. There are biological basis for everything, I mean, we are our brains. And yeah that includes a parents love for their child (it's oxytocin, among other things). Evolutionary psychology is all about this. But I mean, there are also biological reasons for why people are transphobic, or why people identify as cats, or why people murder other people, so that's not a good argument anyway! It's just appeal to nature!  An actually good argument is a psychological one. I, as a trans man, have vastly improved wellbeing post-transition, and that is also scientifically verifiable. Like you can actually do studies and show that when trans people transition, they become much healthier and happier. And that should be enough! If there were studies showing that 'cat people' have higher wellbeing when they are referred to as cats... I'd refer to them as cats! The biological basis doesn't matter, and it won't matter till we find markers so precise that we could actually make diagnostic tests out of them. Till then, the best explanation I have for why I am a man despite not living as one for most of my life is 'it feels right'. And really, does any cis man have a better one? Doubt it. So that's why it is enough for me.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm actually surprised you didn't bring up one huge point truscum always forget: Non-binary people DO experience dysphoria! I'm non-binary. I've been non-binary for years now. And I experience dysphoria. I agonize over my body hair, feel gross in dude clothes, hate my shoulders, cringe every time someone deadnames or misgenders me, the whole shebang! It's all there! But I'm still not a binary transgirl. Medically transitioning is something I'm considering. But I don't want to transition into a woman's body, I want to transition into a non-binary body. According to truscum, I'm simultaneously trans and not trans. I'm non-binary, which to them is a funny way of saying non-trans. But I also have dysphoria, the one thing that, to them, makes a trans person. So, confronted with the existence of people like us (And there are plenty! Every non-binary person I've met experiences dysphoria on some level), what can they even say?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Even as someone who is nonbinary, though in the closet offline, I found myself agreeing with a lot of Tiffany's sayings, and even if I agreed with a lot of what Baltimore said too, it felt as if Baltimore was just a personification of what people love to say transwomen are, just men in dresses. As it did with Tiffany, I felt the knee-jerk reaction to feel uncomfortable by him.  But Justine was right, upon closer introspection, I was uncomfortable because seeing someone like them makes it so easy for straight cis people to look at and think we're all crazy. I wanted the validation of the majority, so I was willing to judge another person of the minority. I found myself agreeing a lot with Justine, though not all her arguments are sound proof against Tiffany. At the end of the day, what does it matter who identifies as what, so long as as a community, people are there for them to figure themselves out. Is it so wrong to let a person like Baltimore grow a beard, put glitter in it, and rock a dress if by doing so it makes them feel more comfortable as the person they are?  In the end, this video was a great catalyst for looking inward at my own internalized transphobia against those who don't fit cleanly and neatly into the boxes of male-identifying, female-identifying, and androgynous in a way that Baltimore isn't but in the way fantasy elves usually are.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Even though I really like studying sexuality and how homosexuality works in biology and societies (as a gay myself) I must say I find that last bit about << needing a theory to be gay >> very interesting. When gays were not as accepted by society, we tried to explain that it was valid by scientific theories (it's in nature, you're born this way, it's genetic, etc.). Maybe that's what's happening with transgender people. Some are trying to validate themselves to the common cis person who needs a theory to believe it's << ok to be trans >>. Maybe in a few years, we won't care for theories anymore.   Though I'm still worried about the detransitionner, for themselves. I almost did that mistake and I'm really afraid of what would have happened if I had done it. The bit about transmedicalism forcing people to medically transition... I think it depends on the individual. I've seen people who think you don't need dysphoria to be trans that say you should experiment with hormones and go on hormones even if you're not sure. On the other hand, I've seen transmedicalist people who believe you shouldn't medically transition unless you can't deal with not medically transitioning anymore. Hm. Tho yes people like Blaire White do say you need to medically transition if you can to be trans and that's damaging. The lesson in all of this I guess is don't group people's  ideas together because they pretend to be part of an ideology lol.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

That's an argument I've heard her make before and I more or less agree with it. But I feel like that kind of invalidates the idea of 'other' genders. To actually BE that gender, you have to assimilate to those gestures and that 'social role.' Those social roles are determined by the culture, and in our society we literally don't have the social roles of man and woman. The concept of another social role simply doesn't exist at this point in history. How can you identify as that gender, or social performance, if it doesn't even exist in your society?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"My grandma used to say, 'It takes all kinds,' whenever she'd see interesting folks out in the real world. She never put too much thought into the hows or the whys, and instead worked to make that person feel welcome and comfortable when engaging them, or providing quiet empathy and acceptance otherwise. 'It takes all kinds of fruits to make a fruit salad.'  I kinda get peoples' need to categorize and order and label everything, and put things into neat and tidy little boxes. Helps to cut back on panic and surprises. Helps to set expectations accordingly. People love shortcuts. But at the end of the day it doesn't really matter who fits where according to whatever definitions are being spun up this time around. There's no need to make bullshit over-complicated. Be happy to be part of the salad. Be thankful for the experience, and try to make the experience better not just for yourself but for those around you too. We're here only for a limited amount of time. Maybe we shouldn't piss all over it?  I'm about as cishet as it gets. That cement has dried long ago. I get that I may not be able to fully understand or appreciate feelings of dysphoria (unless we're talking about deep-level BDSM and why I identify more as a slave fetish object than a regular Joe and how that means I'll never be able to form a normal meaningful intimate relationship with another person), but I would never tell anyone that such feelings are invalid. No one died and made me the arbiter of genders and I'm definitely not here to oppress anyone. I just hope that I can establish something like gender understanding and preferred pronoun usage smoothly and quickly, because I'm likely more interested in the other ways I can make you feel comfortable or help you accomplish your goals. I'm less interested in your gender and sexuality and more interested in if you can play Soul Calibur and/or roll a nice jay, honestly.  PS. Cyber-Natalie is super hot and I have a strong desire to see more of her decked out in latex, pretty please! Keep up the awesome work, Natalie and crew!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm pangender, I'm closeted in Ohio a terrible state to be trans in. I pretend to be fem because it makes people more comfortable and keeps me hidden. I feel comfortable with multiple pronouns (he/she/they) but afraid and uncomfortable with only playing fem. It's so exhausting that I don't buy clothes or dress or act conforming and confirming to how my brain/body feel about myself. Outside of the apartment I'm a girl and I do girl stuff and i'm cute and adorable, inside the apartment my partner uses various different pronouns for me because she accepts me. All my friends do too in private, when I told my family I didn't feel comfortable about my gender they threw me out.    I have dysphoria, I have dysphoria about my body not conforming to how I feel about myself, not dressing how I want, not getting to be called multiple gender labels just one all day every day. It's exhausting and painful and makes me feel miserable. But not everyone has dysphoria, some people embrace it and embrace themselves and I don't know how but they're so powerful. I've met some trans people like that, and it's crazy and I respect them so much. I aspire to one day feel that way.    There might be one or two but the reality of it is there are multi-gender/alternative gender labels all over the place and has been happening for ages. I'm first nations but don't use the label two-spirit because I don't feel it's my term to use. My people didn't use it before, it's not mine to take but I respect those who do. I don't think white people should use it ever though but to mention it isn't a problem. Erasing multi-gender and alternative gender labels has been part of colonialism agendas for centuries and that is not a lie.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I've been Justine before and it HURTS to look someone you care about in the face, tell them your identity, and for them to immediately refute your point and attempt to talk you out of your own experience. I had my gender identity dismissed because of my sexuality by a really close friend who essentially went 'You're not nonbinary you're a baby butch' and the casual dismissal of non-standard gender dysphoria and the complete and utter dismissal of the concept of gender euphoria which was something I'd NEVER experienced identifying as a woman. I'm not a woman, I'm not a man, I'm sure as fuck not a baby butch. I'm femme as fuck but that doesn't put mean I have to be forced into a binary where I'll be completely unhappy with myself and how I see my body.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It seems to me that this whole issue of validity has nothing to do with whether or not one can demonstrate their own validity, but is entirely based on the fact that assholes demand proof of validity as a protection against their bigotry and persecution. This, in turn, can become internalized by people who have been victimized but then managed to escape their victimizers by managing to 'validate' their identity, based solely on standards established by the victimizers themselves. Thus reinforcing societal norms, and recruiting former victims as newly converted defenders of the status quo. Talking of the validity of one's identity is the same as asking a rape victim what she was wearing in an attempt to put the blame on the victim. The only cause of rape is rapists; the only cause of validity being an issue at all, is assholes demanding proof of validity. People come in all kinds of weird types and that's all, if you can't handle that, that's YOUR problem, and no one should be under any obligation to validate themselves to bigoted assholes.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"7:15 to put it short, because they don't do that with other mental illnesses.   You know how, let's take another mental illness, depression, for example. Let's say you are feeling depress and you went to a therapist and explain how you felt. They take you're experience and diagnosed you with depression.  They don't look at your brain, even though its well known that a depressed person's brain differ from a normal person's brain. It's already noted that people suffer with depression have a difference in brain structure and all have  common experiences. Mental illness is diagnosed by talking to a therapist about your emotions and experiences. It's not about scanning every person's brain.  And if the person does not have that experience, they have some other mental illness. So far, transgender individuals have been proven to have discomfort. When it is scientifically proven that they difference experiences (gender euphoria without gender dysphoria) then people would be more open.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'Isn't the single most obnoxious thing about men that they think they have to wrap up the entire world in a little rational box?' GIRL, YES. I'm a fellow Marylander, so if we ever meet up, I have a hilariously annoying story to tell you about that.   Also, this video almost made me cry tears of joy at work. (For whatever it's worth, I was about to argue that gender was at least a little psychological, using myself as an example, but I kinda argued myself outta my own point as I was typing it out  and uncovered a little internalized transphobia along the way, so, ew. At least I'm dealing with it, though. It's like an ant infestation--gross, bigger than you can see on the surface, and won't just go away if you ignore it, and in fact it may take over the whole house if you don't exterminate that shit.) My little genderless heart is happy, and also I have far more respect for non-binary people who don't look exactly like me, so thank you for this.

"Ugh. I don't want to write this comment, but I hope you'll listen. I've been a longtime fan, I love the overall argument of this video and I think it's really well done -- but as a queer desi person, ugh... I don't know if this was intentional, but Baltimore Maryland really reminds me of Alok Menon. And it's SO WEIRD to have a white person play a desi person. And it messes up the arguments, too; like when Alok talks about how there have been third-gender communities for ages, that's gender non conforming people of color reclaiming their stories from a history of colonialism, and here it justs feels... ugh. The spirituality reminds me of every white person who's told me they LOVED slumdog millionaire. And the music cues for Baltimore really bother me, too. It almost feels orientalist.  Would you consider having Baltimore played by a person of color? I'm not gonna stop watching or anything. I figure I might get a couple hate comments for this, but I figure you tend to listen when people approach you with criticism, and I might as well say something.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I don't think this does a good job of representing the arguments of 'trans-medicalists' (those who believe you need dysphoria/ need to transition to be trans).  You focus too much on the brain argument, which we don't really use; the feeling of being 'grossed-out', which is not really the case for most of us; and arguments around validity, when we aren't exactly concerned with validity at all.  We aren't concerned about explaining to society why we're real or valid.  We are concerned with two aspects of gender- social relations and the neurological origin. We are concerned mainly with the second-class citizenship of trans women, which is based around the act of social and medical transition.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"*sigh* I'm at 8:27.   I'm some sort of genderqueer that I haven't figured out yet. I suspect genderfluid. Perhaps FtM? Demiboy? I don't know.   I've had several conversations where binary trans folks basically tell me that I'm making a mockery of them. And my existence invalidates them in the eyes of the world. And since I don't have crippling dysphoria that hinders me from my everyday life, I have no claim to trans-ness. I 100% support my binary trans brothers and sisters in their transitions, I'm just a bit tired of the world telling me that I am a special snowflake for trying to live as me, and use words to describe myself.   And I'm a little tired of feeling like a space alien. 'Ooh, look at it! It doesn't conform to gender norms! It thinks it's an attack helicopter.' I don't feel alien. Being genderqueer feels normal to me.  Sorry. The video so far has poked a bit of a sore spot. I'm not a huge fan of my arguments coming out of someone's mouth as something unreasonable, or something meant to invalidate others.   Again, I support my binary trans brothers and sisters. I just want to be viewed as a person. Not a threat, not an alien.  I trust Contrapoints enough to watch till the end of her video. And I trust that she's probably just using it as an exaggeration of how we genderqueers are seen.   It's just a sore spot. It's being poked (perhaps accidentally) by someone I kinda-sorta trust. I don't trust a whole lot of people.   I'll be fine.  Edit: I'm glad I heard her out. She basically said the same thing that I just did. She even thought it through more than I did. Yeah, it's coming from the outside looking in... But most people are on the outside looking in. I'm already sold on the concept that I can be okay with whatever gender and sexual orientation I turn out to be. We just need to get everyone else on board too.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The ten missing arguments (sorry for the long post):   1. Transmedicalism creates the justification for HRT and gender reassignment surgery.   2. Transmedicalism as a mental disorder creates pathways for research funding from large organizations, particularly for treatment.   3. The trans community needs political support to assist with getting rights like protection against workplace discrimination. Scientific explanations create support from political parties that value science and rationalism.   4. If you don't care about surgeries, research funding, or legal protections, then yes, abandoning transmedicalism seems like a completely valid position.   5. Nonbinary people don't have to call themselves trans. To do so seems an explicitly political decision, and thus, should be criticized for its political value.   6. Circus members often were societally mistreated for biological qualities such as unusual hairgrowth, being conjoined twins, albinism, dwarfism, extreme size, age, amputations, mircocephaly, or just being an unusual race or born into a foreign culture. A woman who naturally grows a beard probably shouldn't be placed into the same category as someone who chooses to put on a beard -- although even that statement feels fraught.   7. Baltimore also attempted to self-righteously bully and condescend Tiffany, and also used strong-arm tactics to try to get the moderator on their side. Yet, Baltimore's bullying tactics go unaddressed. Only Tiffany is expected to be accepting and magnanimous.   8. Mental health diagnoses have heavy psychological and performative elements. For example, performatively, major depression requires significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other functioning. Psychologically, suicidal ideation may happen entirely in the mind, but its presence in a patient sets off alarm bells. A brain scan may help scientists understand depression, but it's not required to make a diagnosis -- nor to prescribe very biological medicine to assist. However, this does not make depression unbacked by medical science; current research shows its connections to genetic factors and physical factors such as diet, exercise, and particularly, sunlight. However, Baltimore's criticism of Tiffany not having brain scans for her diagnosis would seem to criticize the reality of all mental disorders, especially ones only recognized in the present day. Justine and Baltimore both rely on appeals to ignorance, and Tiffany is helpless to respond, because she's not an expert on mental health or research into gender dysphoria specifically.   9. On the same issue, people who suffer from depression are often told that it's a choice to be depressed. This is often used in a cruelly dismissive or condescending way that can cause deep emotional anguish. Baltimore uses the same tactic on Tiffany, which seems as outright insulting and cruel as misgendering someone. That doesn't excuse Tiffany's own misgendering and cruelty, but no one addresses Baltimore's viciousness.   10. Yes, it's an artistic video. So maybe some of these absences are purposeful. But the general theme of anti-science, anti-medicine, and anti-political-reality seem very... off-brand. Also, I don't think a lot of the painful aspects of having someone question a mental health diagnosis were intended. The content warnings include transphobia and racism, but not mental illness and ableism, even though the process of talking to therapists and doctors comes up explicitly in the video.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I guess the only definition of a 'transtrender' is someone who starts or stops being 'trans' because they think it's either in or out of fashion or convenient/inconvenient instead of because they've come to the actual conclusion that they are or aren't trans.  The problem with the 'transtrender' situation is that nobody but the suspected 'transtrender' themself can actually say if they were one or not.  If they really believed they were another gender at the time then decided they weren't later, they were never a 'transtrender', they were just figuring things out.  If they reveal that they decided to be another gender based only on 1.) something superficial/surface level such as labels or looks, 2.) a whim, or 3.) not at all about if this is who they really are or if they actually felt like they were that gender, they were probably a 'transtrender' at that time.  However, none of these thoughts or feelings can be confirmed by anyone other than the person who you think might be a 'transtrender'.   Basically, you can only say someone's a 'transtrender' if the actual person reveals it themself later on. If you accuse someone of being one when they haven't openly admitted they were then you're more than likely shitting on someone for just trying to figure themself out over a period of time, which is perfectly normal.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a feminist I'm really allergic to the idea of men and women having different brains. It sounds too much like an argument in favour of the patriarchy. I think that a gendered world will produce the concept of a gendered brain. Science is sadly full of bias. But now I understand why this idea is so reassuring to some. Thanks for that.  It was refreshing to hear Baltimore Maryland. I must admit that I was a bit a upset after your last video. I understand that it is a very personal video but some of your remarks were sexist. I strongly recommend you to read Invisible Women by Caroline Criado-Perez. Bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. For example she explains why women working in academic research tend to presents and acts less in a traditionally feminine manner. By being less feminine, they are perceive more as equal to their male co-workers. I digress.   We should all be more compassionate. I really love this video. It's a fantastic subject. But sadly I only have one friend who is transgender and she is just starting her journey. So I don't want to stir up her emotion by making her justify herself for who she is. Thanks for your video.

"I think there is a valid point to be made that we do not know exactly why being transgender is valid, but that it does not change the fact that it is. The effect of transitioning can be easily measured and isn't explained by any theory that denies this. As recently as that genderdysforia was recognised as thing, this year the world health organisation removed it from the list of mental disorders. I hope this changes the way my country approaches transgender treatment. At the moment there is an 18 month waiting list, before you see a psychiatrist for over a year, where he then decides if you get treatment, through a truly ghoulish protocol.  I think it not being seen as a mental disorder is a good thing, seeing it that way actually invalidates people, like treatment indulges in some kind of delusion.  Interestingly, there are a whole bunch of species of animal that have the physical capacity to change their own gender, chromosomes be damned. As most species have some kind of common ancestry if you look back far enough, I think a case can be made that the desire or need to transition, or not conform, can actually be perfectly natural.  We don't need to prove that we are who we are, that as a fact, can simply be observed.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Yet, I know I am a woman and I haven't questioned it once. Natalie perfectly illustrated that humans are complicated, we have the capability to feel two very different emotions simultaneously. We have a very selfish, hardwired primitive desire to sort everything into categories to determine a threat while at the same time understanding that that is not how the world works and our very smart monkey brains have a HARD time dealing with that.

"As a 'transgender' biologically brained imaginary female so to speak 'for real though i'm a woman, gurl!'... I have to say this really clicked with something i'm researching at the moment on psychological and mental trauma and it's effect upon development of the unconscious self and therefore the way in which we develop our use of language to perform our what we have been told our self should be. I suppose this would be a criticism of gender as performance, but instead saying that gendered body language, spoken language and anything else actually happens as a result of trauma redirecting or reinforcing brain pathways, this eventually leads to any outside show of our selves instead becoming a performance of what we perceive as being acceptable to others. If anything what i'm saying is that women know, men are convinced by their fathers or friends or anyone that they don't know are indoctrinated into thinking 'rationally' or 'logically' when all they're really doing is being conditioned into performing a gender.  But then again entropy does seem to proliferate so what can I do about it... we're fighting against logic becoming more complicated here and it's ridiculous, we don't want to build ourselves another cell philosophically or intellectually yet at the same time we feel the need to prove ourselves.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I get that everyone loves these videos and gets a lot from them. I'm not trying to invalidate that. But I've always found your conversational videos with yourself to be more filled with straw men (straw persons?) and less about exploring different ideas.  I liked this more than other conversational videos by you, but in the end I think you're doing something similar to what one of the characters mentioned near the end; you're externalizing different ways people view gender but this really says more about the way you view gender, the way you view how others view gender, and possibly some inner conflict you have on the issue.  I'm glad these videos are helping people but I worry they have the ability to give people terrible assumptions about what others think and that you need to be more aware of this given the size of your platform.  This has been on my mind a long time but the more you make conversational style videos with yourself, the more I can't in good conscience stay silent.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"why do we waste time stating our locations on the supposed sexual  orientation & gender spectrums when we can just list our physical attraction preferences like we're listing pizza topping preferences, like, 'my only complete turn-offs are facial hair, significant bodyhair above the crotch and a smaller chest than me; otherwise, the more attractive & curvy the better' and it's NOT AT ALL separate from what we'd want our partner to appreciate in music and what we'd want our partner's political awareness to be like and stuff like that  like you can still have MUCH more specific partner body preferences or much LESS restricted ones... and whenever somebody specifically asks you 'what genders are you into' or 'what's your sexual orientation' you can for sure answer those questions however you want but why does the definition of gender and sexuality have to be walled-off from other ideal partner preferences as if there's no connection or overlap whatsoever? 'oh, she likes rick and morty? well i dont think we'd do well together then, cuz i think that shows like the worst...' or 'oh, he likes pickle-flavored potato chips... that's cool that's cool' how is your preferred body type any separate from your preferred butt type or hair type or favourite assistant to doctor who? and getting gender confirmation surgery can of course still confirm your gender; it's not like societal racism and structural misogyny and transman erasure isn't a thing or whatever... Remembering your pronouns isn't as hard as people think... there's like 3 sets most of the time HE SHE THEY barely anyone uses zhe or hir or whatever... but gender confirmation surgery should be otherwise no different than getting a piercing except it MIGHT slightly or vastly change whether someone was sexually attracted to you JUST LIKE GETTING A PIERCING WOULD!!!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Another side note, if people can question their gender and then decide all along they were their biosex, then doesnt that mean some gay guys might actually be straight? Are gay people born gay? Are trans people born trans?

"As someone nonbinary: nice.  I'm going to try to explain my identity before someone asks. I never felt comfortable as a woman. I always wanted to be a man. However, when I started trying to present as male, I felt like I was faking it - like I was playing dress-up. That didn't mean that I was comfortable with womanhood, either, so I was just floating in between, adrift in a sea of horror at my lack of control... and then I realized that this void was where I was okay. I stopped trying to either pass as a man or be comfortable as a woman, and started building my own space with pieces of both. I'm certainly closer to being a guy than a girl, but saying that I'm a trans man is ignoring so many threads of my identity that it's useless as a descriptor.  Baltimore is actually pretty inspiring - they're obviously comfortable with dramatically male and female aspects, and I want to have that much confidence in what I am.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Some of the neurological studies have demonstrated that their transgender subjects had some brain structures that were intermediate between the cisgender male and female subjects. Also, just the fact that intersex people exist counters any argument for binary biological sex, so it only makes sense to extend that concept into the realm of gender identity (not to conflate intersex with being trans; most intersex people are cis). So even aside from the sociocultural and historical reality of nonbinary genders in many different societies there is a basis for nonbinary validity. And yeah, gate-keeping is crappy. For one thing, if you're gender fluid and not constantly dysphoric that can be hard to pin down, but it's very real. And plenty of nonbinary people experience gender dysphoria and want an intermediate physical transition.

"Hmmmm.... Feelings don't quite warrant a diagnosis of other mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. Its about how those feelings cause you to act in wider society. If you feel sad all the time but your actions are more or less societal standard, you wont be diagnosed as depressed. You will be sad. If you feel you are a woman but do nothing about it.... doesn't that mean you are still a man. I wish this was more appealing to me as a consumer viewer, it seems interesting, but just boring tbh.   The age of ideas is essentially meaningless when it comes to anything.... Tumblr is older than gender dysphoria... so confused on some of the points and others, some shit is lacking some serious elaboration in some areas and if anything, I find the video just kind of implies that all trans people despite sides of the debate have no idea. and Cleared nothing up really","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"One issue I see so far though is that the idea of transsexual dysphoria as a severe form of discontent with one's body is not posed.  Dysphoria is presented as a mental disorder when transsexualism is arguably an endocrine condition incited in the womb and played out from puberty till transition.  The body is essentially morphing into another form that the person who possesses it no longer finds familiar.  Children do not display such dimorphic traits as adults do & dysphoria is generally latent as a result during then.  If anything, the over- or underdeveloped genitals become an issue of dysphoria as children, not bodily characteristics.  The 'mental disorder' point seems too stereotypical as a counter to liberal Baltimore as a result; there is a real pain of not feeling bodily integrity that is different from the pain of always being pigeonholed and never seeming simple.  Though yes, society plays a role.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"When it comes to the fact that people with gender dysphoria (generally) don't have brain scans to 'prove' their ttransgenderism, well, why would this matter?

For any other mental illness, a brain scan wouldn't be necessary to show that their mental disorder is legitimate. Natalie pointing out that Tiffany Tumbles doesn't have a brain scan felt like a point well made, but that same view point mapped onto any other mental illness wouldn't make sense. The lack of a brain scan doesn't pull the rug out from under a transmedicalist point of view at all, it is just inconsistent from a scientifically accurate view of mental illness.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Personally, I think that trans people are defined by having gender dysphoria.  Of course, I also support people having a gender-nonconforming presentation, I just don't think it makes sense to call that being transgender.  The beneficial thing about this point of view is that it accurately identifies people with gender dysphoria from a medical stance, and also allows for support of people exploring their gender identity.  Just because gender dysphoria is necessary to be a transgender person in no way prevents a healthy exploration of gender.  It just means that until a person is confirmed to have gender dysphoria, their presentation and such falls only under the category of gender expression. With these distinctions, people who are exploring their identity can do so in a healthy way until they reach a point where they can recognize if they are cis or trans.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"The part of the video that bothered me the most was at 21:52, because Natalie subtly changes how she is defining a transmedicalist view point.  Instead of saying that a person needs gender dysphoria to be transgender, she is saying defines it as a person needing to medically transition.  The distinction between requiring a person to experience gender dysphoria and requiring a person to medically transition will make or break the transmedicalist view point and I think that it is intellectually dishonest for her to disregard this distinction.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"At 23:45 Natalie presents a false dichotomy by saying that, 'gender is either psychological, or biological, or social'.  She presents the cause of gender as being only *one* of these three things, when that's not necessarily true at all.  When she gets to the biological POV, she says it only works if you use a wrong brain in the wrong body argument and state that she doesn't buy that.  I wish Natalie would have been less dismissive of this point of view because I think it has a lot more nuance that she gave it credit for. As we can see through the existence of intersex people, female sex features can naturally occur in men and vise versa.  We have no reason to think that brains should be any different from reproductive organs. The fact is, there are distinct differences in cis male and cis female brains.  Based on the science that is currently available, trans people have significant deviations in their brain structure from what is typical for their biological sex, even before medically transitioning.  Does every sex different feature of the brain show atypical features in trans people? No. But the fact that there are significant differences pretransition indicates that it is scientifically dishonest to write off the brain/body swap theory. There is A LOT of nuance involved in how our brains work and make us do and think what we do. Clearly, there is a lot more that needs to be researched, and there is definitely not enough evidence to justify thinking that this theory has been made up for gate-keeping.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"On non-binary people: A biological explanation of transgenderism doesn't undercut the very real existence of non-binary people. Remember that nuance in our brains I mentioned? Well here is where that becomes even more relevant than before. If every last sex different feature of our brains isn't 'flipped' in trans people, then how much needs to be 'flipped' for a person to turn out to be the gender opposite what their genitals would imply? The gradient between male and female is where non-binary people exist.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The video is fascinating to watch. And as beautiful as ever. Sadly, the majority of the transgender society are not. And this is the fly in the ointment of the acceptance argument. That if you have the resources, dedication and fortune to be able to change your appearance well you will be liked, you will be accepted. If you change your appearance and end up looking (and sounding, and behaving) far more hideous than when you were the gender you were born as then you will be shunned. And if you impose your repulsively uncomfortable presence on people deliberately in order to fight a cause you are going to have a very hard time of it. The principle of tolerance may be sound but it's very hard to accept when what's being constantly fed to you is so hard to be comfortable with. It's just a sad fact and will lead to isolation. But then that's more preferable to those who aren't a part of transgender society. This video is very acceptable to me. But your early ones not so much!

"Phew, trying to collect my thoughts here. First of all, this was a great video. Lots of good points here all around made by all the characters. Now, for what i think.  Well, what is said on the 2nd part of the video is true, you can't exactly prove trans are 'real'. To me, it's because... they're not. Let me clarify. Why do people identify as trans? Because they identify with some of the things that are usually attributed to the other sex in the cliches1. Saying you're trans because you have interests relating to the other sex's cliches seems to imply that sexes are confined to the cliches; which isn't true at all, there's a lot of diversity on both sides! Basically, i am making the argument that genders simply don't exist. Everyone simply has different ways of being, and should do how they please without putting names on it.  Now, i think i know why people do that. They simply are scared to be shamed by other people for not acting like they should. Simple answer? 'I'm not a man/woman'. It's an easy way of getting out of the situation, but it is simply genetically not true. Instead, you should simply own your likes and passions without putting them on a sort of scapegoat. It's the same situation with non-binary really, if you want to act cat-like, well, you can. It doesn't make you a real cat though. Reality... exists. I really can't put this any other way; as much as we sometimes wish we were something else physically, we aren't.  Also, about gender dysphoria: on that point i agree with the 'Baltimore' character (6:23): if you're convinced you're a 'real' trans with real problems, you're eventually going to convince a psychiatrist. Because, it's no rocket science: the psychiatrist subtly asks you what you think is true, until you convince him (and maybe yourself) of it. Then, if other people experience the same phenomenon, a name is put on it as a generalization. I'd say the feelings people are experiencing are due to social pressure explained earlier2.  So, these feelings would be kind of a shield people use to explain to other people their quirky interests, in a time where more and more people are bullied online. See twitter. Sorry to be blunt but twitter is a real cesspool, people are asked to explain themselves all the time, forcing them to adopt a defensive stance. This, and the fact that internet popularized trans-identity, leads to more and more people finding and hiding behind the 'trans shield'; hence why it ended up becoming a recognized condition (dysphoria). So, with that theory in mind, what was diagnosed as problems with gender identity might just be a symptom of the mental protection against bullying.   1(You could make the argument that the cliches are linked to the genders themselves instead of the sex, but that would be dishonest. The origin of the cliches are based on the sex; like how the blue toy isle aimed marketing at the sexually male children, and not male-gendered children.)  2(In reference to paragraph 2)  If you think i have missed something, or disagree, feel free to respond, i'll gladly have a chat with you guys ^^  P.S.: This doesn't mean you can't call yourself a girl if you want to, nothing wrong with that! But please, don't annoy anyone with your interests and/or kinks! Also remember: a 'gender' isn't a personality; i see so many furry friends fall in the trap of limiting their personality to the 'basic furry', it's pretty sad really. Being yourself is the key to stand out, don't become conformist to any standard, even a different standard than 'normie' standard!  P.P.S.: Ok i've been writing this for 1h15. Time to resolve myself to let go of this. Oh well. It won't ever be perfect anyways.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"My philosophy of gender is that gender is neither ideological, biological nor social. Gender is associative. One does not necessarily identify as a gender but more accurately identifies WITH a gender. Though a combination of conscious and unconscious, subtle and direct, social, ideological and biological factors, one builds a personal construct of gender. This construct of gender is re-enforced through association. In a very rough example one may go through life seeing long hair, pink, their mother and high heels and associate them with the label female, and by extension each other.  You can break down the layers of association into four groups: Social-Conscious, Social-Unconscious, Individual-Conscious and Individual-Unconscious. Social as in directed outward and individual as in directed inward. When one's Individual-Unconscious association of a particular classification of gender (i.e. maleness, femaleness etc.) matches with their classification of themselves, that is what we call gender identity.  The categories are formed and changed through association. The easiest category of association to influence is the Social-Conscious and the hardest one is the Individual-Unconscious. I do believe that the Individual-Unconscious theoretically can be changed, but to try to do so would be akin to trying to ungrow a tree or unshatter a glass, it is nearly impossible and is more trouble than it's worth.  In this model trans bigotry can be explained by someone's Social-Concious misaligning with a trans person's Individual-Unconscious and Trans disphoria is explained by one's Social-Unconscious misaligning with their Individual-Unconscious.  Feel free to pick apart my theory. Thank you for listening to my Tedtalk. I'll be accepting my Nobel prize in Gender Studies now.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Baltimore, we stan that tumbnail.  I would definitely agree that we shouldn't have to justify ourselves to others, or even feel encouraged to, but I can't help but (someone kill me before I write this) agree with Tiffany a little. This isn't gonna stop assholes from trying to make us and then using that against us.  Pretty much all of our theories are horrible, Madam Poit outlined the issues with all three pretty well in this video, which pretty much comes down to trying to expand cis people's experiences to our own. It's like the unified theory from the people who are least qualified to talk about it.  Essentially, what I'm saying with this far too long comment that no one will read is that an important and often overlooked gender theory emerges when we ask 'why *shouldn't* we have to justify ourselves?'. The answer I come to, with my degenerate post-modern neo-marxist bulchivism, is that there is fundamentally no difference between my claim to womanhood and a cis woman's. I'm just as valid because no one is really valid at all. We're all just thrown into a society with ties to archaic structures designed by dead people (literal zombies) and we just have to deal with the shit it encourages people to throw at us, and for a lot of people, that involves some label of gender. The only really valid people are non-binary people, because only they are capable of inching closer to the truth that gender is only important because of what we say about it, not what it says about us.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I love Justine's breakdown of gender as either biological, psychological, or sociological, but I think that rather than having to pick one of those things to be 'the real thing', ALL THREE OF THEM are real things, and we need language to differentiate between them. We already have the word 'sex' to be clear when we mean 'biological gender', so that's handled. The sociological sense of the word 'gender' is the one with historical priority, so I also agree with Justine that that's the right referent of the word 'gender' simpliciter.  But Justine's account of gender as a psychological property is missing a lot. 'Just identifying' is itself a sociological thing, not a psychological thing, so that's not something we really need to address beyond sociological gender. But 'gender' dysphoria and euphoria are genuine psychological things: they're how you psychologically feel about the biological sex of your body. And I've been saying for a while now that we need a third word to identify that property of a person, separate from sex ('biological gender') and gender ('sociological gender').  I've suggested the word 'bearing' for that property, because the root '-phor' means 'to bear', and 'bearing' makes a nice navigational metaphor together with 'orientation': your orientation is where you're facing (i.e. who you're looking at), while your bearing is where you're heading (i.e. who you aim to become).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'Society demands we justify our own reality'  If you want the rest of society to participate in 'your reality' then yes, YOU MUST JUSTIFY IT, JUSTINE.  You and other transgenders demand that we participate in, acknowledge, and go along with 'your reality'. That is the demand you put on all of us. Fine. I accept that demand as long as you justify it. And not with 'oh I feel saucy today so you will call me soup'. No. That's not enough. Now if you can provide scientific literature that shows during gestation in the womb when we were all physically and phenotypically female (the first 5-6 weeks), that your divergence to developing male traits did not go all the way through. That your brain was left 'wired' in it's initial female state (or close to) and didn't take to being fully male developed. And if you can show me this, that you have been medically diagnosed as such (via MRI or some other brain scan) then FINE. You are a trans-woman. But what you THINK to be true, no, sorry. Just like you couldn't come up to me and be like, 'I have cancer, because my therapist told me so and because I feel like a person who has cancer'. That's not how that works.  This is not hate. This is not bigotry. This is responding to your demand of society to accept 'your reality' by society demanding that you prove that 'your reality' is real. That is a fair response. It's not exclusionary.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"///////I don't write comments very often, but here it goes.  I've seen quite a few comments here calling you 'philosopher', 'one of the most prominent philosophers of our time', but I always thought that was a stretch. Like when people write 'this is the best acting of all time' under a movie clip - just a way to show appreciation. But this video made me think otherwise.  Post-Modernism, due to its nature seems like a permamnent dead end. The entire foundations of social constructions are being undermined: scientific truth, gender, sexuality, art, etc.; and since the foundation is destroyed, there is nothing to built upon anymore.   You can imagine a leap from modernism to post-modernism for example - there is a clear sense of progression: people quiestioned the order of things, their valididty, hence post-modernism was born. You can imagine a person from the 19th century thinking up what the next step of social evolution would be like. But the situation  with post-modernism is different: nothing can be built when the construction blocks are destroyed.   So, I thought that maybe thats it, the end of history. In 200 years we are still gonna be stuck in post-modernism. The meta-modernism is bullshit. The definition of 'mediations between aspects of both modernism and postmodernism' is vague and inapplicable, its indistinguishable from post-modernism. The New Sincerity is bullshit. It lacks substance to be called an entirely new movement. Its either reactionary, when people really don't like the post-modernism paradigm, so they just return to the modernist ways, or, its, again, post-modern, a way to subvert expectations when they have already been subverted.   But this is different.  You are hinting at an entirely new movement. 'If it feels like it exists, then it exists.' This is not the same as positive realism, where the things exist the way we feel they do. This is 'things exist, and the reason for their existance does not have to be proved by logic. They exist because they do.'  This does sound dellusional, this does sound irrational, anywhere, anytime you would have said this, people would disagree. We always have to prove the theory with rational thinking. It only feels logical:  - So you are saying trans people are not schizophrenic, why? - Well, because of reason number one, reason number two and the causational link between them. - Okay, I agree.  What you are saying is that we don't have to do this, not because we just want this thing to be true really badly, but because this thing really does exist, and the proof is our feelings.   You are spearheading an onslaught onto the entire method of rational thinking, not in the post-modern, 'dismantle everything way', but in a constructive way. You are replacing rationality with something that has yet to be given name to. And if this is true, then you are in fact, one of the prominent philosophers of our time.  Must feel quite annoyed that that philosophy degree turned out to be the thing you will ultimately be categorized by.\\\\\\ ","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

They talk about our other friend who is a trans man who sometimes wears a dress and call him a trender. they called him a trender until he passed as male. they did this with another friend going through her transition in high school. I feel like they talk about me when I'm not there too. Once I said I wanted to go on T and one said 'But it'll just be you as a boy, what's the point of identifying as both??' They don't even conform, they never do anything to attempt to pass, but they call others in the middle of their transition trenders for not passing..

"I feel like this video misrepresents non-binary people to some extent. Not all non-binary people are androgynous. Many are. Just as many women are feminine and many men are masculine. But very feminine afab nonbinary people exist and very masculine amab nonbinary people exist. They still know their gender identity.  Connections to neurological development exist if you need that connection; eg, people with conditions relating to androgynous neurological development, such as autistic people and people with hormone conditions that have impacted them since they were in the womb or during early childhood, are statistically more likely to experience queer identities (though these experiences obviously don't always overlap). The connection to neurological development just isn't always clear. We wouldn't even know where to look to find it on a brain scan. Why do we need to see it on a brain scan for something to be there in the brain? They can't spot sexuality on brain scans but I think it's still reflected in our brains somewhere. In my opinion, gender is biological, psychological, and social. Gender identity is the result of multiple complex and intertwined factors.   At the end of the day, it does all come down to how a person feels and identifies. Facts don't care about your feelings unless the facts being discussed are your feelings. If I say 'I feel sad' people can turn around and tell me 'you're faking it. You seem pretty happy to me. Things are going well for you and you're so privileged in so many ways that of course you're happy. You're just lying about being sad for attention.' That would be a strange reaction and wouldn't actually mean I'm not sad. Maybe I'm not and am lying for attention, I suppose, but at the end of the day I'm the only one with access to my mind and the ability to know what I'm feeling. No amount of brain scans will inform anyone else better than I on what I feel. Whether it be emotions or gender identity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This video resonated so hard with me as a nonbinary person, especially when Justine was talking about how neither binary gender seemed right. I can't figure out my own feelings by my own damn self, and then we have transmedicalists insisting transition is the only valid way to be a real trans person... but I can't even transition because there is no nonbinary biological body. There's presenting androgynously, but what's the difference between that and a 'trender'? There's taking hormones, but that's still a medical transition. There isn't anything I can do about the biological side, the social side is performative, and in the end all I have is the knowledge in my mind that I'm not a binary gender. Is that a psychiatric disorder? Does that make non-dysphoric trans people less mentally ill? In the end, gender is a mix of a bunch of different elements and constructs and genes and brainfeelings, and trying to label it one way or other is... stuffing it into a box that it doesn't belong in. Which is what trans people should know is a terrible idea.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

You see I'm a cisman, questioning sexuality though I don't think it matters much in this question, who likes to on occasions crossdress. I don't think I'm making a statement about it, in fact I've never done it publicly and the idea is straight up terrifying,  and I'd most likely be disowned and I know for a fact that all but one of my friends would cease contact with me, because like in your video a man with a beard who dresses as a woman is neither man nor woman in their eyes yet makes a mockery of both. I don't have a beard but I feel like the sentiment would still carry over to me. As I said I don't think I'm making a statement (except now technically I guess) and I don't really do it for any reason but the fact that it makes me feel cute, I find womens clothing comfortable, and it just makes me happy.

"I'm not really happy with this video, because for all the good content that is coming, you and almost all of your characters are still binary trans* people discussing the validity of a group of people that actually don't get a lot of explanation in. I'm also not happy with the part where Justine states to be non-binary, which could have been a great and powerful message, that being non-binary can be not obvious, and converted into 'eh, well, you are just gay'. And I'm still not a freak - I'm non-binary, and I feel very normal. I don't present very non-binary, and a lot of non-binary people don't. It wouldn't have been a problem that Baltimore is a representation of non-binary people if they wouldn't have been the only one (see: why I don't feel Justine confessing to feel non-binary should have been hand-waved away?)

"Thank You for this, really Thank You.  The one thing that was hinted at but not quite touched are trans people who go far enough to get their dysphoria in check; yet, don't pass or even overcome the desire to do so.  I label as Non-Binary because my dysphoria has been pretty stable and minor since a hysterectomy that was coincidental because of an unrelated condition. At the time I didn't realize I have many of the feelings and experiences of those whom often chose to fully transition, and if that concept had been with me at the time I very well may have gone that route. I'm still considering breast reduction if not full removal, and arguing with myself if my health is even stable enough to consider hrt...  But, right now the most painful things about being born physically female are already gone, or don't bother me deeply enough to feel the constant press of self loathing that used to induce self harm and the screaming thought of 'why couldn't I have been a boy?'  So, I'm neither. I'm NB, and likely I'll still label NB even if I go farther someday because more fem cloths are comfortable and I prefer long hair and nails. Outwardly I pass as gnc fem still, but I don't care about that. Inwardly I still have a twitch at being compared to women socially, get a dysphoric spike from shaving/make-up, and feel actively bothered/out of place in fem spaces 9 times out of 10.  Everything inside my head is masc, the body's not driving me mad anymore, and honestly the rest is some twisted combination of being used to it or it having been safer to 'over conform' when I was in an abusive household. If I could snap my fingers and be male fuck yes I would, but the hair stays period and the nails we'd all have to see what happens over time.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I feel like the argument against butler, that an actor on a stage must, therefore be just as much a man/woman as any other trans person, is a bit reductive. An actor on a stage is putting on a temporary facade. While a trans person doesn't just 'take off' their gender and hang it in the closet when they get home every night. The difference between actor and identity is that between performing a role and forming ones self identity around that role. A trans woman doesnt just act like a woman. She desperately wants to see herself AS a woman. A man playing a woman on a stage never needs to think that they actually are a woman. Trans people do need that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The 'otherwise bad things' line is interesting to interpret. I'm not sure where you meant to go with it. On the one hand: person who desperately needs to be accepted by society feels like she has to be accepted, even if she can't put words to it. Alternatively, you can read the character as recognizing that being trans still isn't a safe thing. Sure, there are some growing bubbles that contain the privilege of safety of expression, but it's not necessarily safe to be trans yet. In fact, it's very far from that, even in places that can be accepting. Needless to say, there's a whole legacy to the term trap buried in there. So maybe that's what Tumbles is referring to, but can't quite put into words.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"this is a complicated subject. i disagree with your contention that 'identity' is something arbitrary, that anyone can choose to be man, woman.. cat, dog, etc. there is a biological basis for identity. it's rooted in the brain, somehow. and perhaps other parts of the body as well. my point is, there is a plausible explanation for why transsexuals exist. perhaps due to some hormonal imbalance in the uterus before the baby is born, as you mentioned in the video. there have also been trans people throughout history, in whatever form.. hijra, two spirit. this biological basis for identity manifests itself in a psychology that sees itself as man or woman, or perhaps non-binary. people used to think (and some still do) that people who think this way are deluded. however we can provide them with a scientific basis for transsexualism, as well as its existence throughout human history and in all cultures, as evidence this is not a delusion. if some people identity themselves as a cat or a dog, there does not seem to be much biological basis for this. other than perhaps the person really is deluded. or it may just be a form of cultural role-playing. i agree what makes someone a man or woman is not the clothes they wear, the roles they occupy in society, their mannerisms, the way they talk. to me, these are superficial things, subject to culture. imo what makes someone a man or woman is self-knowledge. this is an innate sense. it really does not need explanation or justification (partly because i don't think an adequate explanation can be provided). this self-knowledge, in a transsexual, is manifested as a desire to be a man or woman. this is an incredibly strong desire, and one that can never be quenched. this desire may not make one a man or woman. but it surely points out one is a transsexual, or transgender. this desire is as strong (if nor more) than the desire one experiences for sex (for people who are sexual). the question whether a trans woman is a woman, and vice-versa, seems to be a different question. this has more to do with societal acceptance of transsexuals or trans people, and how society wants to integrate us into its social fabric, instead of seeing us as 'freaks' (simply because we cannot be understood, we are so strange to them, abnormal) this secondary question about a trans persons womanhood or manhood does not nullify the existence of trans people, which can be shown to have a biological basis (and therefore valid in a scientific factual sense). i don't know how society will integrate trans people, if it even happens. at the moment, existent categories of man, woman seem to be the only options available in how they can regard us. perhaps new gender categories could be created to accomodate us. anyway, being trans is rooted in biology, even if we don't understand the exact mechanics. this seems to be a more reasonable explanation than saying it's simply something that is arbitrarily chosen, based on cultural preferences. identity as man or woman in a trans person is based on self-knowledge (which does not need explanation) this identity (self-knowledge) is manifested as a strong unquenchable desire to be a man or a woman. imo this is what i see as the fundamental aspect of transsexualism: desire. a trans woman desires to be a woman, and vice-versa.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

One day my best friend who is cis but had a moment where she was like 'hi I'm gender queer and I find it validating to preform in masculine ways'  told me to just stop caring so much and my immediate reaction was to just smile and cry later. I am very fem presenting and lots would describe me as a  femme lesbian and I guess that is fine but I am not always that? I have such a strong disconnect from the label of female or woman and being called that makes my chest hurt but I still wish to be a riot grl and sister some times. In reality I live in society as a women. Socially despite  being very queer I am still constituently viewed and interacted with in a very women way. My friends might have been right to say to just stop thinking about it because I was deSTROyinG my self but I still hate it. I hate that everyone looks at me and sees girl but all I want to do in society is to not be seen as an outcast so I never push the issue.  There is honestly no point in telling people your pronouns in my case because they wont get it right. I am very much fixed as a women in peoples heads and I guess I'll just deal.

"Dammit Natalie, you've done it again. Gone and helped me find some peace of mind.  Until fairly recently I was a lot like Tiffany and her trans-medical essential-ism. Hearing my previously held thoughts and beliefs said out loud helped me realize I've been REALLY projecting my own insecurities on others.  Telling others that 'trenders' are not valid is just me trying to control others, which never works. Instead I should really just be content with self acceptance and treat others with the same dignity, understanding and love I'd gladly give a friend.   I also relate to the character Justeen(sp?) in trying to desperately conform to gendered female stereotypes. With time I found I was really more comfortable without make up and what is often viewed as more tomboy-like clothing. I took up women's power-lifting focusing on strength. There has been something empowering and validating about accepting myself just as I am. I am very fortunate to be able to just by myself and not suffer misgendering. I've actually had activists try to pitch anti-transgender ballet signature initiatives to me. That was hilarious.

"Regrettably, transmedicalism is a complete misreading of psychological science. Psychiatric disorders are identified by their symptoms *and only* by their symptoms. In a very real sense, they are the symptoms. Gender dysphoria cannot prove the existence of an underlying transness because it is only itself. Even if a true biological transness that weren't simply interdefinable with the brain structures responsible for causing dysphoria existed, by virtue of the fact that dysphoria *is not that,* dysphoria cannot prove its presence.  Now, say dysphoria weren't interdefinable with the underlying trans factor (whatever it is); what's that factor? Literally, what is it? What could it possibly be? Why isn't it psychologically diagnosible? Why can't a patient attest to having it in the same way they attest to dysphoria? Why can't it be demonstrated by otherwise examining the patient or their life in the normal way one evaluates psychological disorders?  We've already established asymptomatic psychological disorders aren't things though.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It's not trans people's' fault. But also I really relate to Baltimore because I too am nonbinary- I can be flamboyantly trans but I don't exist to make a statement, and I'm not doing it to send a message. I'm doing it to be comfortable with myself and other just assume that I'm singlehandedly trying to ruin the trans community (according to transmeds) or make every cis person uncomfortable by asserting my pronouns (according to cis people). But I'm honestly just trying to exist in a way that makes me like myself! And I think that's really the goal of trans people in the end! And so if some 15 year old wants to be a cloudgender while on the course to discover themselves I'm not gonna shame them because I refuse to begrudge an innocent person their happiness. And GOD Justine is right about there being a pressure to medically transition in order to be valid- it's such a problem. If we didn't insist is medical transition as a part of being transgender I really don't think this 'detransition phenomena' (which is so rare anyway) would even exist because people would be able to explore their gender without being told that unless they start hormones and have surgery they're lying!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'-Well, do we have a theory about why people are gay? No. They just are. The only reason we even feel like we need a theory about trans people is that society is so unnaccepting of us that it's constantly demanding we justify our own reality.'    THIS.   I've been living in Paris for almost four years now and I went back to Mexico (where I was born) for a couple of months for the first time a few weeks ago. During the trip I saw many old mates and I told one of them that I though I was trans (propably on the non-binary spectrum) and she (not trans) tried to explain me that the only way that I could be trans is by having gender dysphoria and that 'And I don't think you are'. I kinda knew it wasn't an argument because she doesn't really know me anymore (we've been separated for many years now and living completely diferent lives and constructing, apparently, very different points of view about life) and because I already have talked to another friend of my actual school (trans) and he told me that there is a  whole spectrum for non-binary people.    However, even with this I stopped asking myself the question but the truth is that I'm still feeling unconfortable with my own body and with being called a 'man' (but being called 'gay' is ok for me?). When I was talking with her I didn't even try to have an argument because I simply felt... ashamed? I didn't realised that I couldn't say anything because it was a way I feel (and how do we even prove something like that?).    At the end of the day I'm still just confused but knowing that at least there is people that believe that we don't have to justify everything to be who we want to be just makes me feel a little bit better.

Enough that for a long time I thought because I didn't have /this/ particular brand of dysphoria, I must not have it at all. NVM bottom dysphoria is just one part of the total experience for trans folks, one that's exceptionally complex when you live somewhere between the normative ends of the gender spectrum.

"This was both really satisfying to see and also really exhausting. I used to BE that person, who said you could only be trans if you had dysphoria. I used to identify as a cis girl for it, because I thought 'yeah I don't really CARE about pronouns, I dont see why I have to feeeeel like a girl, dunno what that means, but I dont have dysphoria!'   It took a long, long time to feel okay with using the word trans on myself, despite finally admitting I was nonbinary a couple years ago, mostly because I felt like people would be angry if I called myself trans. I felt like I basically didn't exist by any of society's standards or the queer community's standards--I'm an aroace nobinary, who also happens to be Middle Eastern so is forced to identify as white. How exhausting is that? To feel wrong on every level because nobody will be cool with what you are?  But yeah, it's nothing wrong with me. It's what's wrong with a system desperate to box people in for profit and prejudice. Gender is this mix of societal and personal, simply because society is so broken that people who are binary trans feel that if they slack for even a SECOND, they will be invalidated. And most trans people in general have depression! They can't be expected to give it their all every second of every day! That's really not fair to them, to say that because they aren't conforming to society's concept of their gender, it can be called into question.   Hell, some days they might actually like the way they are presenting for a whole minute. It's like the dysphoria isn't even that big a deal. Do they stop being trans? No? What? Listen, all dysphoria is, is having a mental map of your body that the physical form doesn't match, and feeling pretty understandably upset at that disconnect. Who is expected to map out their mental image of themself for the sake of science? Nobody! In the same way depression is based off symptoms and not brain scans, and medication becomes a guessing game as they try to narrow down what is causing the feeling (seratonin not being produced? not being absorbed? being absorbed too fast? all different! all depression.)   It took so long for me to recognize that, yeah, I don't like being called a girl. I don't like having breasts, and I want to be this weird middle ground that people can't tell at a glance. I did not feel comfortable experimenting with gender because I thought other people experimenting (in extreme ways) were weird.   What is wrong with testing extremes so we can find a middle ground, anyway? If it's a 'trend', it's a trend only in the sense that, for a little while, someone identifies as some wild random thing just out of desperation to not be 'boy' or 'girl'. Oh no! A lot of people testing nonbinary waters in crazy ways! Whatever shall we do!! I know! Let's call them crazy for considering any sense of nonbinary-ness to begin with! And at the end of the day, all I hear is 'nonbinary isn't a thing.'   Listen, gender is a gradient of a spectrum. People are constantly in flux every day on other scales, and it's okay for them to be flux in terms of how they view and present themselves as well.    God, I'm sorry. This got long, and will probably disappear into the mass of comments on this video. It just hit hard for me, and I got kind of scared to watch your videos when YT first started recommending me, because I expected belittlement. I'm so used to not being taken seriously in terms of gender and sexuality, this year's pride month was the first time I didn't feel like an outlier. It feels really, really nice, in a sort of bittersweet way, to have someone take this thing so seriously, from all sides, desperately trying to show that yes, this is a complex topic, but empathy and understanding is so important, and gatekeeping hurts people instead of helping.   So. Thanks.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It seems rather apparent to me that gender isn't exclusively sociological, psychological or biological. Any conceptualization of gender is necessarily socially constructed in the context of the society we live in, hence an essential biological 'maleness' or 'femaleness' is impossible. However there undeniably are underlying biological factors that drive extremely strong feelings that coincide with the social construct of gender, only it does not map perfectly and so we make adjustments to the concepts we think in for the sake of our own sanity and ask society to humor us, so that we may not feel like absolute shit all the time. I think that's basically all there is to it and with that understanding in mind it should be obvious that you shouldn't bother transitioning to some social ideal, but to whatever makes you feel happy and comfortable.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I don't think the greater society at large want to regiment trans people and put them into neat little boxes or have them defend their rationale for existing but, at least for me, I want trans people to understand what they 'ff-f-fff-f-ffeeel' and two why they feel it and what the boundaries are. If you just want us to accept it without voicing any real criticisms then Zaddy jordan Peterson was right and this is a form of radical leftist gay anti christ totalitarianism lmao. For example I hear of then people say that gender is a 'Social Construct' (when they say this i believe they mean that it's sort of made up by humans and theres no real reason why we should act in the ways that we do). And to that I sayd, if its a social construct why is it so important that you identitfy with the opposite gender?  I should say that i actully don't mind trans poelpe and have trans friends myself. Its just that when you only make arguments on feelings and don't have clear definitions you omit serious flaws in arguments around legislating equality. For example should we let children make serious early life decisions on their gender identity, even involving medical intervention. If you seriously need to transition to live, as I've heard many trans peolpe say, should the government subsidize hormonal therapy like it does with Dialysis?

"One thing I do notice about what some people label 'trans-trenders' is that most of them seemed to have transitioned from being biologically female. I think that the reason this might be could be a lot of different factors. However, factor could be (and bare with me on this) the prevalence of yaoi (Japanese boyxboy comics) on the internet. I knew a lot of girls in high school that fetishized gay relationships because of what they read in these comics, and I've seen quite a few 'trenders' post a lot about yaoi on social media. They seem to want to become like the characters in the comics, and a lot of them are portrayed very androgynously. Obviously this does not describe all or even most 'trenders' but it is definitely something I have observed and found interesting.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There's a whole categorization problem at the center of this. People have to put something down in which to define a category. If you make the category too vague, fewer people will accept it.  We are all lost puppies in some respect.  This is broader than gender categories.   I still think perforative best fits how to categorize gender. If a man plays a woman on stage well enough to convince others he is a woman than who's to say he isn't in that act? The problem is that the category can change with time in such a scenario and it's not even a universal categorization as some remain unconvinced.  But the conflict then happens at the communication level when others state things that seem patently untrue. A pervasive certainty of others grabs our attention, and we can't ignore those that disagree completely.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

So the question I have is if a trans man (for example) was assigned as a girl at birth and raised as a girl throughout his life, how is gender socially constructed when he is socially conditioned to believe that he is girl and still grow up to identify as a man or non binary? If gender is socially construct, then wouldn't those who are raised as one gender identify that way for the rest of their life?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I'm not sure what I am at this point, but I definitely do not perform as other cis women and never have, and the whole portion of this video dealing with performance and presentation really struck something in me.  I'm not going to be claiming I'm anything other than cis because really it would feel like appropriation, but as a gnc person it's so inherently interesting to hear and talk about society, how we interface with it and what that means for us, how it shapes our own perception of ourselves.

"Look, I know very well you'd hate me IRL Natelie, because because I'm almost entirely like Tiffany but...  I wish you'd put Tiffany in a slightly better light. I have such problems with the trans community and SJW hatred that I'd treasure a friend like Justine, whom I could actually talk with trans issues about respectfully. I'm a conservative trans person who is accepting of homosexuality though less enthused about it than Tiffany, is be flattered by Justine, although weirded out. I certainly would do everything in my power to retain a legitimate friendship and not slide into frenemy territory.   I want that normal too. But not enough to be nasty to everyone who slightly disagrees.   Someone like me sees it this way: third gender was a transitory step, the most transition could go. The problem someone like me has with 'trenders' (although I personally understand it was a legitimate wiring problem) is the lack of wanting to assimilate into heteronormative society.   Human beings are not creatures of self definition. We are here to,reproduce and increase the reproductive fitness of our kin through social duty. In principle everyone is required to work, to fight, and to breed as their society requires, and as others doing their part is the only reason we didn't starve as children or die of communicable diseases as infants, we do not get an opt out of any of this.   Tiffany would be cis if she could. If the technology was there she would probably get everything in order, assimilate into regular society, marry heterosexually, and then birth children.

"I've been a prime target for harassment from transmeds for a while; I'm an afab non binary teenager who dyes their undercut wacky colours and dresses androgynously. The fact that I can't bind very often due to my disability doesn't help either. But I know that I am definitely trans. I am definitely not a girl, though it's difficult to explain why. I'm just not. But for many transmeds this isn't enough. Because I don't conform to their ideas of what a trans person should be, I obviously must be faking it, despite the fact that I've known I was non binary for about 5 years now, which is probably a long time for me to be faking it.  Even though I didn't have much of a social media presence when I was first figuring out my gender, I still copped a lot of harassment from transmeds, and saw it being thrown at all other people who looked and identified similar to me. It's definitely had a lasting impact on my mental health and I have mountains of internalised transphobia to unpack. I hate my gender. I feel embarrassed by my own non-binary-ness all the time because of how often transmeds told me I should.  Thankfully I've made some really great IRL trans friends who are all very accepting and make me hate my gender a little less. So thank you for this video Natalie, It makes me feel a bit more affirmed. You are doing great work that will help lots of people.  -Cal","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

All my life, however, I've felt non binary without knowing how to put it into words. All my life people have been confused by my gender and, without even realising, I have always been living in a non binary gender roll that I have carved out, and will probably always have to continue carving out, for myself.

"It seems to me that there's something fundamentally wrong about Tiffany's enterprise. No one should have to justify their inner truth or their right to exist as they truly are. To even try to argue for such a thing seems like capitulation. I hesitate to say this though. Other commenters would be right to say it smacks of policing a marginalized group I'm not a part of. But I'm compelled to say Tabby is right. What matters is what's inside. That's really not the sort of thing someone-who-isn't-you should be able dismiss, no matter how wild that truth seems to be. We should make this socially unacceptable whenever dismissal happens. Are you a wolfkin? Cool. Do you sincerely identify as an attack helicopter (e.g. are you working for the day when you can upload your consciousness into a machine mind who's body is an attack helicopter)? You're fuckin' valid. 100% valid, full stop. So what about people like rachel dolezal? There may not be a single answer, but I have to think that we should lean towards acceptance unless there are seriously bad consequences to such acceptance. Even then there may be ways of mitigating those consequences while still accepting the deviant. Accepting the deviant should be the default. It should feel extremely wrong to not accept the deviant, no matter how much they deviate. What about people who are lying or taking the piss? Fuck 'em. Unless/until they reveal themselves, life's too short to worry about those assholes. This is definitely a strong opinion loosely held, I still need to think more about this, but my gut tells me that policing who is and isn't valid for the sake of placating elements of society that are hostile to your existence is a really really bad idea that ultimately will do much more harm than good.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Even though I still think a person needs dysphoria to be trans, I agree that some truscums and transmeds are becoming toxic. I literally don't know how to feel about Kalvin Garrah anymore. I may agree with him in alot of things, bute he's too quick to judge other trans people. The moment he sees a trans guy being feminine in the slightest, he jumps to conclusions and assumes that the person is a trender when they're probably not. The main problem is gender roles, the idea encompassing a range of behaviors and attitudes that are generally considered acceptable, appropriate, or desirable for people based on their gender. I realized that there are transmeds who are hypocritical. Because they don't say anything when a cis guy is feminine, but then lose their shit when a trans guy is feminine. Being feminine, masculine, or androgynous does NOT define gender. They don't even define how dysphoric a person is. Those are just personalities.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

My reflection never disgusted me, but I believe acceptance for who you are is one of the steps people need to understand and transition through on their own terms instead of the noise around them. I am happy and full acceptance of my female body and have come to realize that even though people need labels to make themselves feel comfortable, I don't.

"There are differences between male and female brains, if they wanted to be technically anal about it, there are differences between every brain. From a systemic view, you would notice that several things can affect brain development over the period of a person's life. That's biological hormonal differences that arise because of hard differences between the sexes (gonads) and the societal influences which arise from both biology and from sociology.  These all interact with each other to shape brains, bone, appearances, everything. But that the human body is so malleable gives hope to change.  I don't like that there is some worry that innateness will be an excuse or is used as a reasoning to 'not do something'. That seems more of a problem with the person who uses the innateness of their biology or blames things as being unchangeable than it has to do with the underlying facts of biology. The more we learn of the human body, the more we learn just how much it can be changed and how little even bones are set.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There is a 'why is' theory on sexuality a la the 'choice vs. innate' argument (i.e. 'born this way'). I pose the counterpoint that having a definitive answer would be a bad thing regardless, because having a biological manual to sexuality or gender gives malicious parties an opening to try and manipulate them. The point should never be about whether or not sexuality or gender are innate, it should be that it doesn't matter either way. Experiment as you please, it hurts no one, and hope like hell no one ever figures out the 'why' of it. These things don't warrant justification just for existing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Have you considered the argument from Evolutionary Psychology?  (Let's see what I can do in a YouTube comment to describe it)  First, evolutionary psych is the theory that some of our psychological traits were naturally selected for their fitness. Like physical traits, you wouldn't expect every fit trait to show up in every individual, but fit traits would show up in most individuals. Rough (real rough) example: the ability for parents (and especially mothers) to bond strongly w/their offspring is a fit trait that is commonly found in the population.  The goal of evolutionary psych is to explain how and why many human behaviors seem to be so widespread regardless of cultural context.  Ok, w/that brief explanation that doesn't do it justice, let's jump over to personality trait theory: the theory that there are (at minimum) 5 fundamental traits that, when mixed and matched, make up personalities. Ex: openess to expierence. A person who has this trait will seek out new experiences and a person who doesn't, won't. Except it's not actually a binary but a spectrum, so someone would be placed somewhere between completely open and completely closed.  There are 5 traits that have a buttload of proof, and the research psych community is testing 2 others, so the end result might be 7. The point is though, that each person's personality can be desrcibed using these traits. Imagine you had a panel with 5 sliders in front of you. Everyone has the same 5 sliders, but each of us has a slightly different configuration. The important piece to take away from this theory is that the sliders are set. We are born with our personalities, and once we reach adulthood, they remain stable throughout the rest of our lives. Finally, we inherit these traits (our personality sliders will be some combination of our parents), thereby showinng that psychological traits can be passed down and can be inherit, though our actual behaviors will be a product of our personality reacting to our context.  So, what does any of that have to do with trans people and gender? Well, when combined, I think they provide the most compelling/explanatory theory of gender.  Gender is not a social construct (a pox on performative theory!), it's a bundle of psychological traits similar to personality. Who knows how many traits make up a gender (4, 5, 6? Let's do research to find out!) but combined, you get a person's gender, a stable psychological identity that influences a person's behavior.  But why did we evolve genders, and why do they seem so intertwined with sex? Well, b/c they're useful. It is useful for ppl with penises/uteruses to have some preloaded behaviors that help them make the best use of that equipement. And because genders are an evolved feature, you would expect most people to have the most fit (for producing children) combination of gender and sex, which is what we see. Most people are straight and cis (oh yeah, sexuality got thrown in under this theory as a trait making up the gender profile). But also because it's an evolved trait, you would not expect every individual to have the most fit (for producing children, not at life in general, do not use this to bash queer ppl!) combination because shit happens and the real world is messy like that, cue the entire lgbtq spectrum.  'But gender presentation is so culturally bound!' I can hear the performative theorists screaming.  Well, that's why I make a distinction between gender and gender roles. Gender is inherit to an individual, gender roles are constructions of society. Here's how they interact using an anolgy between a sex characteristic and a gender role:  As a transman, I noticed a legit lessening of my tendency to express strong emotions (sadness, anger, pride) via tears when I had high testosterone levels. I didn't stop feeling those emotions, but I experienced them differently. That's a real physiological aspect of the male sex: all the 'boys don't cry' bullshit piled on top of it is a gender role.  Gender roles are like astrology: yes the stars exist, but all the meaning you're reading into thdem is questionable. >>  So gender roles are performative, but gender isn't.  More importantly, gender varients (transpeople) DO NOT HAVE A DISORDER! (burn in hell, transmedicalism). We're relatively rarer than the cis varient, but not unexpected.  'But why should we spend societal resources helping those who want to transition, transition. If trans peoole have always existed, can't they just deal with their body/gender mismatch like they always have?'  Yes, yes we could. We could also perform surgeries without anesthesia and burn oil to light our houses. But we don't because we don't have to, and trans people who want to transition don't have to make do with less either.  'Ok, fine, some people can switch if they want, but why do we have to create an entirely new gender and use 'they'?'  Uh, because we're not idiots who waste time reinventing the wheel when we have spaceships to build. Human societies have continually and routinely created a variety of gender roles (complete with their own linguistic terms): i.e. two spirit, hijra, etc. Our society is just doing what we've always done. Medical transitions are new, third and fourth gender linguistic terms are actaully way less radical. This century it's nonbinary, next century it may be something else.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Do we really need that much more. And yeah maybe even I doubt the second part, because we don't really know, but the thing here is.. We don't really have to. We don't really have to, because it tends to be harmless. Or at least that's what I think. Because the backlash against differences tends to be what actually hurts, at least in my opinion Anyway, tangent aside, even if we go by dysphoria as a signifier, I definitely think we should include euphoria as well, and in general I think that we can't really separate the biological psychological and sociological aspects of gender as a definition, because even if the gender binary is based on some biological foundation it also has many useless from that point of view mannerisms stereotypes colour preferences appropriate toys and clothes.....and yet all of that has to factor in account how we personally perceive those traits stereotypes and wherever or not we fit with them and/or want to fit within","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I definately feel as though it is necessary for there to be a space for nonbinary people in the trans community. The 'trans enough' debate reminds me a lot of the 'lesbian enough' debate, where there are 'gold star' lesbians and spaces exist where lesbians refuse to date women who have dated men. Strait people often invalidated the experiences of wlw by asserting that it is 'just a phase' or that it stems from trauma, and no doubt this was damaging. So people clung to sexual orientation being solely genetic and set in stone in order to defend themselves, such that it invalidated the experiences for women of whom those things were true. Maybe some woman legitamently did have trauma that made it impossible for her to feel comfortble in a relationship with a man, but if she were honest about it, she would likely be rejected by the lesbian community for not being lesbian enough. But the way I see it, this woman only dates women now, and so she's lesbian enough, no matter how she may have identified in the past or what the 'cause' is.  I think everyone in the queer community has at some point been guilty of looking at someone and thinking 'they aren't queer enough,' because we are afraid of how strait or cis people might use these people as evidence to invalidate our own experiences. And so we fall back on imposing the same limitations that are set on us. We give rules so only those who are 'queer enough' are let in, and more and more we impose strait/cis ideas of normalcy. 'I'm trans enough because I have dysphoria and can pass.' 'I'm gay enough because I have never questioned my orientation.' 'I'm bi enough because I like all genders exactly equally.' In an attempt to make LGBTQ lives 'normal,' we've set standards of normalcy to meet and turned the lives of queer people into chess pieces to move our agenda of 'Look! Queer people are normal just like strait and cis people!' when what we should be doing is dismantaling our dependance on normalcy and let people take ownership of their own lives, the same way we want to take ownership of our own.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The idea of trying to rationalize transgenderism into something cis people can understand in order to gain acceptance is stupid. Transphobia is not a position born out of pure logic it comes out of a primitive part of the brain that thinks 'men dressing as women' is gross. The reason gay people are as accepted as they are right now isn't because a lesbian pulled out a PowerPoint presentation and was able to logically explains homosexual attraction to straights. People just got used to the idea... or rather ARE getting used to the idea. Normalization is the best way to fully integrate lgbt to society and that's gonna take a while, it sucks but meanwhile sucking up to ignorants is not the way to go because all you will ever accomplish is being thought of as 'one of the good ones' and that's not a label anyone should carry with pride.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i get the intended and fruitful takeaway is: there's no sense policing or critiquing other queer folk for the 'betterment' of LGBTQIA+ people as that's energy not battling the oppressive systems that are the real danger to tiffany-esque characters - but i think backing away from using a theory to feel valid was a misstep as none of the 3 (biological, psychological, or social) are all encompassing or perfect, but combining them and using them to frame queer experiences definitely helps.  I get joy from being called ma'am and feel safe in passing? Social.  I get upset at my own facial hair? Psychological.  My body is producing less testosterone and/or has less energy when off E? Biological. I allow myself these feelings of validity even though they are sometimes conflicting (i.e if it's all social then why do i feel compelled to take HRT and present femme in privacy?) as holistic human experiences could never be encompassed in any one frame, but they help explain and bring comfort. tl;dr: be nice to yourself - use the theories to feel better not worse","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I'm cis, but damn, I've felt that 'am I just a trender because I haven't felt X' as an ace person. When I started questioning and researching asexuality, a lot of ace people said that they had felt broken, or that something was wrong with them. I had never felt that. At most I thought 'oh maybe I'm just late or something' as a 17-year old who had never masturbated, let alone kissed someone.   I mean, I'm so grateful that I didn't have to struggle with feeling broken on top of my general lack of selfconfidence, but it also led to doubts of 'am I really ace? Do I really belong in the LGBTQ+ community? Am I a fraud for walking in the pride parade?' until I had my first (and thus far only) sexual experience. If that night was a test, I totally aced it (badum tss).   I might edit or add to this section after a rewatch, but the part of 'performing gender' and if a man playing a woman for 2 hours /makes/ him a woman for those hours immediately got me thinking of Takarazuka.   Short intro: Takarazuka is a Japanese theatre company that only employs women in all roles. It was founded in 1914 and is actually a school with two years of classes. The first year all girls train together but in the second year they choose/gets chosen whether they want to specialise in female roles (musumeyaku) or male roles (otokoyaku). If a student becomes a otokoyaku she cuts her hair short, starts using masculine pronouns, is taught how to behave more 'manly' and is only allowed to wear traditionally masculine clothes aka RIP all skirts.   Okay intro over, the thing I got thinking about is that the otokoyaku ladies are low-key performing a masculine gender always, as long as they're with the company. I guess you could call their stage time as high-key performing, because then they're seen not as women-playing-men, but as 'actual' men. Mostly because the company is big on the 'no homo' thing after two big scandals of fans sending real love letters to the performers and a lesbian couple was found out within the company. I think both scandals was around the 30's but I'm tangeting.   The thing I meant to get to was a quote from the wikipedia page about Zuka. It's from two former otokoyaku actresses and (to me at least) shows two different spectres of performing gender.   'Tsurugi Miyuki, top otokoyaku star [top star = leader, gets all main roles] of the Moon troupe, said that she conceived male impersonation as just a 'role' that she wore like the makeup and costume that helped create her otokoyaku image. She said that she reverts to her nonperforming 'feminine' self after performance. Other otokoyaku feel uncomfortable switching to female roles. Otokoyaku Matsu Akira, who retired in 1982, stated: 'Even though I am a female, the thing called 'female' just won't emerge at all.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Isn't Baltimore just a drag queen though? Having beards isn't uncommon for that kind of performance, as far as I know most of the so-called 'transtrenders' aren't dressing in drag.  Also you're doing the thing of conflating gender identity (ie. your feelings dictated by brain structure and chemistry, which is bimodal) with gender expression (ie. how you choose to act, dress, and portray yourself socially). That's quite common, but it's an important distinction to make. A lot of people are 'non-binary': that is they want to express themselves in a way different from the historic gender roles. But they aren't necessarily trans, anyone can express themselves however they like. Transpeople on the other hand have a specific medical situation that may or may not cause a degree of dysphoria.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I identify as a compassionate, understanding and open minded loving human being.  I don't need to understand something fully to accept it or know the theory.

"This video is really important, when I first started questioning my gender I tentatively identified as nonbinary (only privately) but the backlash and aggressive comments from people online sent me right back into 'ok nvm just forget about all this you're a cis female' four years later I decided 'fuck it I'm going to tell people to use he/him for me' and my inner reaction was so strong that a month later I was already scrambling to secure it forever, finally fully accepting myself as a transguy without tiptoeing around it. I still identify as nb to some degree, but if I was allowed to be nb from the start without all the disapproval I would have realized I was trans way before I did.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"If there is no biological basis for trans people as this video states, and that gender is a social construct, then you'd be validating the conservative viewpoint that trans people are by nature, caused by societal pressures (aka 'liberal brainwashing') and thus, can have their condition reversed by simply convincing them they are not trans and reversing the 'brainwashing'.   This seems very counterproductive.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You are not representing both sides fairly. It's obvious where you have your bias. You had to make the conservative with blonde hair blue eyes and have them talk out of place and seem childish while the trender was calm and collected. Those roles are usually 100% reversed. Im not conservative what so ever but it pisses me off seeing my left not actually saying anything and just slandering the right with childish rhetoric and no solutions to problems. And there is scientific evidence on male and female brains with testosterone and hormone levels being different. Different hemispheres of the brain are larger or smaller depending on if your male or female. Also your brain is the reason you feel dysphoria, your thoughts and feelings are interpereted by your brain so idk what kind of argument is 'well you cant see your dysphoria physically on your brain you just feel it, so your barin has nothing to do with your dyshoria, its your feelings' wth kind of argument is that?

Don't get me wrong, you should talk about what you want, and enlightening the public about trans people is great, but at a certain point I feel like I'm not getting any value from these repetitious videos. As someone who who supports the community but doesn't identify as trans myself, I am losing interest in watching video after video on the same topic with little variation.

"I think I disagree with trans trenders  because there's not a good separation between gender expression and gender identity. This confuses younger children because just because they nobody perfectly expresses themselves in a certain way that makes them fit the gender roles.   This confused and made me feel awkward and confused because I express myself as heavily male but I am female with no dysphoria. After leaving tumblr and all the trans pushing groups, I finally felt comfortable in my own skin when the pressure died down.   If someone feels they're trans I will respect them in any way I can. But my issue is a mix between the mixing of expression and identity and the pressures for cis people to find themselves a way to label themselves as something that falls under trans.   I'm all for breaking down gender roles and if you ask me to refer to you as anything I will more than happily do so. I will accept anyone with whatever they identify as, but I think the issue isn't within the people who are misguidedly identifying but instead what is misguiding them.

"I'm genuinely a transmed myself and I disagree with policing presentation and dysphoria. There's no goddamn reason to tell NB or GNC transsexuals they're 'invalid' because their dysphoria isn't ours to dictate. Only their doctor can dispute their dysphoria, and it's not fair to call GNC trans people 'non-dysphoric'. It's pretty straight-forward, and I can't believe how many people still think all dysphoria is body dysphoria. Social dysphoria exists and is acknowledged medically. Wanting to be called different pronouns and a different name to what you're assigned? That's also part of dysphoria! Wanting to transition at all, is part of dysphoria. All forms of transition are valid forms. It doesn't just have to be medical. Transition is just a journey to living in a way that you're more comfortable with. I've been trying to rally transmeds together and spread these ideas. I don't like the misconception that dysphoria is self hate when all it is is the desire to transition to a different gender experience. This includes NB identities too. That's genuinely how most doctors see it, as well.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Huh. Well that's a lot to think about. I don't think everyone's needs can be met at once. I'm a trans med centrist trash trans guy, (I do think Dave Rubin is a hack, lmao) and while I think there are still arguments for favoring transmedicalism that are motivated by reasons more legitimate and not selfish and shitty [see 'self loathing bully'], you offer so much more than anyone else I've ever heard on the 'sjw' side of the argument, and damn it I wish we could talk.  Medical transition is extremely important for some people (it's improved my life dramatically), and I don't think informed consent is gonna cut it, especially if we need to solve the very real problem of figuring out how to respond to dysphoria in kids, and navigating the complicated causes for desire to medically transition, and that mental health professionals may be inadvertently offering people treatments that do more harm than good, if the person's dysphoria is rooted in trauma or sexism or internalized homophobia, etc. - in short, I don't think we can ignore the need to better determine who will and won't be helped by medical transition. Without attempting to develop some kind of theory around how all this shit works, how do we address this? I don't think pure informed consent is good enough, and while preventing needed transition is obviously a real problem, so is poorly addressing what may be other mental health issues. Does that necessarily turn in to scrutinizing peoples' identities? Is that worse? What creates a better outcome? Can we get by with 'no theory'?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

We will be here until the end of time trying to accurately label every possible mode of existence. Everyone is non binary if you really think about it. Just because someone fulfills a stereotype in one way doesn't mean they will in another.

That they are confused, been told over and over that they should be this so the become that-or try to- just to realize that they aren't. Just alittle more masculine or feminine than most. But I also know that some people only say 'I am a woman' while fully knowing they are a man, still acting, dressing, and behaving like a man. Just for the clout. (Cloat? Idk.) I think that (to be fair this is my thoughts.)  Man, woman, trans (both ways? They are what they identify with but the mixes with sexuality thing with the whole pansexual bisexual but just to make it simple. Well separate them for now.) Both, and neither. So that's 6 (4 with two subsections? I feel like an ass putting it that way.) I think people feel the need to fit perfectly into a box. Isn't a tomgirl still a girl? Or a feminine boy still a boy? In my personal opinion, the boxes are huge. Alot of people can fit into a box. Liking to wear a dress doesn't make you any less of a man. More feminine yes.

But now, I feel as tho we only have one life, and precious time, what should it matter if someone without dysphoria identifies as trans. Dysphoria isn't fun, I know this all too well. But if a person is happy with their body, but still feels as tho they are the opposite gender, then good for them! They don't have to deal with all the pain that comes with having dysphoria, they can just live. A trans person without dysphoria doesn't invalidate trans people with dysphoria, and I think that's what a lot of transmed people seem to think. No matter your dysphoria status, you are valid. And now as for what trans people seem like in society, and how they appear to cis people, I personally think, what does it matter? We shouldn't have to constantly worry about whether someone identifies as nonbinary or genderfluid, because at the end of the day, everyone, trans with dysphoria or not, has their own promblems to deal with, and we only have so little time to be alive.

"Presenting as a specific non-binary gender for the sake of making a societal statement is much the same as presenting as a particular orientation to gain favour in specific social circles. But it gets hazy when you try to police the sincerity of the performance. Are they genuinely just experimenting? If they don't know the answer right at that moment, then no one else will. And it's unbecoming for a social group to try and haze another for the reason that the perpetrator is already being victimised by another group. It makes them as bad as their own tormentor.   I felt strongly about Baltimore Maryland at first, but after dissolving the 'trender' outer shell and observing closely, concepts like 'stealth' and the compulsive need to conform in a very specific way feels more like I'm trying to convince myself and not other people (although that does help with the former). Yet I CRAVE that gender conformity because it's not just soothing to distance myself from a presentation that I consistently abhor performing, but humble & relatively safe from the scathing judgement of a captive audience, who may or may not be happy to see me, and will make damn sure that I know what they think of me as a matter of personal duty, whether I asked for it or not.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I feel like there's something that I'm not understanding. Why do we have to view dysphoria through a purely biological understanding of the trans experience? Is dysphoria incompatible with a performative theory of gender? I recognize that it's a cisnormative framing, but there must be some sort of negative emotion associated with embodying the social role of someone's assigned gender that would cause them to choose to identify themselves as nonbinary.* As I said before I may simply be understanding the true definition of dysphoria.   I also can't help but feel the video glosses over the intricacies of childhood transition. From my personal experience with being 'a trender' the issues of transmedicalism and the place of dysphoria in the trans experience weren't really relevant. Adolescence is generally a time of self hatred and dissatisfaction. Therefore the issue is not the question of dysphoria's relevance but its misidentification. It can be very comforting to explain away a complex dissatisfaction with oneself through adopting the trans identity, whether or not it is fitting. Obviously this discussion is tangential to the main topic of the video, but it seems it should have been left out if it weren't going to be discussed in depth.  Finally, I'd just like to have a more nuanced understanding of the non-binary communities relationship with social categorization. Baltimore Maryland says many times that they don't want to be beholden to societal groupings. This, to me, seems to be antithetical to the trend towards increasing specificity in the labeling of gender and sexual identifies. While I understand the stated goal of these labels is to create a sense of acceptance, it's hard to shake the feeling that at a point they shift from fostering community to being banners behind which to rally in the 'oppression olympics'. If the idea of gender noncomformity is based partially on the idea that the distinction of gender is inherently oppressive, then isn't hyper-categorizing of these identities counter-productive. I understand that this argument does fall into the trap the Natalie talked about in her last video (trans people shouldn't exist because abolish gender), but I still feel like it has some place in the conversation about the validity of certain people's identities.   *obviously in a society without preexisting expectations of gender the question of dysphoria wouldn't be an issue, but with the inevitability of some level of oppression in the world today there must be some personal reason for transition   (ie avoidance of dysphoria) that makes enduring that oppression 'worth it'  Thank you to anyone that had the patience to make it through this mess!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thanks for this. I was androgynous in my teens (during the mid-nineties) and early twenties where I didn't fully identify with either gender within the binary. Over time, I have reconciled this and in certain instances I continue to feel 'nongendered' for lack of a better term,but I do not identify as trans. I am a woman both identity and through biology (again, lack of a better explanation). I came to realize that being a woman has a broad range of expression and every experience we have isn't predetermined by our gametes. I continue to have mild dysphoria at times but transitioning to male would have been totally wrong for me as that is not truly who I am. I am very happy being a woman who performs as a king at times. And when I perform as an athlete, and a lot of other times, I am genderless. I respect all the expressions within the trans continuum and because I predominantly cis and don't feel it right to claim a space on the continuum for myself. I believe that it is really weird that there is an accepted fascination and in some cases a mental CSI investigation into the gametes of strangers and whether or not, based on that discovery, the stranger defines themselves by parameters expected from of a specific society. I feel gender expression is so benign and does not rob others of their agency but some people act like non-binary expression or binary trans expression is gonna make us all fall of the earth and become slaves to the mighty Space Beasts.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hey transmed truscum transwoman here, I feel like I'd like to actually rationalize my beliefs because I don't think Tiffany did a good job at it.   First my beliefs, I believe gender dysphoria is a medically diagnosable condition that essentially means the person diagnosed has discomfort with their gender assigned at birth. I don't believe that definition excludes non binary people or identities I also don't believe that someone needs to transition if they have gender dysphoria. I don't believe people need to actually be diagnosed with gender dysphoria in order to consider themselves or be considered trans, just that they could be diagnosed if they saw the appropriate professional. I do think though that there are a number of ways a person could get gender dysphoria, and I think that the only one that leads to actual satisfaction after transitioning and is the most common one is the brain not matching the biological sex. I feel like that's probably the extent of my beliefs on the issue that you need to know so I'll get started.  To start I'll validate non binary people, so first my significant other is non binary, and they experience gender dysphoria. Their dysphoria fits at least 2 of the diagnostic criteria also they experience the general feeling in the same way I do so they're super valid. They don't feel the need to pass in any way either and why should they? If they like the way they look then they should be allowed to look like that. That goes for binary people too trans or not. Now to be a little less validating I do not think non binary can be viewed as a gender because despite there being a number of possible ways to feel it they all boil down to not purely man and not purely woman, so I consider it to be more of a half gender so hilariously the talk show host wasn't actually entirely wrong in saying there are 2 and a half genders. I think that non binary identities that go beyond simply the term non binary are fine to label oneself with and can make people feel better about themselves but aren't common enough to try to construct gender roles around and shape society towards. So neopronouns seem unreasonable because they/them pronouns are perfectly fine and descriptive.  Next what do I believe defines gender? So I think that gender comes from all three of the things mentioned in the video, it comes from biology, identity or your mind, and society or presentation. I think the least important of the three factors is biology and especially anatomy because that usually doesn't come up or apply in every day life and it's only really used to create the definition of gender and the most basic roles that people fall into. Next presentation or society, I think that that is an important part of gender because what societal roles one takes on largely defines how that person is perceived and their place in society so it is a more functional way to describe gender. Finally there's identity, which I think is the most important because societal roles and biology/anatomy can be changed over time identity cannot, I would feel like I should've been born a woman whether I was born in Ancient Rome, medieval Europe, the modern day Middle East, the far future on some space station, or well right now exactly where I am, it also wouldn't change with anatomy so no matter how I was born and no matter how my body changes there will always be the immutable feeling of female within my mind, I could be a bodiless mind uploaded to the cloud and my gender identity would be the same. Now with that said I think that in transsexual people (I use the word transsexual because I only want to talk about the people with the most intense feelings of gender dysphoria right now) the order or importance actually largely reverses because the most basic instincts of a person include reproductive roles so when your body doesn't fit the reproductive roles that your mind and identity set out for you, you really feel it on the most fundamental level. With society transsexual people feel the need for acceptance and feel the need to be seen as filling the roles that are expected of them as to not be reminded of their biological reality, because the biological reality is incredibly painful and harmful to a trans person's mental well-being, sometimes so much so that people feel the need to fill roles that they would prefer not to just to be accepted. The reason why identity is least important is because it is with you all your life and therefore doesn't feel like it needs to fit anything new it doesn't feel wrong so it doesn't feel important.   So why does this matter? It matters where gender comes from to have 1 the best idea how to fix it and 2 the best idea of your ideas and so are able to actually convince and show other people why they should be accepting of trans people. That's really where my model and opinions come from, convincing other people that trans people are valid and that they should be supportive and accepting, the first part of my model can be used for religious transphobes, the 'science' transphobes can be convinced by using both parts of my model, and the second part of my model can be used for TERFs or gender critical feminists. The model is actually backed up by differences in the brain and how society treats gender, it is also back up by the effectiveness of treatments for gender dysphoria or the outdated gender identity disorder, so I think that the model seems pretty valid.  Anyway that was a lot to write and I don't feel like this comment needs to be any longer so if you have any questions please ask.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"9:40 I understand your point, I argued the exact same thing to my family yesterday. I still think it's largely ignorant to claim that there aren't people representing the LGBTQ community that are detracting from the community by performing a queer identity like some people 'blackfish'.  12:46  I'm starting to dislike the way you portray the 'trender' as very calm cool and collected when if this were what the world has come to know as 'transtrenders' there would be no issue. it is because the reality of those types of people are loud, brash, IDGAF attitudes that people like Kalvin Garrah feel offended on behalf of other trans people. if 'trenders' were as you portray, the whole story would be different. I see this as a deliberate choice and I hope you respond as to why.  17:30 can you argue why someone who claims to be 'autismgender' is indeed trans? I just can't get over the fact that you don't agree that there are people appropriating trans and queer culture because it IS trendy currently.    30:00 I wonder how you reconcile those trans people who experience dysphoria. you essentially say that it is unnecessary, it is not inherent in their identity. even though many people who are trans claim to experience dysphoria. I just see this as the exact same thing you've been arguing against. you're saying to learn to believe people and accept their identity but at the same time you're discrediting the identity of some others. for example, a while back there was a lot of talk around ceasing use of modern pronouns altogether which bothered me quite a lot because my identity is wrapped up in being female. I like female pronouns and taking that away from me does harm and not good.   end - again, I see what you're saying. I guess I thought you were impartial, but the fact that detractors exist in the LGBTQ community should be addressed. I'm not talking about attack helicopters or non-binary individuals. I'm talking about people pretending to have a disability, people who pretend to be gay or trans to feel included in LGBTQ communities and then proceed to cause harm to LGBTQ individuals. I also want to ask why you would stand up for people who paint your identity as something pointless in the eyes of society. how is it okay for people to identify as autism gender and be classified as trans? I just think that although it's important to let everyone just do what they want, there is legitimate cause for concern among trans people that interlopers are trying to infiltrate the community just as the world is beginning to accept LGBTQ people.   not trying to be inflammatory, I guess I just have multiple influences and so I have some questions.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Ironically though, non binary people reinforce gender roles and perceptions by demonstrating that they can't be women or men by expressing traits from the opposite gender of the one they were born as. Nearly every woman I have met has said to me that they have, or do identify very very strongly with men. So they might as well have identified with 'non-binary'. They didn't see themselves as 'other girls', you could say - which led them to assume they were at least somewhat 'not woman' - meaning something else. But at the same time they expressed themselves sexually as women. They were comfortable with their bodies as female.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I fully agree with the underlying critique of binary transmedicalism as being a response to conservative mores and an appeal to normativity, however, I also feel that it needs to be pointed out that there are some places where non-binary non-medical trans people can overplay their hand, especially when their deconstruction of gender turns to fully denying the legitimacy of all trans medical interventions.   The other point I would like to throw into this discussion, is that the performance of normativity is, in itself a goal for many people even outside of the trans or queer communities. Many people take the performance of normativity as a good in itself, this is part of the appeal of listening to country music preoccupied by the aesthetics of tractors and dirt roads even by people whose life experience includes no such authentic experience.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hi Natalie, been following you for a while and I love your videos. Now I have an essay.   You know, despite not really needing an answer, and the fact that we should value people's humanity over putting them in a well defined box, I think I may have an answer for you. I don't know if this helps, but this is how I have always thought of it:   I think if we consider a combination of performance, identity, and biology, we can come to a working theory. It is a well known fact that it is more likely for identical twins to both identify as trans than fraternal twins, (the same goes with being gay). All male fetuses start out female, and many people are born with intersex characteristics. This proves that there is a genetic/biological basis of trans, non-binary, and gay identities.   When it comes to performance theory, people may see how this can exclude people who are gender-non conforming, and suggest that drag-queens are actually women.   But think about it like this: when a drag-queen dresses up, the intent is to 'imitate women,' not be women.   When a trans woman dresses up, she is expressing her womanhood. In both these contexts, doing the same thing, means different things for different people.   Lots of things work like this. In English for example, one word that is harmless could easily be a swear word in another language, and vice versa.   And this can extend to gender non-conformity as well: maybe one person's idea of womanhood is not the same as someone else's. One trans woman may feel that wearing dresses makes her feel feminine, while another may feel like looking like Ellen DeGeneres makes them feel like a woman.   Different things might make different people feel validated in their gender be they non-binary, gender-conforming, and/or non-gender-conforming. It all depends on how they, as individuals, were socialized, who inspires them, and how they feel about their gender. Some people may not see any tangible thing they wear, or do as inherently gendered, and simply have an inner sense of self that is important to them.   Of course, there are plenty of people who are in the closet, and who cannot openly perform and declare their identity. Are they not trans too? This is why we can't have a strict devotion to performance theory. To say that people in closet are not trans, is just as ludicrous as saying that gay people in the closet, are not really gay.   We can conclude then that although performance, and biology are certainly part of being trans, it is not the full story.   What about identification then? Some people may say that identifying as something is not enough.   How do we know we are trans then? Is it because of dysphoria? Is anyone without it just faking? I had to sit down and really think about this one, because it was very relevant to me.   How do I know I am trans if I don't always feel dysphoria?   Figuring out I was trans was a complicated process. And I would say dysphoria, for me at least, didn't start showing up until after I realized that I was. Most of the time I am actually completely comfortable with my body, and I still see myself as a trans person, when I look in the mirror.   Sometimes, when I look at my reflection, or I am laying on my bed, staring at the ceiling, I think about who I am, and how I got here. I look back into my childhood, and I think about how I realized that I liked women. It wasn't because I hated men, but rather, because I just felt an attraction to women. When I came to that realization, I started to realize the different standards we have for gay people, and trans people.   You don't have to have a hatred of men to be called a lesbian, you just have to desire women. And when you consider asexual people, that desire does not have to even be sexual, but more mental/emotional.   But it would be foolish to say for instance: 'Well, if you don't completely feel disgusted by men, (or if you are asexual), you should not become a 'trender lesbian.' You are making real lesbians look bad!' But to be trans, some people want you to prove that you completely hate your body, or you can't transition at all. Why isn't the desire to simply live as a woman/man/other enough?   'Well if they just desire to, and nothing more, doesn't that suggest it is a choice?' I hear you say. However, gay people don't desire the same sex because they choose to, but rather, because they are born that way. In a similar way, perhaps trans people's desire to transition, and/or their sense of self, is not a choice, but rather something inherent to their biology as well. Perhaps the inner sense of self that they feel/discover in regards to their gender, has a biological basis that they did not choose.   I have never met a cis person who had a serious desire/drive to become another gender. Some people may play with gender non-conformity to try, and figure themselves out, but ultimately discover that they are just gnc. Moreover, cases of de-transition are rarer than videos of the US president saying something that makes sense.   So perhaps, the only people who have a serious drive in the first place, and/or an inner sense of self, are people who are trans.   I myself didn't figure out I was trans because I hated my body. I figured it out because something a cross-dresser said in a show resonated with me as a human being. They said, 'I don't care if people see me as a boy or a girl. I want people to recognize me for who I am, rather than what sex I am.'   The gender apathy was not the thing that resonated with me, but rather, the part about being a person, rather than one of two sexes. I realized that is what I am: a person, not necessarily a boy, and not necessarily a girl.   And how do I know who I am? That question can be different for different people. But I will make the question easier by posing a different question: how does someone know they are a poet? You don't necessarily have to be good, and you don't necessarily have to hate other things that you do. You don't mind working at the quite retail store down the corner and your boss is really nice. But it doesn't fulfill you. And that's how you know you are poet: you like doing everything else, but you love and feel complete when you have finished your own epic.   Being myself, makes me feel more complete as a person, (but I still have depression, so even though there is one weight off my shoulders being my authentic self, I still feel like shit, most of the time).   A little cheesy I know, and the analogy is not meant to be taken as a direct comparison to something like sexuality and/or gender identity, (which are persecuted identities, whereas being a poet is a profession), but I hope it helps to get my point across.   So my complete hypothesis is as follows: trans people are people who have a sense of self, that is inherent to their biology, of a different gender than the one they were assigned at birth.  How they transition, (be it socially, and/or physically), is their performance, and is the beginning of their coming out in public life. Dysphoria is the discomfort some trans people may feel as a result of this.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

They seem like nothing but reactionaries blowing things out of proportion over reacting and policing who is and isn't valid.

And it sucks, bc of course at the end of the day I think that all that should be based on body autonomy- I definitely don't think dysphoria determines if you're trans, and I don't want that decision to be in the hands of medical gatekeepers or anyone else for that matter besides the person. But I struggle with how that works in our current reality, where you need a diagnosis for insurance to cover it- whether that diagnosis becomes gender incongruence, which at the end of the day is still a medical diagnosis that can be gate kept.

"I have a question about one of the points made here about the medical basis for gender dysphoria. One argument was that because Tiffany never saw a picture of her brain, she can't know she has a 'female brain' and that her dysphoria was really valid as a result of her feelings. The issue here I find is that we don't do brain scans for most mental illnesses (using mental illness as an example, don't want to have that debate right now). I have ADHD, Anxiety, and Depression and never got a brain scan for any of them. Mental illnesses are judged by their symptoms because they have predictable effects on how people feel and behave, and we don't need a full scan in order to reliably diagnose them. If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, we don't need to sequence its genome to reliably predict that it is a duck. I imagine it is much the same with diagnosing dysphoria. Obtaining a medical diagnosis with mental illness is important because we have an inherently skewed view of ourselves, and tend to have heavy biases when it comes to our own emotional state. This is why self-diagnosis is extremely dangerous when it comes to mental illness, and why I cringed a little bit at the insinuation that Tiffany's reliance on professional medicine to treat her dysphoria was using 'a man in a lab coat signing a prescription pad' to feel valid.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I kinda wish we called gender dysphoria 'sex dysphoria' instead, since for many of us, it really has to do with the sex characteristics of our body, not how society recognizes us as man or woman.  That being said, this really resonates with me, as I strongly identify with a lot of what Tiffany Tumbles says, and yet I also agree with the attacks on her positions. I do so badly just want to be seen as normal, to be treated as normal, and so it is easy to try to throw someone else under the bus to get that acceptance. It just hurts when sometimes even allies seem to treat me like I'm not really a woman, even though they use the right pronouns and name for me.   Even recently, I was on a beach trip with a bunch of LGBTQ+ friends, and of the two houses we were renting, they initially put me in the house with all of the gay guys instead of with the queer women. I can't count how many times I have felt broken and lied to by similar events, like people see me as a woman, but they don't see me as female, so I still get viewed and treated as a guy, and the accepting treatment I get is all surface level. I think Tiffany Tumbles feels this pain, as do lots of transmed-leaning trans women who look to someone to blame for our exclusion from cis women social groups.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Okay, so how do we make a non-binary inclusive society when our bathrooms/locker rooms, shelters, sports, and clubs, etc. are gender segregated?  Dismantling all of that would be complete, and utter chaos!  With the way our society is currently set up, transmedicalism, and the gender binary needs to be valid in order for us trans women to have access to female spaces, and trans men to have access to male spaces, as well as in order to receive free/low cost transitional related health services, for those of us poor trans people who wouldn't have access to those health services otherwise.     At some point, as trans people we have to adapt, conform, and fall inline to societal norms.  I tell ignorant cis-hets all the time (those who accuse me of being trans for the sake of seeking attention), while I'm transitioning so that I have a physical outer representation of my inner being, my transition is also for the purpose of passing and adapting to societal norms.

"This isn't the case for everyone, obviously, but the vast majority of nonbinary people I've met genuinely seem like they're doing it for attention or to feel special. The way they talk about it is actually really reminiscent of the showy Christians I know who never shut the fuck up about their relationship with God and constantly 'correct' me if I say 'the lord's name in vain,' all for the purpose of appearing very godly. I would never put down someone's identity to their face or tell them they're not valid, but when 'nonbinary' or 'Christian' or anything else is literally the only facet of your identity... it's hard for me to take you seriously.

That I can't be non-binary until I PRESENT myself to society as non-binary which is honestly toxic as fuck.   But she kinda bring it back around to what I believe that there really doesn't NEED to be a theory on how or why gender is the way it is. It's like love, like sexuality, like everything else in nature, it defies labels and categorization at least.  Her arguments go all over the place and if she's trying to reach the centrists (which she prides herself on being able to do) who are on the fence wondering whether or not multiple genders really ARE a thing then I don't think she's going to reach them.

"while this is about to be a very long comment and not an academic peer-reviewed paper how's this for your scientific explanation: mirror neurons. Those are the braincells that allow us to learn from fellow humans by imitating their behaviour, feeling empathy and understanding abstract concepts that only exist in language and not in the physical world. When parents teach children manners, or when a kid tries to emulate their favourite superhero or character, the human tendency to divide each other as in-group/out-group, those are all behaviours that help build in individual identity that also relates to the world around them, it's a thing that definitely doesn't stop when we reach adulthood, aligning ourselves with peers who feel are similar to ourselves or represent ideas we agree with is the building block of society. Gender as a social construct is one of the many ways we communicate our inner self to the world around us, leaving aside the performative theory that deals more with the mind-body problem, genders are social roles (gender roles are the generalization of this) that encompass traits one feels align with the self and likens the self to others, there are people who have a tendency to take care of others, the friend mom they're called, which is an unnecessary imposition of gender to a trait that is likely to be encountered in mothers but that oesn't mean other people can't be nurturing as well, we are all aware that not all mothers embody the charecteristic that make someone ''motherly'', seeing other people being caring and wanting to be like that too, it's an aspiration to a certain role in society. Any personality trait that has social consequences, like leadership or compassion or humor,  any one individual can have a bunch of these and recognize in their surroundings who is like them and who is unlike them, gender in society has more to do with who you relate to, all the unique combinations of variables that construct a person can exist without gender, the tendency of certain traits clumping together by the bunch makes the group unified through them seem like a clear type of person but that mix is more correlation than causation. If fathers really didn't have a single nurturing bone in their bodies whichever statistically outlier moms that were not caring wouldn't have succeded at raising babies and perpetuating their genes, but it wasn't so, as has been pointed out by science before humans and society have consequences on our species that go beyond the most logically convenient actions, graves in cultures areoung the world prove that disabled people were taken care of by their tribes far into their lives despite being ''of no use to the survival of the group'', because humans form bonds among them, as long as the sentient mind can distinguish between the self and the other, there will be groups of people united by similarities, and transness is easily one of those cases, where sometimes what happens first is feeling otherness where you're being told there's similarity, some people who wear glasses are not super smart some people who do time-consuming art have a short-fuse when people anger them, people who are very socially active can be generally disliked; simply put one single trait in a person, whether they form groups based on it or not, is ultimately insufficient to understanding them as a whole, and the binary proposes absolutes that don't respond to the actual complexity of the human mind and experience.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I used to be a truscum. I think the catalyst was Mr. Garrah posting a tweet of another trans man jokingly saying 'trans guys have the best p*ssy.', crying about how it gave him (garrah) second hand dysphoria, and the rest of the comments agreed. I felt like the only one stopping to think 'Wait, had he not posted it to his hundreds of followers, wouldn't you have just not seen it? Is this not how transphobes talk about our bodies- in disgust?' It hit me then. This was nearly a year ago. When you started talking about bullied becoming bully, I flashbacked to my middle school years, where I did not have the language to describe how I was feeling, but was asked near daily 'What are you?', called 'it', what have you. At some point I started asking them what answer they wanted, because it seemed they were always disappointed or skeptical no matter the answer. When I did eventually come out, I couldn't medically transition till 4 years after. I believe this might be why I was so heavy transmed. I had all MY insecurities and MY dysphoria bubbling up and the constant need to prove my manhood to not only myself but other people was a fight I was tired of having. I don't want to drag this on too long. This was just very eye opening and incredibly accurate.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

They claim tucutes are all white (which is funny, because all the truscum I've ever met were white) and that tucutes mock autistic people.  This is ridiculous - autistic people are even more likely to be nonbinary than to be binary trans.  I never expected cishets to accept me, and you know what?  Many of them have.  Conversely, I never expected trans people to reject, hate, and publicly mock me, but they often do.  Thus, I no longer really even call myself trans.

"I'm nonbinary and some of these arguments really hurt and hit home. I'm really glad you talked about this. I'm a very logic-oriented person, and I like to think there's a reason for everything, including all things LGBTQ+. I genuinely believe there is a logical reason people are gay or trans or any other kind of queerness, but I have always been content with 'we just don't have the advancements to get confirmation of that yet' as is the case with a lot of psychology, and think it's best to in the meantime just believe people because they know themselves better than I do. But for some reason, it never really registered that while most people have a similar view to me about gay people, they don't use the same line of thought for trans people.   And I don't understand why.   Why aren't we trusted to just be what we say? And even if we aren't who does it hurt? Why does it matter to others so much? Why are we so different from other queer people when we too were born this way? Why are nonbinary trans people thought of as delusional and binary trans people forced into a box of performative behaviors or they 'aren't really trans'? I don't understand, I'm confused, and society is bullshit. Can't we all have both logic AND empathy?

"So, I am one of those truscum'ers.   Yes, I believe that transsexualism is a category and therefore has definable characteristics which then must exclude; but it doesn't then make the excluded invalid in regards to what ever category they fall into. I don't think it's then ok to be an ass-hat to gender-queer people; most of which are focused on social gender things, which are rather flexible, so it's not unreasonable by any means. I simply see them being in different categories, with some shared aspects. We have a common thing tho, which is that once upon a time, there was zero way of physically transitioning, and the only thing one could do was use social aspects of gender... which seems to account for other cultures 3rd genders; it's not like trans people were accepted as women/men back then. Many trans-people do feel mocked, that someone who is 'happy' with their body, but doesn't want to be femme (dresses/acts less stereotypically girl) has equal claim to 'the trans identity'... which leads us to: Gender-dysphoria, perhaps the main reason, but it's not as simple as that. Gender-dysphoria is not exclusive to trans people: in youth it can manifest from one's difficulty navigating gender/sexuality (60-90% desistance rates, which is from about 11 papers on the subject) to someone being abused. Basically, having GD doesn't automatically make you trans (which is part of a larger conversation). I no longer experience gender dysphoria... and I am still very much trans. Yes, I have had SRS, and obviously take hormones. So what is GD to a transsexual girl? Well, I can anecdotally describe my own experience (along with conversations I have had with dozens of trans women and men). GD is defined as being both in relation to one's body and social, which holds up...but I don't think they are equal from my own exp (along with others). Being socially recognized is great, but when you are naked and alone, you still have GD... despite being called miss all day. I was rather 'passing' before HRT, so I got lots of social validation... but it never made up for how I felt in relation to my body, even how testosterone made me feel (which was anxious, so very anxious from puberty to transitioning, because I felt 'off' a few months into HRT, poof gone, when I had to stop HRT and my T lvs when up, poof same feelings).  Now, you can say 'it's a medical construct' and modern therefore it's 'the trend' or it's the first time in history that trans-people has a way to actually manifest themselves fully. Before I knew what gender dysphoria was, along with being trans... I felt like a girl, having a penis seemed extremely weird, and when I hit puberty I found myself in descending into hell.  Yes, I love my transmedialismnesss; I feel like I am very lucky to exist at this point in time where I am able to see myself fully, rather than being trapped in hell.  Now, the idea of right brain, wrong body was dismissed.. casually, without real evidence... that that was a rather weak point. No one has seen their chromosomes, how do they even know they are XX or XY? OMG! *mind blown*.  There are studies to that point this this theory as being a possibility. The larger proof of theory are intersex people. Unfortunately many people with this condition have been coin flipped, and it was wrong.. the positive is that it does show that an individual cannot just be force gendered into being a 'girl' or a 'boy', there is something innate, or else no intersex person would have transitioned (trans people also reinforce this). Which kinda leads to transsexualism being most likely a type of (or strongly related to) intersex, either genetic or developmental.   Yes, trans people often want a bedrock to their identity, because it's stronger than I feels this way. But, really the argument against us is a biological one, and it's forced on us that I need to have the most empirically sound reasoning for my existence. Yes, gay people are not required to have a biological reasoning, but well.... being gay is rather obvious, and the proof is that you are a girl who only likes girls or a boy that only likes boys. Being trans seems rather nebulous to many people; or to the other extreme that biology is being ignored aka science denial. I fulfill most of the social aspects of being a girl, while not being a complete biological girl, but to our best knowledge it most likely I do have a biological reason of why I am this way. I am not a girl in a proper sense  (not Plato's ideal form by any means), I am the perfectly imperfect type, born from the messiness that can arise from biology. I am just going to post, I am getting bored by this.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Honestly, I don't follow what's wrong with the performative theory. Is a male actor playing a woman as much of a woman as Justine and other transgender women are? No, but his character is. His character is a much a woman as any fictional woman. In fact, if 'he' _never_ stopped portraying the character, then the character would become the new reality and our actor would effectively have transitioned. Obviously, if we stick to gender being sociological construct, which I do, then we pose a bit of a requirement that society defines your gender as opposed to you. This understandably seems uncomfortable to many. It feels like an unjust burden that one must have society recognize a gender, before you can be considered part of it. It's certainly something cis people don't have to deal with so what the fuck? Still, if the reason you're even discussing this publicly with people is because you want recognition, then it effectively becomes the same struggle. I simply believe that it possible for members of society, and therefor society itself, to become accepting of people transitioning between the binaries and existing between/beyond them. After all, I'm personally an example of such.    However, I'm also really, really dumb, and there might have been several points I've missed here. It's not like I was even familiar with performative theory as a term in this context before this video.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I feel like transmeds don't realize how much of gen z is conservative... When I came out as trans my friends immediately went, 'But you know you have to have dysphoria, right? Are you sure? Ok just don't become all 'uwu spacegender' on me haha.' (For context: I first came out as nb, but then came out as ftm a few months later) Even now, my friends call me 'ma'am,' 'lady,'  address me by my given name, or even try to get me to wear women's clothing and underwear.   I know I can't make a fuss, because then I'll be being 'a triggered SJW,' but it really agonizing just trying to talk to them. It still feels like no one believes me - which make me think, 'Am I lying to myself? Is this really just for attention?'   So even though being referred to as female makes my insides crinkle up like wet toilet tissue, I'm still doubting I'm 'real.' I know absolutely no one who is willing to validate me or encourage me to transition. No one. This might be just because I live in the Bible belt, but oof, this transmed ideology that there's a whole subgroup of 'SJW transtrenders' taking over the world is absolutely, without a doubt, untrue.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I love how Tiffany and Justine can learn things from eachother. Justine learns that she can be a trans lesbian and she can express however she wants, in the end she will still be a woman, no matter what she wears or who she loves. Not conforming to female stereotypes doesn't make you non binary, a woman is still a woman whether she waers dresses or suits, whether she likes men or women. And Tiffany learns that there doesn't have to be a reason why trans people exist or are the way they are, just like gay people. They just exist, and we have to accept them. Fantastic video, loved it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"The classical liberal principles of 'live and let live' and 'it's nobody's business what you do or how you identify so long as you don't hurt anyone' are what come to mind when it comes to this issue. That's the real reason (and not science) why I've always been accepting and respectful towards both trans and non binary people whom I've met in person.   That being said, you grossly misrepresented the perspective of the centrist in this video. The issue that centrists (at least center right and those who lean towards classical liberalism) have with trans people and non-binary people isn't whether these identities are valid... but whether it's OK to, for example, pass a law in Canada saying that not using a person preferred pronoun is illegal, or taking children out of the custody of their parents if the child has gender confusion and the parent doesn't want their child to undergo chemical castration, and yes - also enabling and encouraging adolescent kids as well as prepubescent kids to make mistakes that they'll most likely regret for the rest of their lives. Not to mention getting people fired and arrested (in the UK) if you don't respect their pronouns on twitter, etc', etc', etc'. The problem with that kind of stuff... is that it violates your end of 'live and let live'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hello! the cis-male target audience here. I got a series of questions and I need the help of anyone with their answers (fact, feels I count both). ALERT! This is not mockery, I am just confused and curious.  1) Could a transgender be transgender and gay at the same time? Like I think they could but is it a thing?  2) How would you describe being bi-gender? It's like 'I know there are man and woman but I am neither' or more like 'I am a woman in man's body and I like it (vise versa).  3) How the hell is it with that gender x sex thing in the minds of trans people? Like if gender is not conditioned by sex than how the hell we ended up with the idea that it kinda is? I could get behind the idea that the experience of my existence is exclusively my own but I also sympathize with the idea that this experience is conditioned by the physical reality around me. I know this dilemma was part of the video but what are your thoughts? For me, it's hard to wrap my head around the idea that it's just totally random and everything happens. Could practical reality for some person be like 'I am Female (sex) I want to make babies someday, I like boys but my gender is a man, or something else?'  4) For a transgender person, what is an overall ideal goal of the discussion about this? Is it 'Gender was always just man-made thing and there is no reason why not tweak it or throw it away' or something like 'Yap, Females are usually girls by design, but not always, get on with it.'  Thank for any answers. I know that a lot of this is riding around in ContraPoints videos but I want to hear ideas and experiences of other people.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've read a little bit (and with a little bit, I mean a *little* bit) about third genders in non-western cultures, and I often felt that for many of these people, if they were born in 'the West', they would've probably felt reasonably at home in a binary trans framework.  But the thing is, they weren't born in the West, and they grew up with a cultural framework that explained the same -or very similar feelings- in a different way. A way that they now probably feel more comfortable with, since that's what they grew up with.  People like Tiffany try so hard to strictly define gender. To describe and catalogue it, and put it in a nice rigid box that is the same for everyone across the world, but I don't think it works that way. Personally, I get the idea that, while the feelings (for lack of a better word) underlying gender dysphoria and transgenderism are probably the same across cultures, the way these feelings are expressed, and how they take shape is probably strongly influenced by cultural factors.  This is kind of how I see the current emergence of non-binary genders too. Maybe a lot of enby people would have been comfortable as cis or binary trans people in another time, or another cultural framework. Maybe they would've been able to express their gender by being gender non-conforming or doing drag or having a fetish, without attaching a trans identity to it. Or maybe not? Either way, the cultural framework is shifting to one that allows for that ambiguity. It's a new 'shape' to pour those feelings in, and I honestly think it is only a matter of time before this shape becomes as embedded in our culture as third genders are in their respective cultures. It's a cultural change and I don't think it's a bad one. In fact, I think it's pretty cool. And hell, maybe one day it will shift again, and all the future people will think we're idiots.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I first started questioning my gender identity in 2013, and figured it was very possible I could be nonbinary. I saw the kind of backlash 'transtrenders' got and decided I was one of them, so I figured if I just ignored my dysphoria it would go away and I would become the cis female that people were telling me I was. Well, fast forward 6 years later, it did NOT go away, and now I'm still questioning my gender identity. I think if I could have seen a video like this back in the day (especially coming from a trans person I admire like you) I would have felt a lot more confident and wouldn't have fallen so hard into self hatred and isolation for so many years.

Do you need to suffer from depression and anxiety as a result for it count as 'real' dysphoria? If someone were to wake up one day and realize that their lived experience doesn't match the box they were born into, is that not enough?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"But if gender roles do dissapear, or at least are greatly diminished, wouldn't that make 'breaking the rules' functionally impossible, therefore ending the possibility of gender non-binary identities? Becuase to me (as someone who does not really buy non-binary gender indentities), it seems that this performative view is predicated on a bunch of irracional (and sometimes homophobic/transphobic) assumptions about what it means to be a 'man'. For example, as a gay man, I have quite many behaviours that are socially considered 'non-masculine', and many that are, but that does not mean that I simply stop being a man (and that is a very commonly used insult where I'm from, that Gay men aren't 'Real men' because they don't perform all of the stupid irracional rules that suposedly make you man, like not liking competitive sports, which is parcially why I'm very restrictive to the SJW sociologist theories), and that I'm 'presenting' as non-binary. In fact, there are plenty of man that I know that put in the extra effort to be androginous, and to break gender norms, but never do they claim to not be men.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

In all seriousness, though, the argument regarding the provability and validity of gender identity is on point, but treating 'trans trenders' solely as people  who are in early stages of transition and figuring out their identity is somewhat misleading. In the video 'Why I'm No Longer Non-Binary', Roly claims that there are people in the trans community who are going with the pronouns and the highly imaginative genders literally just for the attention and are completely different in private. Anecdotal evidence, I know, but shouldn't such people, assuming they exist, be called out for their BS?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Wow, I think that was the darkest stuff you've ever done. In cabbalistic judaism or Kabbalah there is concept of qliphoth - the evil arising from the deformation of the holy. Rather than outright cartoonish evilness (which in the view of Kabbalah is not the real evil in the world, but only the human wrong perception), the source of bad things is all that looks like good (wisdom, rationality, compassion, justice, effort and triumph) but through slight deviation leads to suffering. And I think this why this video is so terrifying. You show not the cartoonish villians, but characters one can easily confound for being the voice of reason or compassion (and from the comments it sadly looks like it is truly the case) lest one allow for even slightest compromise with sin.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think one of the key tensions here is a... well, western desire for reductionism. If we can appeal to some form methodology that relies on a positivist, mechanistic certainty, it's intuitively easier to swallow. A -> B therefore C. The problem is this type of metaphysics often leads to the type of exclusion and bigotry displayed here. The notion that the world and by extension biology are fixed, pregiven and linear, and any deviation from that model is the result of our own epistemic limitations rather than an underlying fluidity or reciprocal relational metaphysics is a staple of American culture. Personally I feel an approach that ontologises epistemology, or has a more methodological individualism at it's center empowers and legitimizes the lived experiences of many oppressed groups, and liberates everyone else from those stringent, realist structures they force themselves to adhere to, often becoming a detriment to themselves and others.

"TLDW: Natalie eventually decides that we shouldn't have to justify our existence as trans people, because no one else has to do it. Gay people are just gay, they don't have to justify their sexualities with essentially 'gayscum and gaycute'. they just exist as valid people. Likewise, the same goes with any other facets of being human. People who love literature aren't, nor shouldn't have to, debate over if they're 'bookscum or bookcute', etc.  By debating our right to exist via trucute, truescum, etc. arguments, we're essentially validating that there's even an argument to be had over whether we exist or not. Which is gross, we do exist, and we have a right to exist. Full stop. We should be respected at that level at least.   Plus, the moment you open this to debate to prove it's real, you'll find that you can't logically prove it's real, the same way you can't logically prove that loving someone else is real, and attempting to do so is just degrading.  So I guess the idea she's trying to get across in the end is when someone says 'prove you're valid', just don't play the game, and say 'i'm the gender I say I am'  Ofc, this may not be Natalie's actual point of view, she's said before that the characters are often more arguments she's having in her head than her fully formed opinion, but considering how the episode is structured and how Justine lays out the closing arguments, which starts at 29:04 , it really seems this is the core argument Natalie is trying to make.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Trans-medicalism is just trash at the end if you game it out... it's no different from saying people with penises can't be women. Do you really think there is enough of a difference between cishet, gay, transgender, etc. brains that you would be able with enough technology to scan brains and be able to consistently and perfectly tell the difference between brains? What if someone who claims to be totally queer gets their brain scanned and comes up cishet? Do we accuse them of lying, of trying to sneak into women's bathrooms?     Being transgender is not some clear physical hardwire in your brain, nor is it a purely performative act in a social construct, nor is it a spiritual soul-shift. Its people who live in a specific culture with a specific history and specific language being uncomfortable with that specific culture's proscribed gender role for them. If they feel uncomfortable but can't perform it for whatever reason, then they are still transgender. If they are simply dabbling in it because its trendy and they like campy fashion, then they become transgender as soon as they decide that they are less comfortable more comfortable with those proscribed roles. The real philosophical question comes when there is no proscribed roles, one could claim the very idea of transgender in such a world would be obsolete.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think there are different takeaways from this even though it's leaning more as a criticism of 'traditional' trans mindset over 'trender' mindset.   I'm a center-right biological male so I obviously lean more toward understanding why Tiffany Tumbles is being super critical of trenders, but I also understand the flip side better now and I think this video actually brings up a good point of why people can't stand 'non-binary attack helicopters'.  The answer is simple: they fucking suck. No one cares that they believe in a million genders. No one care if your put flowers and glitter in your beard. They just have the same effect of an over-zealous yoga instructor: they're just the fucking worst.  This was brought up in the interview too but never really got delved into. What made Baltimore Maryland so obnoxious was the fact that every question to 'they' was turned around into another question. That is the exact mentality on non-binary attack helicopters, they will never give you a straight answer (even just in polite conversation) and live only to be an enigma that you aren't allowed to ask about. That's part of why trans-trenders are almost infallible; they present themselves so assuredly yet you aren't ever able to get a clear answer from them about exactly what they're presenting. The way it seems is that their mystery is their biggest armor and if you can't properly identify them then they see it as a win in an imaginary game.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I find funny how conservatives and anti-sjw talk about feelings like if they were an imaginary unicorn term and not a very real thing produced by your brain, with serious consequences in our lives and other people's lives.  Besides, science is about making hypothesis by observing the world. If there are people who claim to not to be their birth gender or even non-binary, the scientific way to approach the situation is to analyse the facts to try to come up with an explanation for that reality. About transgenderism, there are many studies about the topic, but the answers are still not clear. Science is not dogmatic, if its explanations contradict reality (like, in this case, it's a reality that there are non-binary and trans people), science has to find new ways to explain this reality. To call non-binary and trans people nosense and imaginary it's not only rude, but also anti-scientific, because it ignores a reality.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I understand that it can help with communication but I dare to say it's far from mandatory.  'That guy over there in the t-shirt and jeans.' can be said just as clearly but saying 'That person over there with short black hair in the t-shirt and jeans.'  What situation is the use of gender helpful or required?  What's a real argument not to abolish gender?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think a lot of this confusion comes from a place that expects our social categorizations to be objective facts. Gender doesn't work in an uniform way and even though I think there are (partly) biological causes for these constructs they are a set of independent variables that can develop differently in each individual and be decoded distinctively according to social constructs. Non-binaries just seem to classify their particular psychological structure in unconventional ways. It can be a bit arbitrary, but our concept of binary genders are mostly arbitrary as well. I guess my views better align with the catgirl.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I kinda miss hearing the actual argument? Rather than this weird condescending strawman sketch?   I think the topic is interesting though. We have gender dysphoria, a psychological concept that has received testing and has gotten a good portion of scientific backing. It is a (relatively) observable symptom, as in you can do similar tests as you do for depression. And no, we do not see the brain to test for either, because frankly, the tech/science isn't there yet. It doesn't mean we can't (approximate) a psychological diagnosis of both. This indirectly observable symptom, when present, clearly indicates that a person is trans. Or depressed. But yes. That leads to a diagnosis, treatment, and a good way to formalize it all. We can say with relatively confidence that trans people exist, and are not simply strongly believing something to be true.   The same is not necessarily true for non-binary people. Now, to be fair, the science isn't in yet there what so ever. They might be proven to exist as well. Assuming that they're relatively proven to not exist, they're still not hurting anyone by dressing up in whatever way they want. I mean, it wouldn't make sense to subsidize surgery, but beyond that, let them live their life to the fullest. I mean, having to use 'they/them' is probably pretty annoying to sound out in replacement of the relatively quick he/she, but besides that, I'm on board. Just because they believe in something that doesn't exist, doesn't mean it's hurtful. It's an identity, like a national identity, which fills people's life with meaning. And if they're proven to exist over the next couple of years or decades, then that's all the better.   My main point is that there is a distinction to be made between that which exists, and that which we identify as. The reason you can't ignore being trans is because it exists. Even if you will it away and never really knew it was a thing, it'll be a thing. If non-binary exists, the same should be the case there - haunting you even when you look away. Meanwhile, while we may feel strongly with what we identify with (ie: nationality), if we didn't want to identify with it from one moment to the next, we would simply be able to change our identity at a whim (Perhaps including some emotional outburst, but yeah). That doesn't make the identity wrong or evil, however - it's a valid expression of our personality like any other expression.   So yeah, I agree with none and all of the weird strawmen in that show. I guess that's what centrism does to yah, eh?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I have to wonder, why is there this need for 'social policing'? And furthermore, why is it so mainstream in our current society? Gender and orientation can be important on a personal and close interpersonal level... but in the big picture it is irrelevant. At least from my perspective. I functionally don't care what gender or orientation some person is that I don't know -- and even of the people I know, it doesn't matter (in regard to being able to communicate with them) we get into the question of 'do I want to have a sexual interaction with this person?' as well as 'who am I?'       Why is so much energy spent, on the level of _The Public,_ trying to minimize or de-legitimize or even outlaw anything that strays even a little bit from 'the standard' setup our current society has certified as ... standard?       There must be some connection to power. Some need to maintain a given status quo or given mindset so that those with power can maintain it. That's the only motivation that makes sense to me... and yet still this resistance to 'some people are different' makes no sense. I don't think capitalism cares... no directly. Rather, it's the folks who are trained by religion and social norms derived from religion who care so greatly that they will collectively revolt from the capitalist reigns if those who are 'different' are accepted. Okay... so that gives the motivation for the capitalists enforcing (and reinforcing) this needless opposition and cruelty. But what of 'religion' of which we all know we're talking about Abrahamic religion in particular (Christy, Muslimy, Ortho-J), and even then not all adherents. Mostly it's those who have _use_ of their religion not for personal beliefs or self improvement reasons... but as a tool for asserting authority over others. And now it clicks together for me. It's not really an issue with religion, but with those seeking power over others and just using religion as a rather convenient tool. And one way to implement that power is to have people 'join your side' against a threat. So it's helpful to find and label threats, because if everything is fine and there are no threats, people stop bothering doing as you say because... well, everything's fine and they don't need you to guide them. And obviously you can't point to the corporations, wealthy elites, and the capitalist system in general as a threat because that's a large part of how you build and maintain your power. So it helps to find 'fringe' groups, minorities, to point out as a threat. They won't be able to provide a meaningful counter attack because they are few in number and if you can keep the pressure on, they also will be kept at a disadvantage within capitalism. Keep them ostracized, engender mistrust of them among those you 'lead' and never forget to paint them as a threat. Because again, if there isn't a threat to unite against, your followers will disperse over time or come up with their own ideas you can't use as leverage.       Naturally this means there's a part of society that is kept relatively isolated and off balance. They have questions like 'what the hell is gender, even?' They might wonder 'why are certain shapes or colors of clothes not allowed to be worn by some kinds of people?' 'Why does it matter which two people decide to kiss or love each other?' 'Why does it matter how that person looks?' 'Why does it matter what body language another person adopts?'       Among the 'I'm just asking questions' crowd, there are certain questions they don't want anyone to ask. They certainly don't like genuine and open questions, either. They far prefer leading questions... that lead where they want. To maintain a status quo with them holding much if not all of the power.  =.=.=.=.=.=.=.=.=.=.=.=.=.=.=.=.=.=.= Love your videos, Natalie. They always get me thinking.

"It's kind of hilarious how this straight up became Socratic argumentation that I have so far not seen laid out to this extent on this channel. It might be the only Socratic debate I've seen on Youtube. This could easily be a short story, but the production value is so good here. And though as a nonbinary Filipino myself (if you want a couple more examples of modern non-binary gendered systems, the Philippines have had 'bakla' for a long time, which is considered an additional gender) I have scoffed at celebrities for glittering their beards and dressing in barely-different clothing for lavish photoshoots, it's more because being nonbinary has been only really visible via celebrities, and that commodification of gender expression is what irritates me. I worry that we'll be seen as trendy shit reserved for the affluent because that's what the magazines are showing us--that we're just following the examples of out-of-touch Hollywood elites. Like you present in the video, I don't mind gender exploration, though I sort of have mixed feelings on the argument that nonbinarism can be sort a sort of game lobby between transitioning to either man or woman, but it is important, and only presenting it through the context of celebrities and not average people is going to make us the target of bullies like the one you present.  Which is why I sort of took issue with presenting Baltimore Maryland as being the most cartoonish, trend-invoking stereotype, but I think I understand that the point is to present the absolute furthest logical conclusion of what looks like a 'transtrender' person so that when they present a strong argument, it becomes clear that even the most caricatured stereotype understands what they're doing, or even if they don't, are fully within their rights and their identities are valid.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Honestly, performitivity theory scares me... I'm a cis woman (I think, not sure) and people tell me I 'act like a boy' all the time. So, if gender is social, does that make me a man?   And if gender is biological, psychological and social, am I just... ambiguous? Because biologically, I'm female (even though I haven't had a brain scan lol) if we're going by the 'evidence' of genitalia, socially, I'm quite ambiguous, and psychologically, I don't know what the fuck is going on because I don't trust my own thoughts and feelings.

If someone is 18, and they're not trans but they want to go on hormones that will permanently change their body, that is their choice. That is freedom.   If they're under 18, at the very least why would it be a problem for them to socially transition? Cis boys and girls don't have to hide their gender identity.   I'm not well versed on puberty blockers so I can't speak to that, but it seems this whole issue springs from children going on hormone therapy, which I don't think happens very much, certainly not enough to make such a fucking thing over it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'll throw my two cents in the ring; I think of myself as transsexual because that's what I have dysphoria about--my sex characteristics and body, not any socially constructed gender or gender role. The parts of socially constructed gender that cause me gender dysphoria are due to being raised in a society where certain clothes, hobbies, haircuts, etc have been conflated with a persons biological sex. Whenever I hear people like Baltimore talk about being neither man or woman/inbetween both/a mix of the two, they always seem to be talking about gender roles and the social construct of gender. If we woke tomorrow in a post gender world, would Baltimore still feel the need to call themselves transgender? Or would they just be a person expressing themselves how they want? In a post gender world, I (and I'm guessing people like Tiffany Tumbles) would still have sex dysphoria. We would still need hrt and srs for our mental and physical wellbeing. None of this makes any one group more right or 'valid' than the other. We're just two different groups of people. The only thing we share in common is taking on a different socially constructed gender.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"How many truncated binaries for the sake of argument are there here. Gender can be a social construct and have a basis in neurology. Mental disorder called gender dysphoria has been diluted and changed itself from the DSM III gender identity disorder to gender dysphoria. This can be so disabling for some of us that it is seen as a disability under the Americans with Diabilities act.  Non binary is real. But that does not mean transtrenders aren't real and transitory. And diluting or trivializing the struggles of transgender or transsexual persons.   My brain has had some imaging done and there were slight differences detected by accident. Then there are developmental signs usually early on that often come to light in adolescence. None of this means I am mental disorder. I may have one by definition. I do feel pain.  I did not sit down at age four and decide on my gender. Did anyone here? No?  Look at language. If born in China of the fifth century I would be speaking a dialect of Chinese. Yet, cognitive science strongly indicates there is an innate neurological structure for language, that is conditioned and developed via culture. Remember Noam Chomsky dear Contra?  Perhaps gender expression is not hard wired as language yet sexual dimorphism is there as is attachment to bio males or females in early development. Gender dysphoria is something generated from a natural phenomena and social construction of gender. Then, dysphoria is also created by the imposition, often via coercion,  of rigid gender roles. Oh I won't go into intersex conditions.yet.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

So they eagerly adopt the view that their brain was struck, by pure happenstance, by some malfunction that makes you feel like you would if people were shitty to you.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"That was a great video as always! Just like 'Tiffany Tumbles' - the first half being fairly light-hearted while still covering deep topics and the second half just going into existential dread. And I cannot stress that conclusion enough:'Just be compassionate to everyone' I do have one hang-up though that kinda prevents me from agreeing to all arguments 100%: Even if people agree that being transgender is valid and that being non-binary is valid (which I both do!), there can still be a disagreement if 'transgender' should be an umbrella category for people who fit into the binary and people who don't. Personally I see them more as sister terms - both real identities, but with no overlap. I don't know if that's a common opinion, but a lot of these problems wouldn't occur that way. (A whole lot would still be there, of course!) And I felt like that wasn't addressed in the video. But that's relatively minor! I still really liked it!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I agree with the nb person in the debate mostly. But, I am a socially, medically, legally transitioning nonbinary person and I admit it can be frustrating to see some people who aren't transitioning at all take up a lot of space away from the most vulnerable nb people and avoid accountability. Ive seen a lot of nontransitioning afab nb feminine people who only date cis men say that cishet men who are attracted to them should call themselves queer and be in queer only spaces. Ive seen nontransitioning white nb identifying people refuse to look at privilege or racism because 'well I'm actually nb so...'   I feel like I have nothing in common with them. I feel like genderqueer (which is pretty much what people call nb today) became so watered down just like the word queer has (cishet poly or kinky people claiming they're queer because they're into bdsm.)   So basically the nb representation in this is not representing the nb identifying people who sometimes get on my nerves. I don't think we need to necessarily police identity, but we need to have a WAY bigger conversation than trans or not trans. The nb person portrayed in this video is gonna deal with a thousand times more shit than a nontransitioning person who presents and dates exactly how their assigned sex is expected to in mainstream society.   The make up and video quality is on point as always. If anyone made it this far thanks for reading and I'm open to discussion.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Nonbinary is silly because you have to identify as it. It makes any gender-conforming person proclaiming they're non-binary seem more GNC than people who don't know what gender is (or don't care) but are GNC in their actions and personnality. It pushes those people in two binary boxes without even their knowledge or consent.  Gender makes no sense, it has no basis in reality or biology. That's why you feel bad in it (and also it's the ndeg1 tool of mysogyny). And in reality, everyone feel bad in it. It's and oppressive structure that we should free everyone from. Non-binary is just a personnal indivudual response to a systemic oppression. It'll never work.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Did anyone see the Bill Maher show a while back? A guest came on the show with the title of 'sexual neuroscientist', her name was Dr Soh, and she had a lot to say about the trans topic. I thought it might have been interesting until she started her statement with 'Im not transphobic, I dont think Im transphobic BUT-' and thats never a good sign... The debate was about trans kids and how (as she says) 'science proves that a lot of the time trans kids arent trans, theyre gay' along with many other statements claiming that being trans is a trend people use for clout. I think her arguments might be worth discussion, or she could be ignored im ok either way.

"I actually did the opposite. I was 18 before I realized transgender was a real thing and not just a joke and 22 before I realized there were more than two genders at all. I was saying that I was a gay guy trapped in a female body from the time I was 12 to 18 and then from 18 to 22 sort of thought I was a trans man but never really felt like 'man' fit me much better than 'woman' did. So I went to Gay Straight alliance meetings and let everyone assume I was a straight ally because I didn't know how to express how monumentally unsure I was about my very existence and it felt like saying I was trans was undermining what other trans people felt. Finding out about non-binary genders made me feel so much better about myself. It finally felt like something fit.   So I'm gender neutral with a slight leaning towards the masculine mentally but physically I present more feminine because my hips look much better in women's clothing. One day I hope to get a double mastectomy because I feel some dysphoria towards my breasts but that's probably the only transitioning I'll ever do. It's more the societal expectations that really bother me. And the funniest thing to me is that I have to take spironolactone and estrogen in order to treat my hormonal acne. The one thing I've pretty much always been sure of is that I'm not a woman and I take the same stuff a lot trans women end up taking for hrt (probably at lower doses, but still)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The unfortunate part about this is I had a breakdown about how the hell I exist. I feel like I need an explanation to why I, a transgender non-binary, exist. I believed the transmedicalists 100% because they were able to validate me via me having dysphoria. I felt like I belonged in a community that hated me- that I can be valid. Now I'm just unsure and having a mental breakdown- what do I do and how should I believe? I want an explanation and if there is none how the fuck do I exist?  Now I'm too busy sobbing about maybe I'm internally transphobic or that there is no explanation. Maybe there is no explanation and I am internally transphobic. I just felt like if I can follow a societal way of allowing myself to exist that I don't have to feel pressured about me not feeling valid. Ultimately I fell back into 'What makes me valid?' if there is no answer then why do I exist? Now I'm in mental torment, what do I do? Like I'm legit lost. Nothing is appealing anymore and I just want to live my life.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

However, you cannot have dysphoria and not be transgender. If that makes any sense at all lol. I guess that I'm a woman (transwoman, read the username, hear me roar XD) of acceptance.

"Are there any philosophers that think maybe we don't need to explain everything?  That some things just are and it's better to just accept it than try to validate it?  Or I should say get other people to validate it?  I know we are all monkeys and so we need to get together in groups and all that.  But some of us are always just going ot be outside the norm and our species' ability to recognize what is different from what is dangerous seems pretty lacking.  Maybe a trans person with a beard is just a thing.  It's not dangerous to anyone.  And if it is a fad it will fade away on its own.  I never really get why Tiffany thinks people like Baltimore will hurt trans peopel in general..  Especially since those that would use Baltimore against Trans people don't' like trans people anyway, regardless of the reason, they say they are trans.  If anything Tiffany is more dangerous since she reinforces the idea that one has to be Normal and that means clicking off little boxes like a recipe until people who will never accept you accept you.  Also, why does transgenderism or anything need only a single cause?  Maybe there are multiple causes that just happen to have a shared outcome?  Maybe we should focus on differentiating what is dangerous from what is different and it is just different just.. not worry about it.  I don't know.  I am probably rambling.

But it all comes down to empathy, communication and sometimes believing in other testimonies.  Did that make sense? Idk. I was raised a man and I'm very probably transgender, and I needed to 'rationalise' everything that I felt. This blocked the many complexities of my emotions, because I needed a box.

So it`s nothing but a definition we ourselves construct. Then why not say, just for the fun of it, that gender is as follows: Gender depends on 2 factors. Factor 1. is your selfidentification, you are what you think you are. But factor 2. is the societal  reaction to your gender. That doesn`t mean that you aren`t a man until society accepts that, it just means that the 'Genderequillibrium' hasn`t been reached. Societal expectations can`t and never can observe your internal Selfidentification so it has to react to you`r performance. If your selfidentification and the societal reaction are in line, you reach Genderequillibrium. If not, both try to actively correct that imbalance.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'I pity you because you because you don't think you're real until a man in a lab coat signs a prescription pad... I can't imagine what thats like to have so little confidence in your own reality'   Years ago I was having doubts about my gender identity but then I got swept up in truscum logic, and it's had ever lasting effects. I'll have one day where I have a revelation that I'm trans and be filled with relief, then hours pass and I'm filled with doubt that I'm not trans enough. It's an emotional rollercoaster I just desperately want to get off. The past year I've been really struggling with it. I don't feel any label correctly describes my experience or my feelings. I so desperately just want an authority figure to just tell me what I am and what I should do so I can stop thinking about it. When Baltimore said this, I nearly burst into tears because I felt like they were talking directly to me. It's going to lead me to do a lot of introspection, and hopefully a road to being more confident in myself.

I do have dysphoria but only top (that I plan to remove), genital and social.  When I was younger I faced a LOT of backlash and still do, but it's whatever.  The idea that we HAVE to be stereotypical in order to be valid is bullshit. A delicate cis man that likes cute things and isn't 'manly' is still a man. And so am I.  The whole 'transtrender' thing to me is just a way to say: 'hey, I don't think I'm a real man/woman and want to feel better by invalidating others'. Complete bullshit.

"The camera angle technique is really interesting; notice how Tiffany is always facing at a slight angle away from the viewer when she's talking to Baltimore, but Baltimore is always facing directly at the camera, toward us, when speaking to Tiffany. It gives the impression that B. has a more direct line of communication to the viewer, like a kind of 4th wall teasing as a means of more effectively getting the message across. But because the conversation is still primarily between two fictional characters within the video, Tiffany still acts as a sort of proxy so the viewer can be more at ease when listening, they feel less 'talked at' and are thus more likely to remain less defensive, and more receptive, to the message Natalie is attempting to convey. Not sure if it's intentional but it's cool nonetheless.   Let us also take a moment to appreciate how happy Plato would be with this format, I'm sure he would be quite pleased to see it   lulz <3   Edit: Those Mucha posters are bomb","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thoroughly enjoyable as always. Though as a Native American, Kanienkeha'ka, the two-spirit thing.... Isn't accurate...... Two-spirit is more in line with other 'almost transgender but not at all' things in other Asiatic cultures.  Personally... I was around at the turn of the century when it became 'hip' to be gay. I can't tell you how often I was introduced as X's gay best friend for the other person to respond with 'Oh, you're gay? Well I'm bisexual, but I would never have sex with a same-sex person.' To which I was like.... 'Then you're not bi, stop coopting my sexuality to make yourself not milquetoast' in my head. And sure enough, *none* of those 'bisexuals' are anything but heteronormative heterosexuals today. Which damages the rest of us as it gives 'evidence' for how it's just a choice. (It's not.) So I worry when I see people claiming trans identity *while also claiming cisgender everything* (presentation, pronouns, etc) that history is repeating and these individuals are doing systemic harm by giving ammo to people who will try and claim transgender is a choice or a phase.  Though I would never confront someone over it. I just worry about the others they may be unintentionally, indirectly harming.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm only halfway through this video and I will be watching the whole thing, but I have to say that I still somewhat disagree with the message I've seen so far. The LGBT community gained equality by explaining to bigoted people that you do not choose to be gay, lesbian, etc. Trans/non-binary people with dysphoria are included in this because they do not choose to be trans, it's an inherent part of them that they were born with. It's difficult for me to associate so called 'trans-trenders' with the community when they do not have dysphoria, because this implies that they do not have the innate medical need to transition. I'm not asking this question to be disrespectful and people are welcome to explain this better to me, but if you are trans or identify as any other gender without having dysphoria, is it a choice?  Edit: Another point that I sometimes have an issue with is that some people tend to confuse gender identity with gender expression. For example, if a man wants to wear traditionally female things like dresses, makeup, have long hair, etc it doesn't necessarily make him any less of a man. These attributes of gender are socially constructed, so they inherently cannot define your identity. They define your style and expression. In our society, a trans woman would most likely want to wear dresses and makeup to 'pass' as a woman, but in an ideal setting, these style characteristics shouldn't be defining her identity. Imagine a society where traditional gender expression was swapped, i.e. men historically wore dresses and women traditionally buzzed their hair or something. A trans woman would still have the brain chemistry of a woman, but she would present entirely different in our society. I hope I haven't made this too confusing, but what I'm basically trying to say is that just because a person wants glitter in their beard, long hair, makeup, as dresses, it doesn't necessarily make them some sort of new gender, it just makes them unique in their expression.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I just recently read a manga called 'Our Dreams at Dusk' about a closeted gay kid who meets a group of other queer people and gets to know them and their stories. The biggest takeaway I got from that story was the theme of 'acceptance, not understanding.' I don't have much genderfuck going on ('cis by default' sums me up better than anything else) but I'm aroace. I'm tired of trying to figure out what 'counts' as attraction. I'm tired of trying to define undefinable words just to confirm that I don't experience what they describe. I just want people to be ok with where I'm at right now. I'm super aware that maybe I'm not 'really' ace and that maybe I'm just gay and super closeted or I'm straight and I'm super repressed. Who knows. I'm 100% on board with 'deal with it' as a theory for gender and sexuality.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm really happy you made this video. Not necessarily in some 'finally, the world needed this' way, just because i've been struggling with the concept of gender a lot lately. As a (as far as i can tell) cis girl who's learned about gender largely from your videos and various people on tumblr, the concept of identifying as a gender is still really blurry when it comes to the technicalities, and the discussion in the second part of this video really summed up the problem nicely. If we take gender to be entirely biological and based on chromosomes or the genitalia you're born with, like terfs insist, we end up completely invalidating trans people's experiences with gender dysphoria and identity as either confusion or lying, which isn't very accurate. If we take the transmed idea that gender is biological, but tied to your brain rather than your chromosomes, we end up invalidating the experiences of both trans and cis people whose brains don't match up with their identity. If we go with gender as a set of performative behaviours, we end up invalidating the experiences of gender nonconforming people, closeted trans people etc., which is why your earlier videos on the topic kept bothering me. I suppose Tabby's solution really is the one that makes the most sense for the time being and we should just respect people's identities, no matter how ridiculous or nonsensical they may seem to us, personally. I guess I don't really have anything meaningful to say on the matter, just that I'm grateful you addressed this issue directly, because otherwise i'd still be stuck in my own head wondering which option made the most sense.

"But the science is just not conclusive that men and women have inherently different brains.  'One of the authors, Daphna Joel, had previously published a study of structures and connections in over 1,400 brains from men and women aged between 13 and 85, in which no evidence was found of two distinct groups of brains that could be described as either typically male or typically female. Brains were more typically unique 'mosaics' of different features - something more correctly characterised as a single heterogeneous population.  Such a mosaic of features cannot be explained in purely biological terms; it is a measure of the effect of external factors. This is true even at the most fundamental level. For example, it can be shown that a 'characteristically male' density of dendritic spines or branches of a nerve cell can be changed to the 'female' form simply by the application of a mild external stress. Biological sex alone cannot explain brain differences; to do so requires an understanding of how, when and to what extent external events affect the structure of the brain.  The notion that our brains are plastic or malleable and, crucially, remain so throughout our lives is one of the key breakthroughs of the last 40 years in our understanding of the brain. Different short- and long-term experiences will change the brain's structure. It has also been shown that social attitudes and expectations such as stereotypes can change how your brain processes information. Supposedly brain-based differences in behavioural characteristics and cognitive skills change across time, place and culture due to the different external factors experienced, such as access to education, financial independence, even diet.'

"Thank you, thank you, thank you. All the time I get videos popping up by binary trans people going after the 'trenders' even though I continually tell YouTube to stop showing that shit to me. I feel like it's always shown that non-binary people deal with none of the self hate that the ultimate 100% valid binary trans do so we're nothing. In reality being well aware of the constant attacks on us makes me fucking hate this thing about myself. I hate saying I'm non-binary. And it's not because I'm afraid of cis people attacking me for being trans, it's because I'm afraid of other trans people pointing at me as a trender and being told I'm not actually who I am. I could honestly cry at this point because it feels like everything I see on here is people making fun of non-binary people and to see this pop up it's the first recommended video about non-binary people that didn't make me feel ashamed, and instead actually supported.

Takes forever to stop hating yourself because society thinks you don't even exist. Binary and non-binary trans people are both trans. No one is more trans than the other.

"I'm almost 9 minutes in, and first off I want to say: Yes, I think being trans is indeed a medical condition. I wouldn't call it a psychiatric condition because it's not like having a male or female brain is a medical condition, but it's certainly a medical one--misalignment of the brain with the rest of the body. There is some research that says that male and female brains have different proportions of white and grey matter, but it's still a very contentious topic in neuroscience, a field which we still know very little about (I hope the rest of the video has some insights from your history as a sort-of neuroscientist, I've been waiting to hear your take on that for _ages_ now...). Non-binary people, by this logic, have brains that are in an intermediate state--essentially being intersex but in the brain. Now, dysphoria can be very, very real, but it can stem from things other than brain misalignment--e.g. a form of depression or self-loathing or other kinds of psychiatric disorder, as evidenced by the experiences of people detransitioning. When Baltimore asked Tiffany if she'd gotten her brain scanned, it just made me think about how I've been thinking for years now that people really _should_ get their brain scanned, so that doctors can see whether it's an issue of brain misalignment, or just the manifestation of a different underlying issue that should be addressed differently; otherwise, patients could go through years of taking hormones, sterilizing themselves and damaging their kidneys (if they're taking oestrogen and spiro--not sure about the side effects of testosterone and whatever the male equivalent of spiro is), and spending loads of money on a series of painful surgeries with long recovery periods, and failing to resolve the _actual_ underlying issue that just stays there and fucks everything up again once more. (P.S.: Please, Natalie, I've been waiting for months for you to approve my Hebrew translations, there are a bunch of at risk teens I really want to show them to)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Contra, you really called me out at that part about Justine identifying as nb because she couldn't reconcile being a gay woman. Like, I'm cis, but I had a period of questioning my gender for a while because while I knew that people could be gay, because of my surrounding it hadn't quite settled in. In my community, being gay was something you were quiet about, but it wouldn't isolate you. I guess internally I figured being trans would be better because then the people who'd be ashamed of me would actually hate me enough to cut me off themselves, and I wouldn't have to do any of the bridge burning. So when I really, actually realized I liked girls, I identified as a trans guy, and when I realized that, oh no, I still also like boys, I went all in, guess I'm nb. And now that I'm more secure in how I feel and in a much better environment, I can just be a bi cis woman without my mind screaming at me that that's not ~really~ possible. I still feel somewhat bad about that phase, because I feel like I've given the people to whom I'd been open about my identity ammo in the whole 'transtrender' debate? This is turning into a rant but I just wanted to get my feelings out. Great video as always! All hail Queen of BreadTube!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i don't really like the way transmeds were portrayed in this video, because most of us aren't like this. most of us DO believe in non-binary people, but all we say is that you need to have dysphoria to be trans, otherwise, why are you transitioning? and plus, if you DO transition without dysphoria, it will give you dysphoria. that's why we have detransitioners. the reason im a transmed is because i don't want people to get dysphoria by transitioning without having it, because it's not fun. to be honest, i see trenders/tucutes as misinformed on what dysphoria is, or they're looking for attention for the wrong reasons. dysphoria is fluctuating and fluid. its not just stationary and its not just hating your body, its a disconnection from your biological sex, and that can cause mild to severe discomfort.

"When I first came out as trans, it was pretty traumatic for both me and my mom (birth is never easy, right?) and she said 'Couldn't you just be gay or pregnant?' because those were both things she had vocabulary and experience with and knew how to handle. Years later I came back and was like 'Well... I'm still not pregnant'. My mom has become super supportive after the rocky first start, she even pseudo adopts other adult trans people who's families have shunned or turned them out. But in her defense, literally neither of us knew what was going on and she did a whole bunch of research to help me even have a vocabulary for my problem after the first few months of us alternating between not talking and yell/crying at one another.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"When did sex and gender become the same thing to people though? There are two sexes, excluding intersex which is a biological combination of the two anyway, there are at least two genders, depending on how you look at them there could be 4?? But there is a dual plane spectrum across all 4, but choosing to have a word for each of these kinda makes that person an asshole, the human brain can only comprehend so much, but it can calculate and extrapolate very easily, if you give coordinates to the gender map like the political one, you can place yourself and others very quickly, you don't need to have a new word for everything, now if you look at the face that each of the other genders is based off the main two that are based off the sexes, then you could say there are two, but to say there are only two is intellectual dishonesty, and yes, agender and gender non conforming and non binary are all based on the two in that they are purposely not built upon them, the 4 I mentioned are man, woman, bi-gender and agender, there is a diamond type shape (the one that has 4 sides and 4 corners and resembles two triangles laid base to base) with man and woman at the long ends and binary duality and non binary at the corners in the middle, where someone is is based primarily on this, if you have reason to believe otherwise, tell me what your gender is, and what delegates it from the diagram, and what is your gender expression, sorry in advance if I say anything wrong, I have been insensitive in the past, I'm not a mind reader and not on everyone's page, I just try to mediate facts and feelings to a coherence that is acceptable to both parties","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Natalie,  I think you made a logical mistake here. You presume that gender can only be one of the three things, and that's one of the same logical traps that the right wing tries to use. There is nothing that says that gender, as we think of it, cannot have aspects of psychology, biology, and culture. Indeed, there's fairly indisputable evidence that both biology and culture play a role. As for biology, see David Reimer. Culturally, pink and blue (obviously) aren't intrinsically gendered.   Also, you sort of hand waved the role 'intrinsic characteristics' plays in the legal realm. It can mean the difference between legal protections, and the government being able to do whatever they hell the feel like on a whim.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"HOLY SHIT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR A VIDEO ABOUT THIS TOPIC FOREVER!!! I LOVE YOU,,,  Honestly, the whole dysphoria debate made me repress any question I had about my gender identity. I was afraid to experiment with my gender for fear that I'd be seen as a 'trender'. I read countless posts about what makes a trans person valid and what makes them invalid, and I internalized it all. I thought I was too comfortable to be trans, but, in reality, I'd been so uncomfortable throughout my life that it became the norm; it became my comfort. My discomfort is real, but it's not the cookie-cutter suffering that every 15 year old transmed on tumblr vents about. I didn't know what I was feeling was dysphoria, and, therefore, assumed that I didn't have dysphoria; I assumed I couldn't be trans. It wasn't until I stopped giving a fuck about whether or not I was a 'valid' trans person that I was FINALLY about to discover myself. I am proud to call myself a trans man, especially considering how much of my life I spent trying to fight that label.  Even if I didn't have dysphoria, I would still be trans. My pain does not define me, and to hear people scream that it is the most integral part of my identity is defeating.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
