"On Carlin a debate arises : cripple did not use to be a slur (and some would argue it barely is one today). Throughout language words used as euphemisms to describe people in a more neutral light, such as retard in the 19th century, continuously end up becoming slurs. Is it so that we must continuously push back and replace our words as if the initial problem, hate and disdain, are to go away ? By making more and more complexe euphemisms I feel that in some cases we are not just masking the previously mentionned problem, we are also sometimes dehumanizing those we are describing with said terms. Thats what Carlin wanted to point out in the sketch in my opinion.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It allows me to express my experiences when misogynistic people treat me as a woman because of my body less seriously (lessening dysphoria and anxiety talking about misogyny).

"I once attended a meeting of a club for trans and nb people at my university while I was still questioning, and I definitely get what Natalie is talking about when she says those spaces can be suffocating. I was still trying to figure shit out, but it didn't feel like I could ask any real questions or even make jokes. Saying 'stupid' or 'dumb' literally resulted in people yelling 'ableist language!' at me. The whole experience honestly put me off from exploring my gender identity for awhile. Several trans/nb friends of mine have also mentioned briefly attending meetings and feeling uncomfortable.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"A lot of comedians punch up and down because when people are young and uncivil they laugh at everything...So when a comedian does this it makes people feel young again.That's one reason why it is permitted in some people.A second stage of comedy is when the comedian says 'i can't laugh at this.' and then places himself and the audience in a situation where it is uncivil to laugh..that can be very funny..that's like adolescence where  correct social behavior is still being learned.A stage three comedian, who has developed past the first two stages uses his or her own struggles with life from personal experience as the basis for comedy and hopes the audience has had similar experiences.I think all three are permitted because because it is what everyone goes through and understanding all of it is good.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"19:35 George Carlin said he didn't consider 'cripple' to be a slur, and I don't think it's always been treated as such. Even so, he should have known better, because by the time of this bit it had been moved into the 'slur' category. Also, George got 'post-traumatic stress disorder' wrong: 'shell shock,' the term he preferred, is a subset of PTSD, and we there's no reason not to use both terms. PTSD is another term that's wordy but necessary due to its broad applicable. And when one uses the initialism (not acronym since it's not pronounced as a word!) 'PTSD,' it has a powerful, harsh sound to it, similar to 'shell shock.'  I still love you, though, George <3","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thank you for this video. I really related to your feelings of 'being a double agent in the debate about PC' and it helped explain to me why I like certain jokes with dark topics and why I dislike others.  I just wanted to add something about the topic of self-deprecation however. I agree with what you said, but I feel it is also important to talk about the dangers of using self-deprecation to deal with your feelings. There are many people out there who use self-deprecating humour to talk themselves down and remain in a very low state of self-confidence. Making jokes about your insecurities can be great if it makes you feel less bad about them, but sometimes it may make your feelings worse by saying out loud how you really feel about yourself. Ask yourself: Am I really joking right now? If so, great! If not, why do I feel this way about myself? Should I talk to someone about it?   Also side-note: I hope one day they will be able to use something like CRISPR to replace the DNA in random jizz or egg-cells with DNA from people who can't have kids. That would be dope!

You can certainly explain however that the reason they found something funny was due to a lack of understanding on their part however.   A question then comes up, should comedians have to give people lectures on each topic they talk about to ensure they laugh for the right reasons at the right things, or is catering to what the crowd most likely already thinks an okay approach. Obviously it doesn't have to be on or the other but I think practically speaking, unless you are a savant at secretly lecturing people, you'd have a very rough time doing the former, and that's why the latter happens so often.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"because all the black comedians in the 90's know what it's like to be white. like white people get free rule over everything they literally made a living off racist white men jokes. We are all born with perfect credit scores, and a key to the fucking city. I honestly thought this was satire, but it's clear you believe your shit. The irony of this logic attempting to have legitimacy by trying to use logical fallacies improperly. This issue is SJW bullshit is clearly ruining not only entertainment but the republic rule of law. and if you thing feminism, and LGBT rights have more importance than egalitarianism all you are is supporting a culture that will be self defeating. Think I am wrong want to talk about cleche's and tropes fine, go look at the pro SJW movement in 2019 it is an absolute dumpster fire. Why because your culture aims to invalidate someone because of what they are instead of who they are, the same exact logic we get from any bigoted group that supports discrimination. you want to be an equal learn to deal with the same bullshit we all have like an adult instead of forming fascist counter culture that is not in the best interest of freedom made to boycott america into a dystopia. Also let me be the first to say I work with and have backed the trans community. I have worked security and at a gay bar that has trans people as well. I know the culture they are some of my favorite people in the world. I love and respect them. I do however call the same bigoted attitude out when someone talks shit because a skinny twink isn't behind the bar and some cis gendered dude is, and yes it is discrimination. I serve a good drink, and give a good talk. it shouldn't matter what sex, race, sexual preference I am. It is SJW dogma that has formed a cult of division and hate it has done nothing but fan the flames of hate. chappelle came along when black jokes on white comedians had been done to death and still made it funny, because he dished the same shit out to everyone. A black man is not the only demographic who should have the right to do without a bunch of oversensitive children starting a picket line like the westboro baptist church. make no mistake it is real hard to see the difference in a 2019 SJW and an elderly devout christian lady.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Even tho my dad is part black and I don't look white, I would never use nigger in a derogatory way or refer bc I'm just not that type of person.  Sometimes people are just joking and sometimes they use 'it's just a joke' as a way to get outta trouble.

"This video reminds me of this story called 'The license', by Italian playwright Luigi Pirandello. An old man asks a bureaucrat to give him a 'jinx license'. The comedy in the first part is the fact that this old man is very obviously senile, there is no such thing as a jinx license, in fact there is no such concrete thing as bad luck, good luck, so he's asking to capitalize on old-fashioned superstition that doesn't exist anymore, come on. The dark twist, the humor as Pirandello called it, comes when it's discovered this man isn't senile at all. He has been stigmatized for no particular reason, people already see him as a jinx, he already suffers because of superstition that will never really die because we, as humans, are really dumb and believe illogical things even when confronted with the fact. Because of this, no one wants to hire him, so he thought he could instead capitalize on this very superstition, make everyone believe not only he truly is a jinx, but that you also have to pay him so the jinx falls on someone else: a rival in business, some guy who wants to steal your girlfriend, your mother-in-law, whoever. He wants to capitalize not only on the stigma he had to endure for years, but on the petty disdain humans feel for each other.   It's pretty much what Natalie does: takes all the stigma trans women, and herself, suffer, all the hatred and violence they receive, all the names they are called, and twists them into a joke at the expense of bigotry, and gets paid for it via Patreon. It's also the difference between comedians like Ricky Gervais and comedians like Natalie, the difference between Pirandello's comedy and Pirandello's humor: comedy is laughing at something that makes you laugh because of its superficial absurdity, like an old senile man asking for a jinx license, or saying you, a cis man, didn't change as much as Caitlyn Jenner did, while humor is laughing even harder at something while perfectly aware of the dark reasons behind it and realizing that they are even more absurd than a superficial look lets you believe, like an old perfectly sane man trying to make a living with the fear people have of him, or having the first moment of being recognized as a woman at a sperm bank while you're about to bust a nut.   And this is to another ramble on Italian literature that I make on YouTube comments because no video editing software works on my laptop.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I can laugh at jokes about females, blondes, house moms, etc. From men. They don't need to 'know about my experience' to have a pretty good idea. EVERY person has their struggles. The best solutions to make these things easier is comedy.  Trans people are such a small portion of the population.... And will be for a long time.. there's no way for all these comedians to 'understand'. Don't take it so personal, tootse. I was able to laugh with GIGI, even though I am not a part of the trans community, or, share your experiences! Edit: I enjoy your music, by the way. You have many talents.

"I think the bigger misconception by the edgelord/shitposter comedian type is mixing up 'truth' with 'a lot of people have had similar thoughts.' I think you addressed this in a much older video, and basically stated that you occasionally have some not very nice thoughts come into your mind in reaction to certain things, but that instead of verbalizing them or acting on them, you just accept that they're thoughts and move on. The 'risky, edgy, truth-tellers' aren't really speaking the truth, they're just verbalizing the things that have popped into a lot of our heads at one point or another. In some ways I think that can actually be a pretty effective and relatively benign form of comedy, but as you've already outlined much more beautifully than I ever could, this becomes a problem when these verbalizations are more cruel and offensive than funny.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I am a better person because of you, and no matter what happens, your legacy is so much more than the mouth feel (I'm really curious about that btw), it's all the sparks of truth, and humanity you have stirred in people.

Anyway, what he gets a kick out of even more than me getting huffy about racist jokes is when I use ablest slurs because I'm disabled. Now it's his turn to make the funny faces.   There was one time when we were in the air port and we kept getting special treatment because when asked for his ID my dad always shows his military ID. I mean, he doesn't ask or expect it but people or nice. But one time it was a little ambiguous if we were given special treatment because I was gimping my way slowly and uncoordinatedly around the airport or if it was because of his ID. So I turned to him and said, 'Did they let us take cuts because you're military or because I'm a cripple?'

I was talking to somebody who spouted the common trope that 'punching down is never funny,' and since 'men oppress women' only in this world, no joke by a man at the expense of women or a woman could be funny. Yeah, no. Sorry. If you can't understand that it's possible to both support gender equality and recognize a good joke on women (and a good joke on men) then you're simply denying reality. Humor is a truthful reaction. If you try to shut down funny people who don't 'follow the rules' then you'll be doing it through suppressed giggles and you'll look like the world's worst hypocrite.

I was the first trans person a shit ton of people ever met and whether I liked it or not, how they perceived me was bound to shape how they saw the transgender community.

"I definitely agree comedy needs a much greater philosophical consideration than it is getting and has received... as a shitty open mic'er I don't agree (i don't disagree either). Lacking from your meditation is what it takes to confront 'the darkness'. Pryor should be a role model for his blatant honesty but for many people that self honesty is difficult to achieve.   Also self deprication should be the comic's way to state they are alive despite the darkness. It's itself an art of putting yourself down not as a paradigm but rather as an invitation to the audience to look inward and outward at their darkness. Even in my consideration do I ask is this The Art of comedy...  Finally part of comedy is the comedian's persona. If over the top and offensive is their frame then that is the jokes they will tell. Problem is edgy is difficult to maintain. If Pryor told his freebasing anecdote over and over to roughly the same crowd, it would stop being funny, edgy, and honest. In a way the persona is just as limiting as the nature of edginess.   I'm not a fan of the politicizing comedy notion but it's worth pointing out that when you flatten Gervais' or any comic's joke you lose a key aspect that made the comic the comic this is also my defense of why comedy should be understood as a visceral experience  (i.e. inciting emotions in the audience)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"First of all: Great video, this is an idea that I genuinely hadn't encountered before (Would anyone know if there is more on this? My mind is kinda ringing with comedians expressing something along the lines, but never in such a definitive way)   Second: Nobody has done a 'I Believe in a Thing Called Love' joke yet, really?   Third: I have questions on terminology, because I feel lost. Natalie said 'first you live as one gender, then the other.' - so far, so good, gender as a denomination for a social role, makes sense.    But a bit later comes a part where she said 'You're not changing your sex at all.' - You're not? I thought 'sex' was the biological part and there's a transition there, right? I'm not trying to be offensive here, I'm just literally that ignorant.   And then she said 'Biological name'. First, I find that term endlessly fascinating, but second: Am I right to assume that 'biological' in this case is used to point towards your mental makeup? And the biology behind that? Like, Natalie would be biologically female, since her synapses tell her she's female (much like mine tell me I'm male)? Or is it because of her hormones, so she's now awash in female hormones thus rendering her biologically female? Or is it something else entirely?   I'm asking because I had come to appreciate the difference between sex and gender - sex being a biological construct, gender being a far wider concept, psychologically and socially for instance. But here, both 'biological' and 'sex' are being used to denote her as female. I could think of a reason (hormones) for the latter, but I'm lost on the former. Could somebody help me out here? Is there yet another word for the gender, she had before transitioning?   And on another note entirely: Isn't making sense of a world you don't understand anymore and commenting on your coming to grips with new concepts and terms also a valid form of comedy? I'm sincerely asking. I incidentally saw that bit by Ricky Gervais and also  found it lacking (as even I with my immensely limited understanding of the trans experience saw certain gaps in his knowledge), but if people also confused about the emerging openness about being trans find it funny - then isn't it that? You could argue for a comic's influential position and thus need to enlighten here, but I feel that would go against the parameters set up in the discussion. By which the comic's joke is only judged against how much it reflects their inner emotions (i.e. Ricky's confusion and anger on being limited in expressing things he feels represent the truth) and how funny it is. For instance: If I joke about depression, which does come from within me, then my perspective is also limited, right? A clinical psychologist has, somewhat ironically, a more enlightenend look on my pain. Are only their jokes funny, because they come from a more educated place? Even if people equally uneducated but coming to grips with depression found it relatable? I certainly understand that Natalie doesn't want to impede Ricky Gervais' comedy in any way (She says as much), but she does judge it not to be funny, because it isn't saying anything about the trans experience. But what if it isn't meant as a joke for trans people, but rather people being equally confused (and to a degree maybe frightened and angry)? Again, a point could be made for punching up, down and all rest of the Konami code directions, but isn't that an argument about the appropriateness of a joke (which we have taken out of the equation)? So, in essence: Can Ricky Gervais' jokes (as uninformed as they might be) not be considered funny by exactly the people with the same level of misinformation? It speaks to their experience as much as Gigi Gorgeous' jokes speak to Natalie, which I can appreciate, but it doesn't make me laugh. Neither does Ricky Gervais. Maria Bamford does (and the reason behind that should be obvious). Can anyone... be bothered to read this? And if yes, can anyone maybe hand me the tool to untangle this knot in my head, 'cause I'm lost here.   TL;DR: Very good video, but I have things that need to be explained to me.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The entire point of comedy, I think, is to cast subjects that we'd normally like to avoid in a light-hearted manner. It is the 'great neutralizer' of emotion neither inherently good nor bad, an emotion that can be provoked either by children running around a playground or Joker bashing Jason Todd with a crowbar.   I liked the realization in 'Stranger in a Strange Land' -- ''I've found out why people laugh. They laugh because it hurts so much . . . because it's the only thing that'll make it stop hurting.''  Although perhaps this doesn't explain the 'children playing' laughter...but perhaps it makes being chased in tag or being tickled (your ticklish areas are your vital areas for predators after all) less scary. Perhaps I should use the word 'perhaps' one more time in this sentence.   I was going somewhere with this....oh ya! The tight rope analogy and how to walk it. Well, as a shit poster leftist groups and a moralist everywhere else this point would probably be a lot like the blind leading the blind but here we go: I think the purpose of comedy should shock the audience into paying attention to something that wasn't getting put under a proper critical light before.   [Trigger Warning -- Rape]  Which is why Daniel Tosh's 'wouldn't it be funny if she got raped?' while did provoke laughter (admittedly in me as well--it was funny because it was wrong..per the Stranger in the Strange land definition) but it  was 'bad comedy' but Sarah Silverman's joke 'It's not even that risky to make a rape joke, like who's going to say anything? Victims usually don't even report the rape' is comedy gold.  Because it makes people think like 'holy shit that's true and terrible, we should think about that more'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I feel like Bo Burnham's comedy could kind of fit into this. Like sure there's some edgier jokes that don't always land in his specials but for the most part I feel like he's pretty self aware of that and you can see his growth from his earliest edgy humor into more introspective pieces like We Think We Know You from 'what.' Even some of the edgier jokes from that special are delivered in a more mature manner in his follow-up special Make Happy. When I've watched interviews he's also talked about how his humor was kind of shaped on the humorlessness of his upbringing (i mean, for fucks sake his mom works in hospice care how much more grim could you get) and his approach to humor just has always seemed really genuine to me. His humor is imperfect but it's honest in its imperfections.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Usually when I hear someone 'joke' like that, my only thoughts are: 'Come up with some new, I dunno know, maybe even enlightened, material already! Clearly you don't know shit about trans ppl...' And to me it is also offending because I know a lot of trans and queer people (I myself am bi, my sister is trans, most of my friends are either queer or trans, or they're cis ppl who are actually normal about this <3 ), and - unlike most retarded cis ppl who make fun of trans and queer ppl - they are the  kindest humans I know and deserve understanding and respect just as much as any other humanbeing!

"BTW: Not sure if your singing here is for comic effect. This is second time or so that you've complained about your 'feminine' singing voice. Are you aware that some women sing tenor?  Mary Travers of Peter, Paul & Mary sang tenor.  At 5'10' she was also a big girl!  (I love tall women since it's I too am a tall woman! I am  about 5' 11 & 3/4'.) Odetta, sometimes called, 'The Voice of the Civil Rights Movement' sang alto to baritone. I sang second tenor in high school choir. My voice can cover deep bass to tenor & sometimes alto. I can sing most any song Mary Travers sang, full voice, in the same key & octave, she did. I can also sing almost any song Odetta sang, full voice, in the same key & octave she sang it! Just saying, if you pick your female vocalists carefully, you may find there are female songs you can sing, full voice, 'en femme.'  Since 'Sound of Silence' was sung by two males, I am guessing your singing voice here is for comic effect(?).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Re: the George Carlin 'euphemisms are bad' bit -- Yep, he chooses bad examples.  In several cases, the newer words are better. First, as you point out, because of accuracy.  (Who was it that said, The beginning of wisdom is to call things by their proper name? Just Kungfucious, that's who.)  PTSD is more specific than 'shell shock'.   'Low income neighborhood' is different from 'high crime' or 'non-white' altho all can be implied by 'slums' or 'ghetto'. So there's the accuracy thing. And second, George thinks that scaring people makes them more sympathetic....  Really? I see the opposite. People back away from scary stuff. Their interest levels drop. Compassion goes limp. If I say, Friends, please come to my show, but find safe parking, because the venue is in THE GHETTO, then fewer ppl will come (from suburbia anyway) than if I simply warn about break-ins and say Here's the parking garage. Likewise, if you ask a mommy-of-2 if she minds being seated next to a man with PTSD, she'll brace herself and say, 'Okay, no problem, it's the least I can do, I Support the Chrupes.'  But if you ask her to sit next to A MAN WITH SHELL SHOCK, she's more likely to imagine drool, urine, groping, angry self-talk, and she'll say, 'No thank you. I'm a mother of 2. I have to think about safeguarding our future.'  And who can blame her? Don't judge mommy-of-2.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"The balance in comedy between moralism and shitposting reminds me of how I feel about horror movies:  The way I see horror movies, there is a balance between, for lack of better terms, darkness and light.  Darkness being the discomfort, unease, deep unsettling feelings for which we _go_ to horror movies, and light being the satisfaction, the joy, the comfort for which we go to, well, _movies._  If you go too far on the light side, you just don't have a horror movie anymore, you have an action movie or even a comedy.  Maybe it was scary for a moment, but good guys win, everyone lives who wasn't pure evil, and we were never really pushed out of our comfort zone.  This can happen also when horror movies rely too much on extremely cliche tropes, because even with gore and jumpscares, if your audience knows these beats and knows when to expect them because they've seen this formula 1,000 times since the mid 70's, then they're _not_ uncomfortable, and they're _not_ horrified.  It is possible, though, to go too far on the dark side, as well, in my opinion.  A perfect example of this for me was 'Hereditary'.  I found it _extremely_ unsettling, psychologically twisted, and uncomfortable.  Good job, I guess, but overall, it was just an unpleasant experience.  It ended with no feeling of satisfaction, no feeling that I had done anything worthwhile with my time.  'Sicario' and 'Zero Dark Thirty' are other examples.  They were not exactly 'horror' movies, but similarly left me with a feeling of deep dissatisfaction.  The horror of the conflict had not purchased any victory.  In the end, everyone is either evil, dead, or impotent, I'm rooting for no one, and the whole thing feels like a sad waste of time and energy.  I was _horrified,_ but not _entertained._ There are enough _real world_ horror stories if I want to just feel sick to my stomach.  Personally, I really like the balance that Jordan Peele has struck with 'Get Out' and 'Us'.  There is lingering horror _AND_ satisfaction.  Adventure _AND_ discomfort.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The point is you can critique a joke you don't find funny without demeaning someone ( I.e if you find ricky's jokes funny then you're just transphobic)  and actually try to ban these people. Ricky and his jokes may not be funny to you but to others they may be.  Humor is subjective and sometimes the surface level Joel's are the funniest i.e fart jokes or people talking down.  dont pretend other people are evil for finding jokes funny just because they aren't trans themselves. I find it funny cuz I know what the joke is about and how another person might think. Simple. I also find the trans person's joke funny as well but also due to the fact that I can relate if it was me. Doesn't have much to do with being trans or not.   Someone can relate to both.   In other words jokes are subjective and those that appeal to more people tend to be better but that doesn't mean others aren't funny ( like Ricky's jokes)  which most people who bitched at him didn't explain and just said '  im offended'   you assume waay to much about his jokes and his audience and that is where I split ways with your ideology. 'Well if they find it funny then they must all be bigoted' etc.  Is unfounded.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"How do you feel about Ricky's old Beaver joke? In my mind it's close in essence to the Bruce Jenner joke. I find them both objectively funny, a wordplay and a stereotype. Yes, he is not a lesbian or a trans person and he still dare's to go there...  The part about scraping semen from a wall... That's just your regular afternoon if you are a man. I can see it has a significance for a trans woman but for me... nah, was that really the pun? The most important part of Ricky's overall message is that you can joke about anything If you mean it well. I am sure there isn't a bad intent in his jokes. Celebrities can take it and there is a difference in joking about stereotypical woman driver and believing all women are bad drivers. Does he excel in telling jokes from the perspective of a fat old bloke, sure.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Yes, it is true, Ricky Gervais is a bit hit and miss. The hitting or the missing depends upon who you are, what you know already, what you have heard a hundred times...or never. Comedy (life itself?) is a diminishing returns kind of deal. Laughter diminishes ( diminishes or evolves?) into a sober nod of assent to a thought well formed. Laughter is a transformation of fear into the shock of recognition and relief. Ricky had a prolonged missing phase when he was trying to reclaim use of the word 'mong'. More miss than hit. A hit would be like reclaiming 'queer'. So, Gervais took a bit of a kicking on the 'mong' thing. The 'kicking' was not so much a matter of angry strangers with active fists. More a matter of soberly reflecting on what it would be to try to explain the joke to a child with Down's syndrome. Oooh. Ouch. Conscience see? That inner voice is rough as fxxx for Ricky, for me, for you. So on the back of that he started to get interested in the subject of Kindness. A range of mugs and Tee shirts with the slogan 'kindness is magic'. Kindness .....( REAL kindness see, not self serving B.S.)..is indeed some deep, heavy, transformative stuff. 'Tough Love' is a discredited phrase trying to express the same idea. It is indeed very very very difficult to distinguish kindness from bullying. Do you drink too much? Are you too fat? Should you change your life? Should you laugh or cry or both? Was that a mistake? Dark questions indeed. Light is on the other side of a resolution to those questions. Peace.

I don't want to spoil it, but he very much looked inside and back at his own past and made jokes about the darkness there. He made comedy out of the suffering of himself or his family and friends, not other groups of people. And he topped it all off afterwards by saying that after making those routines, he got a bit stuck, because as a straight white dude he basically hadn't suffered enough to make enough jokes about it, so (like all straight white dudes) he has to 'invent problems' in order to continue being funny.

And also he can't joke about rasist, animals, Christians... you get it - anything he is not. That might be great in your eyes, but that would also mean you can't joke or talk seriously about any topic you are not...

"In section 7 'The Eternal Tension' I am reminded of Lewis Black's philosophy about comedy. He has simply distilled it down to, 'Tension. Release.' I'm thinking maybe this is why this dark humor can be such fertile ground for comedy. It is a place of inherent tension, or as you put it 'eternal.' The comedy comes in finding the ways in which that tension can be released, perhaps not completely but in at least part for a short moment.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"On the point about the term 'sex change' being wrong, as much as I agree w/ the fact you can't change your biological sex (bc thats undeniably true rn), I disagree that it's an 'incorrect' term.  On a societal level, the term 'sex' mostly describes the characteristics of sex we see day to day; breasts, penises, vaginas etc... basically its most primary & secondary sex characteristics, characteristics that Gender Confirmation Surgery changes to fit into the other binary 'sex'. As on the societal level, sex doesn't describe the unchangeable (chromosomes), but the changeable, it makes sense to call Gender Confirmation Surgery a 'sex change', w/ the added bonus of making clear the difference between sex & gender, for those still confused on the subject (anecdotal evidence, but while explaining the difference, I've had people ask, if sex & gender are different, then why did progressive campaign to get it retitled to Gender Confirmation Surgery, it seemed to add to their confusion). I will mention that this viewpoint is of a person who never undergone any kind of hormone therapy or Gender Confirmation Surgery, & who despite being agender, uses he/him pronouns & 'presents' as male, so doesn't face the normal shit people w/ non-binary identities face, so its possible I'm missing something. If I'm wrong or bigoted in any way, please tell me, this is just my take, but I'm obviously willing to change my mind if I discover that I'm wrong ","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hi, I just found your channel and I am already obsessed with you. Your videos are so well thought out and I love the set designs and performances as different characters. Recently in my country,  New Zealand a mass shooting has happened. This is unusual for us as it just does not happen here with regularity, I don't think it's happened for centuries. Anyway, we now have a ban on semi automatic weapons in NZ. I've seen a lot of Americans online calling our country a dictatorship as a result (not true, the majority of us are behind Jacinda on this issue 100%. ) They seem obsessed with gun ownership in a way I find quite bizzare. I get that it's something to do with the second amendment, but I'd like to know your view on gun ownership in your country. So I'd like to suggest an episode about US gun ownership and whether gun laws in your country should be changed, the way we changed ours? Just an idea. It would definitely help illuminate to the rest of the world why some Americans are so rabid about gun ownership.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"speaking as a cis white male who has read infinite jest, i would like to discourse interminable on the nature of humor. i will try to restrain myself. ahm. some of the most honest things a lot of people ever say are couched as jokes. also, a lot of jokes mean nothing at all; they are mere absurdity, it could be said. this ambiguity is essential to the art of comedy. i also think it kinda implies some metaphysical shit, but let's not delve into that, yet. humanly speaking, the best laugh is that laugh which sheepishly slips out after one has narrowly avoided death, particularly stupid death that would be entirely the fault of ones own glorious recklessness. i have had the opportunity to laugh this laugh on a few occasions. it is speculated that this may be the biological origin of laughter. it is the most extreme comparison that can be drawn in life, and it really illustrates quite well the absurdity of this whole life business anyway. i trust you are aware of the story of the aesthetic young man who in a dream found himself in hall of the gods, and mercury offers the young man his pick of any of the finest things from the Olympus's treasure chest and in reply the young man says, 'I always want to have the laughs on my side,' ...and the gods just laugh. this is what i think humor is: awareness of the distance between actuality and ideality, and the absurdity of that. you clearly recognize this in regard to Ricky jarvase (not worth a spelling google) 's thing w offense. that's what makes the honesty of comedy so special: even moreso than most forms of communication, comics are often unaware of exactly what truth they are telling. sounds like nonsense, kinda, particularly to all these dweeby rationalist types how associate truth w science method and verifiability. but i believe that's how it is, i believe the logos is truth, and that's good enough for me. ladada, wrapping up.. speaking as a cis white male who likes to dress up like a youth pastor and pretend he has read Calvin, human beings are generally pretty shitty, and that's why i find leftist uproar about the latest offense pretty funny most of the time. they can't handle the truth; that is to say, they have an epistemology of, 'i'm right and you're wrong.' and that's so funny to me. i just wanna say, in the face of the absolute we're all wrong, honey. but that won't do any good... they just wanna hear themselves speak. sounds like someone else i know and self-loath. an ironic disposition has its shortfalls, one's own psychology state being far from the last of them, but it does keep one from being swept up into the fray of indignation, and i really think that's what our democracy needs right now. uhhh, yeah.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"hehe, hoenstly I don't think Ricky Gervais was the best example, I watched that special and he tells a series of jokes about various topics which are very on the nose, tried but prejudiced (bestseller?). But that's just the opening act, and each of these is revisited and elaborated upon, and everyone in the audience realises they laughed at all these basic-bigot jokes. It shows why Ricky Gervais shouldn't tweet or present award shows because his talent is in long form story humour, and Poe's law becomes inapplicable after the third act.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The darkness will eventually, inevitably destroy you. Deprive you, of reaching your fullest potential, if you remain there and don't run to the light. You'll end up in the abyss, here:    URL   That's not a good place to be. You'll be under the control of demonic forces, for an indefinite period of time. Perhaps forever. There are forces in this world, that want to degrade, defile and destroy us. They pervert our minds, our bodies, until we die both spiritually and physically. The abyss, that's where those who entertain darkness go. You enter the darkness to see the light, not to remain there. Our life here is but a test and we're suppose to ascend, if we want to live and commune with the source of our life.   Languishing in the decadence, immersing yourself and settling for darkness, produces a loss of energy. Loss of energy = death. Annihilation. Is that what you want?

The Gervais rant about transchimpness was lazy and predictable.

On the other I think the chance is so little that over a long enough time period, it may achieve the opposite by giving these ideas more visibility in the YouTube algorithm through interaction.

"I think it's mostly that gallows humour is only gallows humour if you're the one on the gallows. If you're in the crowd, it's just part of the execution. When Ricky G. makes a joke about trans people it's mocking, when a trans person makes a dark joke about their own trans experience, it's coping.

"I think the gender and disabled jokes were funny in that they were using a mock of the absurdity in the implementation of dogma around language around the significance of naming  that juxtaposes a prescriptive intensity to a definition that arose from descriptivism. They find naming itself absurd and want to mock the most powerfully emotional types to hit the hardest.  I don't find it funny because I think that naming is important as it expresses the truth was of subjective experience to humans. I subconsciously don't recognize the contradiction they do and don't feel the absurdity they do. This is why I feel negative towards it. I see the negative consequences to people when these things are recognized and think society should make an effort (should, not a mandate) to help each other feel their feelings are real. I'm frustrated because this understanding is ignored and rejected which I see as immoral and thus bad.

"Dear N. W., since some of the illustrious organisms composing your fanbase have been eager to ban me on Reddit when I have pointed out that Muslim =/= race (therefore making the Christchurch attack - at least apparently - a religion-driven hate crime and not a race-driven one), so they could pat each other's back in an appropriately revolutionwave atmosphere and shake their own mod hands for 'pointing out fallacies', I am going to add a few wee tiny considerations here. First of all, sorry, but waves and meta aside, your fanbase seems to have a sturdy xboner for biases. That is probably why they were so eager to give my buttcrack the boot without much of a thought. Maybe these biases are unavoidable given their experiences and scars in the trenches of the WWW, the result is still less than impressive. Second, 'we all fucking knew' what? Does an elementary understanding of the fact that humans are volatile and dangerous from n+1 standpoints make one some kind of golden speaker box? Who knows how many pedophiles and latent hurters of all sorts walk the face of this earth - how many plagued minds fail or avoid becoming their awful selves, whether they are exposed to other awful selves or not? I am definitely disgruntled at the sight of plainly bad jokes at the expense of people dying without any kind of (known) fault or guilt, but the smugly expressed 'pain' of leftists is every bit as repugnant as a Deus Vult yelled by moronic trolls. When ISIS gets to retaliate, what meaning will any 'we fockin knew' gain? That idiot with a camera gave a welcome pretext for retaliation to people who don't cringe at the sight of massive amounts of other people's blood anyway. Christians in Egypt don't die on camera, they are just anonymous rats that won't be of any interest to the enlightened ones. And I could bet my nuts that there will be at least one sad soul willing to consider me some right-buffalo-winger and a whataboutist for saying this. I am continuously failing to understand what your little monstaz are trying to gain with their 'we knew's. I am content to consider them a hot-blooded, yet sterile agglomeration of winged stylish paysans that are going to die every bit as lonely and useless as many other people of all shades and camps, after their abstract ambitions will have vanished from their abnormally bloated windpipes.

"I'm new to this channel. Not going to lie. When I saw 'Darkness' I the title. I was thinking this was going to be a critique on the cultural perception of Nihilism. Like what WiseCrack typically critiques Bo Jack Horseman, Rick and Morty, and season 1 of True Detective.   Like a critique on the critique or how any misconceptions of Nilihism in modern media is wrong or right ect.  And how this might be doing more harm than good for a depressed person.  Instead, I watched an analysis of trans jokes and how like all comedy needs to be based on facts instead of assumption. Those joke based on assumption does not cause damage through insults and hurting people's feelings. Instead it causes damage by confirming bigoted sentiments. Which historically has, especially in times of political and economic turmoil, not ended well for the people for the discriminated. Like the Holocaust or any beilf rooted in scientific raceism. Really any Us vs Them mentality.   This leads to a disscussion why does 'anti-Snowflake culture' exist? On what assumptions and misunderstandings is it based on?  What about my own perception on these groups?   Any way, I like the subverting tactic of your titles and I like how your videos make me question my own perception.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"the original deadnaming 'i haven't changed as much as bruce jenner' isn't even that bad. Because there once existed a man named bruce jenner, now that has changed. its a big change. I am against deadnaming when actually referring to people, but referring to the past is difficult. If you talk about what someone has done in the past, don't use the deadname obviously (although some circumstances might need to be clarified). But if you talk about an event that is related to the deadname, then the deadname is relevant. Talking about caitlyn jenner transitioning to caitlyn jenner is ... weird?

"Not really related to topic at hand but this is an observation that I NEED feedback on.  I often listen to LeftTube (Peter, Contrapoints, PhilosophyTube, HBomberGuy, so on) while I'm at work and I've been having an odd reaction. I work in a machine shop and I spend a lot of time delivering/picking up machinery from mine sites. As i listen to LeftTubers while doing my labors my mind always goes back to George Orwell's 'Road to Wigan Pier', specifically the portion of the book where he takes the academic 'bourgeois  bolsheviks' to task for harboring contempt for the people they appoint themselves to fight for.  It is bizarre but even as my logical mind agrees with them on the substance there is something in the aesthetic that infuriates me. As I'm standing outside a locked warehouse in 15 degree windy Wyoming weather, my clothes covered in mud, waiting for my site contact to meet me, there's something about Peter's presentation that makes me want to punch his smug stupid face. After I've been called back to the shop after being en route for damn near two hours I catch myself looking for any reason to disagree with Olly, even if it's something we fundamentally agree on. When I get called a 'f-----' for not going along with their transphobic jokes Natalie's words all sound like, 'you're not doing enough to check your privilege'.  What phenomenon is at work here? I ask because I think this gets to the core of why the left struggles to connect with the class we are fighting for.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Ok I've got a genderfluid story that's only slightly funny but still better than the over used trans jokes.   So a few months back I was working as a receptionist in a pretty conservative office, so I dress as a girl and avoid that demonic apparition that was my reflection when I was a man. Cringey sad music was involved.   Well one day I can't take it anymore, I had been a man for almost a week and if I had to wear a dress one more second I was going to scream. I raced home after work, parked my car in the wrong yard in my rush, said hi to the weird old man sweeping his sidewalk and ran as fast as a one can in too small heels to change. I have never put a binder on so quickly in my life.  While I'm changing, the aforementioned old decides to confront me about my parking. By the time he makes it to my door I've gone from full makeup, cocktail dress, stockings and heels to barefaced, dress shirt, slacks and oxfords. When I open the door he starts in with 'Now look here little lady-' at which point his 5'2 self looks up at my 6' self, sees how I look and shuts up.   I told him I was sorry to rush him off my porch but I was running late for a dinner date with my man and left. He washed my car for me the next day.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I agree that the chimp part at the end of the Ricky Gervais bit was basically a re-hash of a dead meme (which, in his the context of the bit, was basically transphobic), but the rest of the bit preceding it is genuinely funny imo. The part with Jenner visiting the doctors with Gervais constantly pausing the story to remind the audience that this was 'years ago' and 'that was his name at the time' like he's really trying to avoid offending people, only to follow up by ridiculously exaggerating Jenner's masculinity, as if the constant, nervous disclaimers mean it can't possibly be offensive. I think its brilliant!  I might just be Gervais stanning here tho. As cringe-worthy as his takes are on ''offending people', The Office UK and Extras are 2 of my all time favourite shows and he is absolutely perfect in both (might've just been Merchants magic tho as Derek is terrible imo).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It seems that white supremism has now infected not just the US and Europe, it's now in the Pacific. New Zealand has just had a mass shooting that targeted multiple mosques, during Friday prayers. The video was live streamed on Facebook, one of the guys behind it has a manifesto. I hope the New Zealand news doesn't even say his name, he isn't worth it, or the other terrorists who likely worked with him. It's assumed at least two people planned it. This also happened on the day high school students were protesting climate change, so those who protested in Christchurch are hiding. The fact white supremacy is now one of my country's problems- is just disgusting. People from smaller countries don't think it'll happen near them, that their countries are somehow better.

"Here's what I think: Comedy is funny because it subverts expectations. That's why slaughtering sacred cows are so funny to us. 'Can they do that? Are they allowed to say that!?'. Watch any comedy skit/movie/special, and notice that we find the absurd and unexpected hilarious. I think that's probably why humor is subjective: Each of us has different expectations.  Perhaps that could also explain why cis and trans people see transition-humor differently. Cis people have never gone through transitioning, and from our POV, we simply see another group of people ripe for the mocking. The ins-and-outs (Or if post-op, outs-and-ins) are going to be lost on those who lack the necessary experience to have expectations to subject.  You are right that Ricky knows nothing of your darkness, but I think his jokes highlighted a different type of darkness in society. He spent weeks in a controversial spotlight for doing what he's always done, and probably found the experience somewhat shocking. Rather than delve into the specifics of trans-people, it seemed to me that he was highlighting the absurdity of the event by simply going further down that offensive rabbit hole. If he'd been similarly criticized for a Jew joke, he'd probably have come out on stage wearing a Yarmulke and holding some money bags while talking about running the world and destroying Western civilization. It's not that he thinks that's how Jews *actually* behave (in much the same way he's probably aware the statements he's making about being a pre-op chimp aren't accurate), but is instead digging the hole deeper in order to cultivate more of the darkness that he's seen.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"About the 'I identify as an attack helicopter' meme. I think it does have some pertinence. I would say that the people it really mocks are NOT the real transgender and LGBT+ people, who are absolutely not delusional and usually identify just as understandable genders. IMHO, it mocks the people who want to be part of the LGBT+ as part of a trend, without really meaning it, because these people usually totally overdo it to legitimize their 'trendy identity' and will invent a million stupid unrealistic identities. I'm not saying these identities are not true, there must be people who really deep down are 'attack helicopters' or other more realistic rare identities, and I totally accept that, but most of the people who claim to be such ridiculously rare identities usually are just jerks who want attention.  TL;DR : IMHO this meme is not aimed at real LGBT, but at trendy jerks who like to pretend to be LGBT.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This reminds me of the trilogy of books by an FTM author, who delves into the safe space, 'politically correct' mindset. It doesn't really balance between self-deprecating humor and actual positive, uplifting messages that would inspire allies to support trans people! Fight with their fellow brothers and sisters! Being trans is good and pure! It just dives straight into the darkest mindset of a man struggling with dysphoria and navigating between the harsh blows dealt from the world outside and the sterile environment of trans support groups that don't want to admit that being trans is hard and emotionally taxing, and, really, not a great thing.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't trans ( or anyone who is for that matter), because the stuff is straight up an actual depression and dysphoria trigger. But it's also cathartic in that it actually talks about the 'darkness within'. It's a comfort to know you're not alone in your misery on that particular topic and to be able to laugh at it along with the narrator.  The book is 'Refuse' by Elliott DeLine, should anyone who sees this have their interest piqued.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'd like to hear you out on comedy, racism, slurs, offensive humour, and freedom of expression. I have strong feelings about it, and have nearly lost friends for standing by my decision to say the word 'nigger' instead of 'n-word' when I'm referring to the word directly. This applies to other slurs as well, but this is the only one giving me trouble (I am very white). I'm aware that Louis C.K. probably isn't your favourite comic, but he does make a good point in this regard. The problem for me is that most other people arguing about this are actual bigots, whose argument is 'if blacks [sic] can say it, why can't I?' Meanwhile, my main point is: If overtly racist people say it anyway (while low-key racists actually find some solace in ''''the n-word'''', why can't non-racists accept it as a part of our collective history instead of having to sidestep it? If anything, I think it should be mandatory to use the actual word(s) when referring to it. Pretending it doesn't exist or avoiding it because 'it makes other people uncomfortable' - while you're the one who's uncomfortable saying it, and need to understand why it makes you feel so despicable - only hinders dialogue and pushes people back into their separate corners (especially in the US, where I'm not from). Oof. Didn't mean to write such a long comment, and I probably didn't make my point as well as I wanted to, but you get the gist of it. It's an extremely sensitive subject and it seems that we could all benefit from having someone of your well-established intellect, culture, and sense of social fairness weigh in and shed some light on the issue.

"It's interesting to compare Ricky Gervais to other 'edgy, offensive' stuff like Always Sunny and South Park. The characters in those shows are unlikeable and cross the line because they are bad people. The shows miss the mark sometimes but are self-aware enough to revisit and self-criticise. I mean South Park did that 'I'm a Dolphin' episode (in 2005 GERVAIS) and have done other transgender stuff since then that shows some (limited) development and reflection on that original episode which was way off base.  Gervais's stuff tends to just contrive a situation where he (his character sorry) acts like a dick but it's ok because he (his charactrer I mean) is actually really special, clever and complex... the sub-text is basically just the text.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

By the way, Gervais joke did suck and for me people forcing to laugh at that shit is just a reaction to PC authoritarianism obviously.

"Natalie, the way you love raising your voice in song so much and your courage in sharing it even though you are clearly very shy about it touches me deeply. Thank you for singing the song. In my life I have had 8 different voice teachers and only 2 of them were worth a thing. But I am eternally grateful for the 2 who actually knew something to teach. I hope you have opportunities in your life to learn how to gain confidence and enjoyment in using your voice. What you said, however, about singing like a boy just isn't, can't possibly be, true. The range of a contralto completely overlaps the range of a tenor. The range of a countertenor completely overlaps the range of a soprano. There really isn't boy versus girl in singing. Those who aren't born knowing it have to learn how to unify the chest voice, the mid-range and the head voice, eliminating breaks, and that is something that can be taught. But once you can play your own voice as a single instrument from your lowest note to your highest, then that voice is yours and you are that voice. You are your own instrument to play as well as you are able, whatever your range.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Good video. You argumented well enough for the problems and stupidity of Gervais going for transjokes. Though I think the certain rules that who gets to joke about what are really enough. Cis people shouldn't do transjokes. It can't work. Furthermore it's good to stop and think who are usually being joked about. The minorities, the disadvantaged etc. Rarely the jokes everyone have heard of are about the one's in power. I mean never. That's why defending offensive jokes with the idea that comedy  just 'should make people laugh' or that it's 'just a joke' or it's just your sensitiveness that is at fault is utter bullshit. Humour is related to power and hierarchies in societies. It's never void of that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think I am going to write a few comedy acts about my life. Not for anyone else, just for myself. I'll see this as an exorcise in bettering my mental health... time to have a go at myself and find the light in my darkness. Honestly as I type this, I am reminded of how crippling my nihilism can be as I try to sleep before work. The absurdity of it made me laugh. The idea of me dwelling on my own mortality, something I can't control, inevitably marching forward making everything I do irrelevant keeps me up. It prevents me from getting the rest I need to go to work, make the money that I need to live ... so that I can ... die? Dark comedy gold.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Nice video. I see what you're saying and you make good points, but I have to disagree. We're never going to all have heard the same jokes or possess the same knowledge on subjects so humor will be very different to each and every one of us. It's one of those where we have to agree to disagree that humor can be offensive to some and hilarious to some. Of course humor can show a persons (and the crowds) ignorance, but ignorance isn't always the evil it's portrayed to be. Everyone can't be read up and educated on every subject and transgendered people are far back in most peoples list of what to be educated about. Alot of your average joes have never heard those transjokes you mentioned. Transpeople are going to have to accept that alot of people will never be fully educated on the matter, just like I as a straight white male accept that the discourse on men having around double the suiciderates and much higher rates of depression than women, men are the ones who first and foremost have to live with the downsides of machoculture and male aggression; yet still we get shat on constantly in comedy. I'm never going to side with my rightwing whitemale snowflake counterparts and go around crying and being offended for this, rather I accept that people just don't care enough to read up on every group and their strifes and we're never going to 100% relate to their lives and situations.  Case in point: The Gigi story wasn't really funny to me at all, likely because it was so incredibly unrelatable. And I think I have similarly dark and edgy humor where my favorite humor shows include it's always sunny in philadelphia and the office.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This chic is 100% right about the comedy culture war. You have 2 major groups, indie-pop comedians who think they are fighting for truth and justice, and then you have bad-boy comedians who think they are the second coming of Andrew Dice Clay and overcompensate to attacks SJWs. Comedy is a craft and its purpose is humor and laughter, thinking its high art causes the stand-up comedian from both sides to just end up masturbating in front of a crowd. Most comedy has fallen to this trap of thinking its more important than it really is. At least there are still some great humorists left in this world, podcasts like High Society Radio have been going strong for many many years and have never fallen to such pitfalls. They are a group that deserve the years of acclaim they have received from the comedy community.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You really made me think about this one. Honestly, you most often do. (Btw, sorry about previous comments I might have been a bit... edgy about the themes, no pun intended. Honestly, it's partly what happens when one thinks the author of the video is not going to read the comment but somebody else might. So telling what you think becomes an imperative. Anyways.) I am thinking about the nature of comedy here... and I kinda came to this conclusion (or at least impression) comedy is always about the unexpected, the subversion, so when we live in a society of political-correctness, politically incorrectness goes. But when everything is politically incorrectness, politically correctness (aka owning up the assholes) becomes the predominant form of comedy. This also has different effect on people who *know* what the political correctness denounces and those who doesn't, and viceversa.   Btw, I think today is a moment of predominant political incorrectness (so much so, being politically correct is the new politically incorrect). Which means, this is probably the best time to be political correct... Well, at least that's my own impression but that's probably because I'm surrounded by politically incorrect idiots who don't know anything hurting people with their lack of sense or empathy... so politically correcting/owning people is pretty much the only thing that makes me laugh right now. That's my experience anyways.   PD. I don't like 'hello darkness my old friend' song *because* of the major tone shift, because I feel it doesn't commit to its darkness-ness.

"I don't know what's particularly masculine about your singing voice.   I was looking for articles on the biomechanics of singing and found an article from the nineties that measured tension in the larynx during singing.  looked at amateur and professional singers by gender, and found that they fell into three groups: amateur female singers had the highest laryngeal tension, professional female singers the lowest, with amateur and professional male singers indistinguishable by laryngeal tension.   The takeaway: men are assigned the pitch ranges most friendly for humans in general, while women are expected to distinguish themselves with an unnaturally high range, which requires unhealthy tension of untrained individuals, while professionals become the only of the four groups to actually use vocal techniques.   My only complaint about your singing voice is that it sounds like you think you're a joke.  It's not funny.  You're just some lady singing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This made me think of Veep. I know it's a show about a bunch of horrible people and the insults are a big part of it but I do feel they really crossed a line in season 6. There's this episode where Jonah's uncle hurls the most hurtful but creative stuff at him at a hospital when he's at his most vulnerable and it's just brutal. Thing is, Jonah's fiancee, a cis woman, is there too, and the uncle asks who the tr**ny knuckle dragger is. There is nothing about her that would be a stereotypical feature of a transwoman; she's just a regular woman who is neither very beautiful or unattractive. It comes completely out of nowhere and googling the quote makes it seem that people liked it a lot - just like the entire hospital exchange.   I can't imagine Veep doing the same joke where the and the uncle suddenly greets the fiancee with a racial slur implying she's a POC and the scene still goes on like it worked great as an insult, like it looks bad for Jonah to be dating a black woman or for a woman to be seen as brown. Sure, it's great that they respect the viewers' intelligence and don't spell out that these people are bad everytime someone says something horrible. However, in this scene you're clearly supposed to actually cheer for the uncle who rips into the asshole that is Jonah. It's scary but triumphant. Every line he utters makes you go 'holy shit, he destroyed him', so when he drops the T-word it's clear that this is supposed to be vicious, that this is bad and embarrasing and insulting to Jonah and his fiancee.  Everybody makes a big point of how Veep pulls no punches and it's just vile, brutal and packed with dark shit. Sure, I watch it too. But what this particular scene does is imply that being a transwoman equals unattractive, being attracted to a woman equals shameful and transgender equals insult. It made me very uncomfortable and I'm glad I was watching this alone and not with straight, cis boyfriend who's proud of me. I couldn't find one review where someone felt the same way and that's... very disappointing.   At least Always Sunny stopped with that bullshit.

"Having watched the Ricky Gervais special with people who are both adverse to political correctness and gender conservative, I was interested to note that they, just like my SJW ass, didn't laugh once either. 15 very awkward, strained minutes. The jokes were just offensively unfunny.    We did however laugh over his jokes about his own aging body, which, in my opinion landed, as they had some funny, absurd imagery. More importantly they also drew on relatable, personal experience not some misguided bitterness over his anti political correctness-crusade.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Joking about everyone binds us all together, when you make it so, oh you can't joke about that group, then we don't bind with that group because everyone is too on edge of getting ostracized for a misstep and so communication with that group slowly breaks down. Its fine to criticize comedy or jokes, but don't ask for them to be de platformed or damage a persons life over a joke or a misstep. Also don't ostracize people for not knowing or understanding things, when you didn't know or understand something in the past, you probably said and thought stupid misconceptions too, we all know different things to different degrees, most people won't know all about trans issues, where as trans people are much more likely to look into that stuff, give people some grace and try to help them see your point of view, this is how you gain acceptance, not through ending people who don't understand, know, disagree or take a misstep.

"21:50-22:11--Oh, wow, did that hit home. I'm not transgender, but I've been visually impaired since birth. The notion of having to perform, to be a good representative of a minority community people happen to be a part of, can be very burdensome at times. Also, thank you for pointing out Carlin's 'Cripples!' joke. People with disabilities often get left out of conversations about diversity and being aware of not-normals (love that term, by the way!), so again, thanks.   As for the rest of this video, I loved it. Your take on comedy is fantastic. It makes me wonder: Have you read 'The Man Who Laughs' by Victor Hugo? If not, I think you'd really enjoy it. Even the title is wonderfully macabre and sarcastic, as the protagonist earns his living performing as a clown because he was scarred with a Glasgow smile when he was a boy. It's a fantastic novel, full of dark humor and tragic romance--the clown has a relationship with a blind girl--and, based on your video, I highly recommend it to you.

But Gervais and other edgelord comedy guys is that they've made it clear they don't care about who they're offending, or why, or what those people think.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Ricky Gervais has always been a bit of a prick in his stand-up. I feel like it's the way he tells them. I feel like he _wants_ to offend people in some capacity, so comes out with these intentionally shitty jokes. It's not that he _actually_ means it but... _y'know._ He's not the only popular comedian that does it but he's definitely the most smarmy about it.  As for self depreciation humour, I find that if not done correctly it absolutely turns into self humiliation like you say. If you look at the occasional disabled comedian (usually people with Cerebral Palsy for some reason) that is given a bit on someone else's show you'll see it straight away. I find it really cringey most of the time and it seems to serve a kind of internal virtue signalling that a lot of people seem to hold. Like it somehow makes them a better person because they laughed at a joke told by a disadvantaged group, even when the jokes themselves rely really heavily on slurs and physical appearance. I see it as a kind of pity/social pressure comedy (not to be confused with empathy humour from comedians like Amy Schumer) that's, in my view, more harmful than helpful.

"I really loved Ricky Gervais for years, but he - and other comedians - need to be tougher in these times. They talk about being brave enough to make harsh, edgy jokes - but that's not reaaaally bravery. Controversy gains them fame. Negative criticism from 'the establishment' is just free advertisement, the best comedians have always been the controversial ones, Richard Pryor was extremely controversial in his time - and is a legend ever since.   The brave move would be to take a stance, and risk alienating half their fan-base. That's what I'm waiting and watching out for - an edgy comedian who decides to let all his little fascist-kiddo fanbase know that they can all go fuck themselves.

"Ah, it is about edgelords. I guessed right.  Sometimes it feels like young people gravitate to taboo positions simply for the aesthetic, not realising that other people end up just finding you annoying. If you want to go to dark places, please take the subject matter seriously, and/or make fun of it (and do your research). Otherwise, you lose the thread of rationality that keeps you from getting lost in conspiracies and stuff.  This is one of my favourite topics. I disagree with Natalie that it's a balancing act between snowflake sensibility and edgelord aesthetics. This is a framing provided to you by the good friendly neighbourhood ultraconservatives. If we take a more scientific look, comedy is a tool to expose flaws in our logic. It has to be irreverent, to everything. If it's not helping to show us truths we didn't realise, it's being abused as a tool. This irreverence is not edgelordism. It's brutal application of logic to places it's not supposed to go according to authority. As for the snowflake side, allow it to evaporate in a puff of logic. Snowflakes are not a political position. They are an invention of people who don't like their authority challenged.  Of course you might say comedy is about entertainment. And this is true as well. But it works through engaging cognitive dissonance (in a safe feeling environment).  Also sorry Natalie that you have to be a representative of the community.

And I totally get how safe spaces, despite how needed they are, can be suffocating. As someone who often speaks their mind, making countless jokes without fully thinking them out, I've said things that I still stand by as funny but didn't go over well. But with my squad of trans friends who all understand a level of memeiness to come from each other, this would have been fine. Because we're on the gallows together so we get to share in gallows humour. Also im happy you mentioned Hannah Gadsby, because I do think that only dwelling on the funny parts of stories and not mentioning the devastating aftermath can prevent healing and growth. But you can't be sad all the time. I'm too sad too much of the time. So yeah","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"But are good jokes only about the details and depth of insight? Maybe the generalization and stereotype bit is as important? Ricky's stage persona is a miserable lower class douche, and his lack of knowledge and care is part of characters misery. His is the minority group 'aging ugly fat people' which is not a joke. I don't think he is trying to be a tough rough truth teller. The cigar is irony and self loathing. So his main object of assault ans loathing is short, fat, balding, lonely working class British man who has falling behind the modernity and becomes increasingly isolated and confused. Trans issues is just a provocation, a reference to his point of view just like christian or family related themes in other comedians material.  Also.. Nanette is almost not a stand up. It like.. a therapy breakthrough..","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is first video of yours I'm watching and I admit I went in expecting to vehemently disagree with your take. I feel humbled and appreciative of how thorough and sophisticated your arguments are. You present the case for more socially-conscious and rigorous comedy with more depth and class than 99% of pundits I've come across. As a cranky 'modern culture get off my lawn' type, you gesture to a future that I can believe in. It's cathartic and makes me less terrified about where the world is going.  You mentioned Aristotle and I think the idea virtue and the golden mean is a good framework for understanding some of the tensions you raise. It seems like the best comedy is inherently trangressive, but that needs to be balanced with humility and care not to overreach. And maybe the same thing can be applied to self-deprecation. Having seen Nanette, I could sense how deep Hannah Gadsby's rage was felt - but her jokes at her own expense (and your own expense) that help people like me empathise and understand where you're coming from. Self-deprecation is incredibly powerful but I hope it doesn't ever come at the expense of people actually valuing themselves.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"To bring up everyone's favorite asshole philosopher Nietzsche, tragedy works in a similar way. It takes 'the darkness' of living and 'redeems' it (or affirms life to use his language). It helps you understand how how all the horrible things are necessary in big picture. Without all the problems and mysteries, life wouldn't be so amazing and interesting. Handling 'the darkness' with humor does a similar thing.   May Dark Mother Anita bless satire, the greatest of genres, and protect the apostles Laurence Sterne, Jonathan Swift, Francois Rabelais, Desiderius Erasmus, Mark Twain, Ambrose Bierce, and others.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Poster print of this thumbnail when?  The appeal to comics like Bruce, Burr, Gervais, and Carlin to justify saying anything to get a laugh irks me to no end. I can't speak on the first three, but I can say Carlin's bits on words and euphemisms weren't about being crappy or 'speaking the truth.' They were about not obscuring meaning, which _isn't the same thing._ He wasn't saying that calling people 'large' instead of 'fat' withheld some divine and necessary truth that they need to hear and would otherwise be lost if not uttered. He was offering that 'fat' is more accurately descriptive.  That said, Carlin never delved into the prescriptive meanings carried by some of the words and phrases that people became more hesitant to use over time. His argument that people stopped using 'fat' to deny being fat simply isn't true. 'Fat' fell out of fashion because people finally understood how laden it is with assumptions and nastiness, and they didn't wish to dump all of that onto someone by using that word to describe them. Ditto for the ableist slur example in the video. People realized these words were harmful because they either were no longer or ever merely descriptive.  Still, Carlin was first and foremost an entertainer. He built his comedy around things he found interesting ('small things,' 'big things,' and language) and worked hard to make those things entertaining to others. He wanted to make people laugh, think, and hopefully take better care of each other. Anyone who instead uses his work to justify being glib, insensitive, or cynical dishonors his memory.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"One time I called myself (a nonbinary person) a tranny to one of my friends just because I think it's funny (keep in mind he is cis) and he said to me 'I dont think you're allowed to say that because you're not actually trans.' I was flabbergasted. A cis person really just told me, a nonbinary person intending to have breast reduction surgery to better be able to bind on days when I feel more masculine and who changed their name to better fit who they are, that I am not trans. And it felt like he was trying to take away the comedy of the whole situation from me. Like I will never be able to instantly be recognizable as nonbinary because their is no nonbinary 'look.' I will have to constantly keep coming out to people for the rest of my life in order to feel comfortable just existing and I can't even have the simple pleasure of joking around with a slur intended for the group I identify with? I am going to be dealing with this forever and I'm not even allowed to find how miserable it makes me funny? That's really some bullshit right there.

"Something that I've noticed about edgy humor is that it always boils down to simply referencing one thing about a topic (for instance, Ricky Gervais's joke just amounts to 'Caitlyn Jenner had GRS done') where dark humor at least has a sense of irony or context to it. I love dark humor about the fact that I'm Jewish and I love hearing people's nervous laughter when I say shit like 'let's play monopoly, I'll control the bank' but if a comedian just went on stage and said 'Jews run the banks' it wouldn't be nearly as funny because there's no sense of how 'wrong' the joke is.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Interesting thesis. Counterpoint: Your jokes that conflate a penis on oestrogen and a penis belonging to a woman (i.e. your mouthfeel joke and your bit about the 'feminine penis' in the are t***s gay video) aren't funny and are indicative of your recent body of works' underlying message of 'if you wanna be valid you gotta be on hormones' and that it feels like you've entrenched this message into your personal brand as much as mood lighting and fake nails worries me because I know so many contrapoints-stanning binary trans women who are very influenced by you and it's such a toxic idea.  Whether you chose to be a mouthpiece for the transfeminine community or large or not (and I would argue that, making as much content about it as you do, you have, at least since you released the aesthetic, opted to be one) you need to realise you are also a mouthpiece TO your own community about themselves too. Say I'm an egg from a small town and I don't know any other trans people irl or online, I find your channel and you are the gateway to what I think the community thinks about itself. If you are to act as an educator, you have a responsibility to be sure you aren't spreading Transmedicalist Lite.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I don't think good comedy requires transgression, but many comics feel like its the only way to be honest...I would direct you to Mulaney or Gary Gullman as examples of comics that are not trying to drill down for an existential truth; they are simply giving you a bit they have honed into a hilarious spear. Gullman's bit about state abbreviations is amazing, and it is about nothing.   Comics who revere George Carlin (who, I admit, is perhaps my favorite comic) often hit on the transgressive aspects of his work, and not the supposed truth at which he was hammering (obviously, the old crank era, not the early parts).  When you do that, you get a thirteen-year-old's version of his act.   Which describes Gervais' act succinctly.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

He highlights the absurdity of some of his own personal experiences and pokes fun at himself all the time, but not once have I ever heard him make a joke at the expense of a marginalized group of people.

It's like almost terror and it's kind of offensive but it's so dramatic that I laugh, then I think, this is how we get through it though.

"That moment when you talk about safe spaces  is so relatable as someone with mental illness. Like I need to be around other edgy (as you put it) mentally ill people, so I can call myself cr*zy without the neurotypicals freaking out and wanting me shut away in an attic.  There's so much funny shit that I do, that like I can't talk about around NTs because it's *inappropriate*. And I know being up front about personal experiences with other mentally ill or neurodivergent people can be triggering, so there needs to be space and fair warning given. But sometimes people also think I'm romanticizing mental illness, which doesn't seem fair. Laughing at the situation one finds oneself in (and in my case will always will be in because it's a chronic condition) is not the same as romanticizing it, but I digress.

I use to want to hide my natural lower vocal placement, and it was difficult particularly with singing - cuz I couldn't use my voice fully.

"Vivian mentioned this, but it's important to note that the reason accurate humor relating to the Darkness is seen as tame or not funny is because it knows too much pertaining on that visceral Darkness. Those who don't share your darkness, as you describe, don't always find the Darkness as funny as when they see the effects of the Darkness, thus comedy is borne of misery. This misery is not the powerful internal one, but the different external one of knowing that you know nothing of the subject yet denying it to almost mock them for experiencing it.

"I hope that you read this Natalie. You have a beautiful soul and mind and your song is pure. You may feel insecurity concerning your singing voice and it's sad because you have such a gift for music. I recommend you look at Anna Varney. She is a gorgeous woman and has the most moving voice. She is a very popular artist in the Goth subculture and she creates absolute masterpieces singlehandedly for Sopor Aeternus (see In Der Palastra; The Virgin Queen). She is a transgender mtf and her singing voice sounds masculine but it still resonates her femininity and elegance. Song is powerful. I was born female and my singing voice has literally scared my mom because she thought a man was singing outside the front door. I'm a natural tenor and my voice is extremely masculine. If music is a passion of yours, please don't feel you have to give it up in your transition. I love when you jam on the piano and sing your heart out,  you have so many talents and it is irresistible hearing your songs. P.S. this cover of the Sound of Silence is my favorite and your voice is breathtaking ","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"For me the self-deprecation started early since I was often picked on as soon as 1st grade. Obviously I hadn't transitioned then, so being a 'boy' that was always the shortest of my class, I was an easy target. Eventually I realized that if I made midget jokes before the other students could, I would 1. make them laugh, which gave me well-craved social cred and 2. get them to stop making these jokes. It worked well and I managed to make my high school years uneventful as a result. Nowadays I do the same thing, except the subject of my jokes is my trans/queerness, depression, and the sweet release of death, because gender dysphoria and depression is what I struggle with instead of bullies. It's just a part of my personality at this point, and it helps me stay afloat when the times are a bit more overwhelming.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I just want to mention that I laughed for five straight minutes twice during this video:  'It's like an orgasm for sad people' and 'Jean-Jacques Visage du Poisson'. The simple comedy of a completely absurd sentence is something very much undervalued. And by the way, that is your signature (well, that and your characters: like Justine and Tabby) far more than the occasional bits of self-deprecation. There is no need to feel that you must torture yourself for your art: your command of the English language and the French language is enough to make you a better comedian than Ricky Gervais could ever hope to be.  On another note: can we please stop idolizing atheist comedians already? atheism is now more common than religiosity and making jokes about God hasn't been taboo or 'edgy'  since I grew adult teeth.   Comedians: go fall in love with your language. Love it passionately, and make your art serve it. Delve into it's complexity, and dizzying variety. Do not insult and abuse your language by falling back on lazy, outdated and offensive jokes. There is no excuse for that when you have wordplay, and other semantic shenanigans.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Loved this. The beginning narration reminded me of a guy I know who once told me he loves edgy humour because (like me) it makes him feel better. He immediately used that exact Ricky Gervais routine as an example. I changed the subject as quickly as possible, because I like him and didn't want to get annoyed. I hadn't even seen the routine, but I knew on some level it would be shit. Over the months it kept creeping in: 'why does he need to feel better about trans stuff? Unless he's secretly trans, he has no stake in this'. He kept on making references to the Facebook genders and non-binary identities in a joking way, although he also brought up a documentary on trans people and spoke in a confused but somewhat respectful way about it. I think what he meant by using this as an example was that it eased his anxiety about the existence of people he didn't understand but didn't want to offend. He's not an out and out bigot, just a but clueless. This routine helped him relax by seemingly freeing him of the moral obligation to put too much effort into accommodating trans people. The type of person who likes the routine also wouldn't understand a word of the edgy, self-deprecating humour in places like r/transcirclejerk. I might show him this video if the topic comes up again.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Yay! ContraPoints has a new video!  Comedy and taboo share a thin line. One taboo that has come to light lately is that 'x' wasn't that person's story  (or joke) to tell. It think this was a point made in the video. If so - agreed! Point of view is everything. It's best to avoid telling survivors, regardless of type of abuse, how to feel about their experience...or worse, to perpetuate the abuse verbally. Freedom vs. License. I'm looking at Carlos Mancia, who was popular about 10 years ago, would never have been tolerated in the 60s, and whose type of humor would not be popular now.  But, society needed to get here because of how intensely restricted things had been. It was fascinating to see the contrasts and range from family-themed Carol Burnett to not-family-themed Richard Pryor to edgy Lennie Bruce in the 70s - while society was becoming open to adult themed media.   Now there's a return to the need for taboos, new ones that are more ethically responsible...back into the darkness. ;)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I recently had a funny experience with an alcoholic friend of mine.  She comes downstairs, drunk and sobbing uncontrollably because her computer isn't working and she's in the middle of a timed online test (she goes to school online).  I asked if she's turned it off and on again and she says no.  After I reboot her computer, everything is working fine and she resumes her test (she passed, by the way).  I used to get in these really dark moods when she drinks because she's one of my best friends and she's said some really shitty things to me while drunk.  But for some reason, I just started laughing at her this time.  I think it was the combination of how disheveled she looked (hair all frizzy and standing up, eyes red and puffy from crying, snot everywhere) and the fact that the solution was such a simple and obvious one that made it so funny to me.   Anyway, my laughing and ribbing her about being drunk completely defused the situation and we ended up giggling until we couldn't breathe instead of fighting about it.  I'm not minimizing her problems (I nagged her incessently and now she's in counseling), but it reminded me that comedy can save you when it seems like nothing else can.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'Tragedy is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when you fall into an open sewer and die!'  --Mel Brooks   There are a pair of truisms within that statement from a man regarded as one of the greatest comedians of all time. The first is that perception changes reaction. The second is that the practice and enjoyment of humor has everything to do with detachment- by looking from the outside in, you can see the absurdity (and thus comedy) in just about anything.  This is where Natalie's 'Parable Of The Tightrope-Walker' comes into play- in order for your comedy to stand the test of time, you must find a balance between attachment and detachment. Becoming so attached to something that it makes you a moral scold is the 'Snowflakery,' whereas becoming so detached from everything you're willing to guffaw at acts of 'Man's Inhumanity To Man' without understanding the how or why is the 'shitposting.' Natalie said it better than I could- you can only sit back and watch the world burn if you aren't the one on fire. Truly inspiring and art-worthy comedy comes from being able to laugh at being on fire- the way Mel Brooks can take the persecution and torture of Jews during the Spanish Inquisition and turn it into a Busby Berkeley-style musical number, or use the idea of a black man as the heroic sheriff of a small town on the American Frontier as a jumping-off point for discussing racism in the Western movie-genre. As both a Jew and a comedic filmmaker, Mel Brooks is able to find humor in both the persecution of his own people and the flaws inherent in his profession as a director of movies.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is definitely a topic that I was thinking about a great deal at various points (yeah, that's as specific as I can get), because I'm aware of how horrifically offensive my humour can be when in private or in company that knows I'm only joking, and I've struggled to work out what aspects I find offensive and what I don't when often the topic is the same. For me, as I feel you alluded to here, it has a lot to do with direction. If you're making jokes about yourself or your own personal experiences, that evokes a sense of trustworthiness or transparency that you wouldn't get with a comedian who only jokes about other people. People who self-deprecate, regardless of their demographic, expose that they don't consider themselves beyond making fun of, and are therefore probably better than those who just prefer punching down. And this goes a way also to explaining some of my own tastes in humour - focusing on a topic that in itself is rather dated in its humour - shorts from the Golden Age of Animation! 'Cause, y'know, why pick something more modern and adult? Tom and Jerry ones have always been my favourites, and honestly part of it was probably because of how nobody in the shorts was immune to slapstick - or at least, everyone was just as likely to be subjected to the same amount of it. In the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies cartoons, for all the things they did right, you always had your trickster characters, like Bugs Bunny or the Roadrunner, or Tweety, who were virtually always guaranteed a win, and tended not to get distorted or smashed up a great deal. And whilst Jerry was usually the victor in the famous cat-and-mouse team, it wasn't absolutely guaranteed, nor was it guaranteed his journey to that victory would be a smooth ride. The two of them always felt like partners in mutually screwy situations, where whoever got the upper hand could change frequently, playing with expectations and keeping the humour fresh, compared with others were the protagonists were constantly in control of every encounter, and were never blindsided, leaving them harder to root for.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The Carlin joke contains a meta joke that is the exact joke she describes. He's taking the concept too far intentionally. He's making it stupid, because if you don't make it stupid, and take it to its extreme, it's not really a joke, it's just a social commentary with comedic pacing, and that can get heavy pretty quickly, because who the fuck is any comedian to tell anyone what's correct. He doesn't really think you should call anyone a 'cripple,' he's using an outdated, inaccurate, stupid concept and putting it on the same table as the other ideas for the automatic juxtaposition and gut check that extremes tend to provide when grouped with reasonable ideas.  It's basically the same thing as saying 'sex change operation.' Well, it's for the same reason. It's a thing he did all the time.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think when youve just come out you need those safe spaces because every other space, the degree obviously dependant on where you are, feels unsafe. You feel vulnerable. But once you've been socially transitioned for a while and seen what the world has to offer you (in terms of how bad it gets) you need that sometimes edgy humour to be able to get over it. Instead of falling into depression because of how the world sees you as you might do when you're early in transition, you can laugh it off. And when you're a public figure you need to be both because there are both in your audience. Joking in that way is something you need to be really close to a person to do because you need to make sure exactly what they're thinking when you make that joke. At least that's my experience.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Wonderful vid as always, now I'm hankering for some Doug Stanhope or Patton Oswalt.   Really interesting observation about needing a 'safe space for my edginess'.  It seems in a way you off-handedly explained in a sentence what many comedians are trying to convey. Many I've listened to have bemoaned the presence of cell phones and/or bloggers at their shows, and in some ways it is a violation of what is arguably in a fashion a safe space.  While there are plenty of proper douchebags hiding their bigotry behind comedy, there are as well comics coming into the crossfire merely for doing their job.    It seems like a hurdle we need to overcome in the digital age, a sort of redefining of our public and private 'faces'.  It's not news that we all have things we'd say in certain company but not others, yet in a time when there's seemingly a camera at hand anytime, anywhere as a society we've yet to really publicly recognize that.  We operate under the premise that anything said or done is free to be judged in whichever light it is viewed whenever it is viewed.  It is certainly going to be interesting to see how we all adapt to this as our society runs against a tenant of our own psyches'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I really believe that there are no rules in comedy.  Punch in any direction.  Use the darkness of others.  Be as ignorant or as enlightened on a topic as you want to be.  The only thing that matters is if you can get a laugh.     Comedians have to be able to say anything and go anywhere.

"Jesus fucking Christ, this is SO FUCKING IT!!! The timing of this is amazing, as I just had another conversation with a couple friends about what comedy should be, which was one of many. I actually agree with the balance you talk about 100%, though I can see why that self-depreciation, and love of dark humor doesn't work for some people.   Idk, it's like, comedy is one of the most subjective art forms there is imo, and there are many 'kinds' of humor that I love that I totally get why someone might hate, but I think that when it comes to what's 'permissible', we really need to be thinking about comedy differently than normal conversation or interactions. I do think that when it comes to offensive comedy, that the most offensive stuff really is the edgy that completely fails to be funny and is simultaneously legitimately ignorant, but at the same time, I'm really not into the 'snowflake' stuff, as you call it, that actually fails to be humorous. If one's comedy is JUST about punching up and/or speaking truth to power, but severely lacking in any actual jokes or humor, well, is that actually comedy still? (ps - this was a major problem I had with much of Nanette, but I don't want to get into that) Don't get me wrong, I think comedy should strive to punch up, for the most part, but I do object to the notion that comedy MUST do this, and that it's somehow problematic if it fails to do so..   Anyway, idk why I'm rambling on, bc like I said, I agree with how you put it completely. You are sooo fucking important, Natalie. The left needs the kind of critical thinking and fairly reasoned insight that you have, not to mention your sense of humor! [?][?]","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Most times, theyre told by people who have only ever encountered black people through rap music or at the DMV and are just looking for a clever way to have an excuse to say the N word out loud.

"The mechanics of stand up comedy is to construct a straw man for yourself and then fire off jokes from that. It is often a caricature of yourself to whom you can ascribe over simplistic misinterpretations of the world for comic effect.  People laugh when you reflect their own stupidity back at them but let them off the hook by taking it to a more absurd level and making them seem rational in comparison.  I don't know how you can work subtle and nuanced explanations of minority topics into that medium and still be funny. I really enjoyed Nannette and got a lot out of it, but let's be honest, it wasn't a laugh fest. A comedic film can be subtle and compassionate and whatever you want it to be as the medium is great for it, but when someone is on their own in a roomful of strangers trying to make them laugh, there is not a lot of wiggle room. It is only a step away from clowning. Set it up, knock it down, get the laugh, repeat. The best conscious subverting of this is that I have seen, by another Australian lesbian stand up, who has created a sexist stand up called Dave who doesn't know he isn't real. She morphs in and out of him, to Daves great distress as he starts to have doubts about the nature of his existence. It is properly belly laugh funny.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You're literally hilarious and I love your work. Finally smart comedy on youtube.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I think that a big part of what makes 'edgy' humor either offensive or inoffensive is whether or not people feel INCLUDED by the comedy or EXCLUDED by it. If you're telling a joke about yourself and your experience, and you're inviting people in to participate in it, it means you're opening the door for people to perceive emotional intimacy. However if you're telling a joke that targets people in a way to other them and push them away, they're more than likely not gonna like it. Like, ANY joke that targets somebody for exclusion is gonna make those people feel not great about it, and their response will either be to laugh at the expense of their self image by saying, 'yes I am trash haha, you sue go me' or being offended by it.  However you can do a lot of other work surrounding that joke to facilitate a feeling of camaraderie and inclusion, even surrounding topics that would usually alienate the people you're targeting. Dave Chapelle does this a lot, and for the most part gets away with it. He still obviously hits that wall where he's pushed too hard (usually by invalidating or poking fun at the entire existence of a group of people, calling into question whether or not their experience is valid), but he's made a career of being both incredibly offensive and also very funny.  I think this balance is why it's easiest for people of minority status to do humor about their own shit: they can almost automatically pull in people from their own demographic and have the added benefit of making people from other demos feel included in the joke. We get to feel closer, and like we're sharing in our experiences.  I could go on, but damn this long already, huh?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This was... the best video I have seen in a long time. Like, you perfectly explained comedy. I've been feeling the darkness surrounding my mental health a lot recently, and I've learned that I need comedy. I have a tendency to be painstakingly serious with myself and my problems, which only weighs me down. Also, the balance of snowflakery and shitposting reminds me of my tumblr. Sometimes I feel bad about reblogging the memes that perfectly describe, in a funny, self-deprecating way, the darkness that I'm feeling. My blog is all about love and positivity, so reblogging that sometimes makes me feel like I'm smearing harmful shit on my followers' dashboards, despite it making me feel better about myself and despite knowing that it could be relatable to them as well. So, I try to keep that balance, and most of my blog is sincere and clear love and positivity rather than solely shitposting with undertones of love through relatability. I'm no comedian, but my much-less-effort-requiring blogging works in a sort of similar way, which is interesting. Actually, maybe this concept works for basically everything social. In talking to friends, in talking to the public, in being a comedian, in being a youtuber, in being a musician, in blogging on tumblr... in all avenues in which we are social, we are always trying to make this comedic balance sit equal.

"I live on self depreciating humor. I have depression, and after years of hard work, I'm doing better than before, but i did self harm and attempt suicide twice. Only my bf and my family know about that. So now when I'm irritated or too upset and my bf asked me what I'm going to do I say 'idk prolly kill myself' every time. At first it made him uncomfortable. Tbh it made me uncomfortable too because we both knew it was a real possibility. But the more I said it, the less I meant it, and the more he heard it, the less seriously he took it. Now it's like a 'remember at that point in my life where a situation like this actually would have made me try to kill myself? Isn't it funny that that's not the case anymore?'

"I started binge watching The League of Gentlemen again. I forgot how good it is. League of Gentlemen is dark and macabre and often uncomfortable viewing but the heart of what makes it funny is the way it takes familiar, everyday problems, and exaggerates and twists them and mixes in strange and unsettling ideas to create something grotesque and humorous. The ultimate punchline is almost invariably about the British collective psyche, the ways we make our own lives harder or have them made harder by incompetent or unpleasant people, and how awful and decaying towns in rural Britain often are. To me, the essence of good dark humour is making boring or mundane or merely depressing things easier to talk about by making them shocking or horrifying or strange.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This was a brilliant and nuanced take about dark comedy and its function. I think in particular, when you analyze George Carlin's 'cripple' bit hints at how we should evolve 'the tension' between what you refer to as the 'snowflake' and 'shitpost' sensibilties of comedy.   The cripple joke is bad not just because it openly and shamelessly uses an ableist slur, but its underlying assumptions are factually incorrect.You correctly (in my opinion) point out that most of the bit you pulled from about corporate sensitized language is spot on. In art, it's generally an agreed upon curtiousy to critique the art and not the artist. Person makes bad thing does not make person a bad person, yet we don't extend this curtiousy to stand up comedians. I say 'generally agreed upon' because if an artist spends their entire career making for example, thiny veiled nazi propoganda, we can reasonably infer they're a bad person. I think we can strike a similar balance when discussing comedy - trying to focus more on the joke and what's problematic about it rather than assuming the person themselves is problematic.   That's not to excuse Ricky Gervais types, who themselves are the biggest most triggered special snowflakes of all. There are plenty of his ilk that show absolutely no intellectual curiousity, but in general, I think critiquing the joke seperately from critiquing the person is the most productive form of art criticism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

You feel their ego falls in love with its abilities and these villain archetypes will make sure enough of what they do is morally correct enough and seemingly insightful enough to justify getting away with a romantic narcissism. The villain is always a man that rejected his ideal and became feminine. This channel is like Milo to me because both her and Milo do make genuinely good arguments for the 'left' or the 'right', but they seem to make those good arguments in bad faith. This is why they are so entertaining to their audiences; you either become a villain too by joining them for the ride, or you're an onlooker who likes to see them do their tight-rope walk from a distance, wondering whether the stunt is just a manifestation of their ego or not","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I understand The Darkness well. As both the Token Gay at work, and the Token Cripple, I'm someone who does tend to use comedy/jokes to cover my real mood. I have a degenerate spinal disorder and am coming up on 15 years after the spinal fusion surgery that quite literally saved my life but left me with chronic pain and arthritis at the young age of 19.   I also work at a VERY religious organization, so being gay caused a bit of a stir when I mentioned it (when a co-worker asked if I had an SO/bf) but my constant blatant joking about it (one thing I've always said is that I've *heard* so often that the lesbian dating scene is an endless pit of drama, but me and my gf have to be the most boring gays in existence, having done a stable long distance relationship for 7 years) saw things calming down. Every once in a while I get someone coming to me with the usual bout of Straight People Not Getting It questions (ie: when did you know when you were gay, have you tried being with a dude, etc)   SPEAKING OF: as a gay gal, talking about my (VERY) awkward straight sexual encounters is a darkness goldmine for me. Especially since people really like to try to ask if I've ever been with a dude as if that would somehow invalidate my gayness if I hadn't been. (Internally, I did struggle with that idea for years bc of family pressure to 'try to act straight').  So thank you, Natalie for understanding both The Darkness, and for pointing out that there are some of us that like a bit of edginess to our comedy (when it comes from one of us/is actually funny bc they know what they're talking about)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You see this is one I hold in great importance. I've always used humour as a coping mechanism because I see it like this. Other people will laugh at you for anything, but they expect you to take yourself seriously, otherwise their jokes don't work. I understand the importance of safe spaces and whatnot, I get it, it feels good to not have to worry about your problems and just be accepted for who you are, but once you exit that space, what have you really learned, what has really changed? Not a lot. You come out of that environment, and you're essentially the same person as when you came in, with all the same issues. It's like using alcohol or drugs to drown the pain out, sure it makes it feel better on that night, but the next morning you're stuck with the same old mess you were beforehand, and perhaps even more worryingly, the validation can become addicting. I think through humour, especially dark humour, we are forced to come to terms with the darker aspects of ourselves, and therefore learn to face up to them better. Discouraging this outlet I don't think is very helpful, the issue is not that we need to stop joking about these things, the issue is that we need better jokes about them, ones that come from understanding, pain and reliability. By that we all learn something, we all understand each other a little better, and ourselves too. Dark humour is literally vital to maintaining a society where we can grow as people, and have genuine self-reflection, we just need it to be good humour.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Interpersonal and group dynamics can be deep and perplexing. When I don't joke around with people, they mistake me for being very serious, because deep takes on science, politics, and philosophy somehow can't be perceived as casual and fun. But when I try joking around, people get outraged. And usually I am joking about my own difficult experiences. I have a talent for self-analysis and self-deprecation, but the people I try putting at ease or getting to think almost always interpret it as me making fun of them. And part of that is the darkness. I feel entitled to make fun of my own tragedies and absurdities, and am careful to not be judgemental or presumptuous of others' experiences. Many use this as a way to exclude me from my own troubles, saying that if I was *_really_* queer, autistic, communist, if I had *_ever really been_* homeless or sexually assaulted, that I would never hold these opinions nor find this humorous. So my self-deprecating humor comes off as evidence of disingenuity.   What I suspect is that this works OK with those who are open-minded about dealing with you. But if they already feel that their relationship with you is of an adversarial nature, then it gets interpreted as an excuse for further conflict.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I don't think I'll ever hear from you, but I'd like to, because for the first time ever, I don't agree. There isn't one type of joke telling though, but there is an objective formula to telling jokes. It's a formula I like to use because you can use it to tell the punchline. You can try this with anything and get an idea of what the punchline is. The idea of a joke is that the punchlines has to be the OPPOSITE of the norm in order to be funny. You say something normal, and then you say something ridiculous, and that's the punchline. Sometimes that happens when people tell true stories like GIGI, sometimes that happens when people invent ridiculous things things to say. The darkness is just a spectrum of that opposite punchline.   I wish you would have focused on Louis CK instead who really has said jokes that are not funny, there is no punchline. And that he's harassing trans people with his new jokes.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Good example someone pausing or saying a  euphemism instead of a swear word, is so much funnier than just swearing or sexual innuendo is another great example. Another is in The Inbetweeners they couldn't say cunt so they made the word clunge instead and that is such a funnier word in a sentence.

"I've heard people praise George Carlin as some kind of comedic prophet from the wilderness, speaking truth to the corrupt court of Babylon since I was a kid, and they seem to use his aphorisms to support whatever their political stance is - but every time I actually *look* at one of the routines, it's a really mixed bag, and it's not that I hate him or anything, but it seems to me that most of his humorous 'insight' comes from taking a nihilist slant on everything. 'Nothing matters, everyone's an asshole. Fuck you. Great joke. Audience laughs.' And the thing is... Nihilism is perfectly fine as a comedic conceit. It is, however, an absolutely shit worldview, and a terrible approach to social policy. If you take it outside the comedic context, it is revealed for what it is: entertainment. What I'm getting at is this: I fucking hate it when someone bemoans the stupidity of the 'general public' (whoever the fuck that is) by bringing up the whole 'the average person is dumb, and half are dumber'-joke as some kind of serious observation, because they always implicitly place themselves above average in intelligence, even when, statistically, they probably aren't. Most of them (bell curve, mind you), are probably bog-standard proles like myself, deseprately clinging to some niche where we excel so that we have some positive image to base our self-identity around.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Great, as always! During your talk, I felt there was something missing or something that didn't quite fit. You did approach it at the very end, and I agree with everything you said, but I still want to try and elaborate it: When you say that Carlin, Gervais et al. don't really deliver good comedy, this seems to mean 'for the audience they're targetting'. But if that audience actually does share a certain worldview, however misguided or unsophisticated, the real comedy is there, in the sense that the 'edginess' of 'exposing' a politically correct and imposed 'euphemism' or 'white lie' is cathartic - and that catharsis is certainly a vital ingredient of good comedy. When you then contrast this with a 'genuinely good joke' about e.g. transsexuals or any kind of minority or disadvantaged group etc., you are actually describing a good fit between artist and audience: they not only share the same worldview, but it is also an objectively more accurate and detailed worldview (of some particular and possibly narrow domain). Any serious comedian will face an impossible dilemma in trying to be both accurate and fair, and at the same time not seem 'snowflaky' to at least some of his or her audience - at least if the artist wishes to avoid screening that audience beforehand or limit themselves to very select audiences. It is partly out of the artist's control. Especially if the artist genuinely wants to broaden his or her subject matter beyond the least common denominator, or merely in order to get enough of a crowd to pay the bills. The paradox is that precisely those comedians who wish to walk the line and deliver genuinely funny and educational jokes must first educate the audience. And out goes the edginess. So, the cririque, or analysis, of what it takes to produce good comedy must take into account not only the joke, the comedian and the delivery, but also the audience and the reception. I do of course agree that comedy should not inteoduce or reinforce faulty stereotypes, incorrect or unsophisticated characterizations of subjects or people. (Though market and psychological forces tend to push comedy, as well as any kind of entertainment etc., in that direction.) But it is ineffective to blame individual comedians for being part of that evolutionary spiral. Especially since many of them may sincerely be trying to meet your balance criteria, and/or my enlightenment criteria - and believing that they are succeeding.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"When things like toxoplasmosis can make people suicidal just from worms in their brains changing their brain chemistry, have to admit that biology is somewhat artificial/alien to begin with.   I'm a cis fem with masculine features and have experienced being pursued by a more 'feminine' beautiful fem who was gay and was apparently the dominant 'male' personality in her lesbian relationships (I was even jealous of her until I realized she was interested in me rather than the boy I liked lol)...I'm also not attracted to what's considered to be conventionally masculine in males like big muscles and broad jawlines so, I find these tropes of what's supposed to be attractive for female versus male to be confusing anyway lol.  I guess my point is that being trans is as natural as not being trans, the only difference is that to become trans takes a traumatic medical regimen and that's probably why it's so stigmatized - people have a 'strawperson' to scapegoat their own identity transformation struggles that everyone experiences to some extent.   If it makes GiGi feel better, male DNA (without sperm) can be used to create a child genetically-related to them with donor sperm and a donor egg. It's not as easy though for a female-to-male trans with a female partner because they only have the XX genetic material.  Anyway, love your attitude it's refreshing.  Actually, a better example than toxoplasmosis to prove that biology is somewhat artificial/alien is mitochondria. It's an alien DNA that merged with our life cycle over time so that now we can't naturally reproduce or live without it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"the sad thing is that the whole reason Gervais' Office and his character of Brent was so funny is that it was about the withering void of the life of a supremely pathetic and useless man. Almost everyone can laugh at Brent's near constant pain because it's something we've all experienced on some level - but there was no happy ending or moral to these humiliating episodes. Brent's life was shit, and that was funny. It was dark, self-deprecating humour. Gervais seems to have forgotten that, having seemingly no self-awareness, with the result being pure cringe to rival the best of it.

Caucasian friends over the years have asked me why a comedian like Russel Peters can make fun of every race on Earth and people are fine with it, yet someone like a Gervais can't? I've never had an answer beyond 'We can say it, but you can't... you know...because of racism and stuff...'  I love the idea of the comedian 'knowing or not knowing the details' as you say.

Surely that sterilization process that takes place is a reminder that you're not a male anymore and you shouldn't be hoping to blend nature and society however you like and father a mother mother child? Moving on to Carlin I continue to wonder why it's worth talking about this topic. The point of the Comedy is to be irreverent in the first place. And that Darkness extends to people knowing full well they wouldn't want to be disabled, if they are disabled they probably don't want to be disabled....being disabled sucks and you are a drain on society.

It's ridiculous. And I'm tired of it. Ur darkness is unique and should be respected. And so is that of cis women apart of the historical category of those oppressed related to wombs / child carrying / birth / menstruation / menopause / infertility / abortions / 'female presenting secondary characteristics ( high voice , breasts etc)'   For you to place yourself into the category of 'biological woman' includes you in a group of people whose darkness you will never know directly until science advances to where you can have a womb, carry a child or not, menstruate, have menopause etc. in this way you're acting like Gervais.   You are not a biological woman; you are not oppressed as a biological woman. You are a trans woman; you are oppressed as a trans woman. You are a woman. And I am a woman. But we are not the same in our darkness. And to say so should not be counted as transphobic; it recognizes an important difference in our lived experiences.   The women of the world and lgbtqia+ community need each other. I'm tired of the schism between cis and trans women. We really need to respect each other's darknesses with equity and support each other. Trans women deserve support from cis women and cis women should use their privilege to elevate the voices of trans women. But we should not have to pretend our lived experiences are not what they are. Your lived experiences do not include my darkness contra. Did u get sent home cause ur period exploded in middle school all over ur pants? Did U lay around for hours in agony from cramps? Will you be called crazy when you're older cause ur experiencing menopause? I could go on and on. This is the darkness for cis or 'biological women' ... and ur darkness of being in a body ur dysphoric about has not been mine and for me to claim that would be disingenuous","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Natalie is awesome for posting a video like this because she speaks volumes about how it's difficult to make a joke that's both offensive and not offensive. I can appreciate a good dark joke like anyone else but I can understand why a 'I identify as a attack helicopter' isn't funny because it's trite, mean spirited, and punches down on people who don't deserve it. Also because a attack helicopter is a mechanical machine with no organic parts so you would be more like a cyborg than an attack helicopter if anything.  But mostly I love her videos because they are inciting and interesting and I always get to learn something new!  Also Natalie is my 11/10 Waifu if anyone says she is shit I will launch you into a rotating attack helicopter blade!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You read all the comments? Sounds like a lot of work. But I thought of something that may or may not be true: I live in a pretty rednecky place, and I'm not sure that when a lot of people based in this kind of place (economically besieged, uneducated, narrow cultural horizons, fetishizing  rural values) don't feel that they are punching down when they actually are is because they are told (in so many words) that what they regard as 'snowflake culture' is the dominant culture, so they consider themselves to be punching up, rather than down. And I think they think this way because they are deliberately misled to believe that the people who pose the greatest threat to them are not elite capitalists insanely focused on squeezing every last farthing out of every remotely commodifiable thing (who, after all, own the news outlets that are watched a lot in flyover country), but the dominant culture composed of LGBT- brown- Muslims who are out to git their kids and their guns and their jobs (I'm oversimplifying for brevity, but you probably know what I mean). I'm not saying that this theory of mine makes punching down jokes suddenly funny, if it's even true, but it might explain their existence and sorta-popularity. These people aren't mean (mostly, I think); they are victims of a deliberate propaganda.    Or maybe I'm unknowingly full of shit. I dunno.

"Criticism and Bolshevism have one thing in common. They both seek to pull down that which they could never build.     -----     Noel Coward  Lots of good points and many points of agreement. But humor is slippery, and really hard to catch. A joke explained may teach you something, but usually it's less funny the more you examine it. I didn't think Gervais' joke on Jenner was that funny, but neither does it seem that bad either. There was a choice to be made in whether he said '... not as much as _Bruce_ Jenner, obviously...' or '... not as much as _Caitlyn_ Jenner, obviously...' That might be a psychologically revealing choice, or maybe he just thought it funnier that way.  idk   And it's certainly in style with his general jokewrightsmanship - consider his previous apology the time before when he pissed people off: 'I like a drink as much as the next guy... unless the next guy is Mel Gibson' A comedian's job isn't really _social responsibility,_ - though of course it's nice when they coincide - their job is simply humor.

"I felt like this video was presented in the same way I would enjoy a banana split. First, I never get a banana split from a chain of any sort. Only from those local small town joints that make their own ice cream and only use the freshest ingredients, even if you have to drive 3 towns over. 2nd, no customizing. Accept the ingredient mixture as designed by the shop. As long as coconut is not involved and there is a cherry on each ice cream mound, you're golden.  Lastly, and most importantly, the cherries must be saved as a dessert for your dessert. Not to the side though, oh no. They must be allowed to swim in the delicious melted goodness inevitably collected in the dish. Not only will they have collected the whipped cream in which they were initially embedded and the aforementioned melted ice cream, but also remnants of the different toppings used as well as come chopped nuts, if you're lucky. Finally, I'd slowly enjoy the still cold maraschino cherries, steadily chewing, lost in the sweet flavors and wonderful mouth-feel. The performance at the end of this video is the you tube equivalent of the cherries at the end of my imagined sundae.

"You think the Darkness could also be applied to racist humor?  I tend to enjoy listening to racist humor, Asian humor in particular (partly because it means SOMEONE acknowledges that I exist, in the public space), from POC comedians and white comedians who've been thoroughly soaked in non-white neighborhoods and associations.  Many white people who complain about some double-standard of POC comedians being allowed to dunk on their own ethnic groups' Things as well as white people's Things don't seem to realize that the devil's in the details.  Minoritized-group members can tell if a comedian knows their shit, which is why more often than not they'll get a pass, maybe even considered 'one of us' as well.  They understand the details, they understand the impact marginalization by the dominant group does to affected group members, and self-deprecating humor is one of many coping tools for that.  'Good' racist humor, I feel, is someone's way of broadcasting, 'I've been there, I understand you, I feel your pain, I love you anyway, and I stand with you.'  Sympathy, curiosity, a desire for deeper understanding, love towards the vulnerable... that seems to be wholly lacking in the humor of edgelords.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm so glad you took down Gervais. That turd is too respected among people who love comedy. The joke of David Brent was that he was awful and no one should be that awful, but Gervais constantly shows that he is David Brent. I had an engagement with him on twitter where he spent an entire day shit posting me because he was bitching about how everyone else sucks (never himself) and I called him out, told he was a millionaire and should get off twitter and buy a boat. He then repeatedly offered to buy me a boat, which I outed myself as a poor person who lives in Flint, mi and that I'd much rather he donate to my city's water efforts. Rather than doing that, he continued to berate me, along with a bunch of his fans, and later deleted the majority of his own tweets from the conversation, but didn't block me. He literally cannot take a joke about himself, because he's an insecure turd human who would rather punch down.   He's David Brent.   Also, I appreciate how dark and honest you are, because it helped this cis white guy learn a lot more about transgender people than he ever has and always wanted to know, but was too afraid to ask for the reasons you stated in this video.

"That was a very long winded expose on how comedy is subjective. And because it is so subjective it is very difficult to access the morality of a comedy bit because the intint of a joke is the only portion of the joke which matters when talking about the morality of the joke because it's effect on people is to vast to be able to access on any moral dimension. So in short what makes a joke good or bad is the intent of the person telling it. Which is why 2 nazi guards telling a joke about the jews is a bad form of comedy and a liberal comic making the same joke today is good. The only diffrence is intent. Very interesting video made me think.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I would say don't be a dick. I'm a dick from time to time, but I don't feel proud about it. Humans have much more ways of expressing them-self, but just getting lazy. I like dark comedy, I like edgy jokes. But to me art should have a message. Carlin was edgy, he was telling us how we become a piece of shit of life's creation. He didn't say its cool to be like that. Ricky is just 'I want more and more money' fat fuck. People really don't get it. Yeah you can be an edge lord, telling around how you don't care about others feelings, but some day you may say a word too much to somebody who got so much bad shit in his/'her life, that he may answer the way that will fuck you up really badly. To me Ricky isn't an artist, he's just I need more money  junky, they're better ones. He's a capitalist, and capitalism teach: be selfish, it's good.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"When you mentioned the Ricky Gervais joke I immediately thought about a similar situation that happened to Dave Chappelle. He made a joke about Caitlyn Jenner doing a photoshoot for a magazine. One of his fans (a trans person) considered it offensive and wrote a letter to him. So during one of his Netflix specials, he decided to explain why he made the joke. He told a story (don't know if it's real or not) about an experience he had with a trans woman and the fact that she was afraid of him getting violent after finding out that she was trans. He talked for a bit and reflected on the joke about Jenner, then he came to the conclusion that the 'problem' are not trans people but his own prejudices against them. Then he says that even if he doesn't understand trans people very well he was sorry about hurting the feelings of one of his fans. Just compare this to Gervais' Netflix special, where instead of apologizing or reflecting on what he said, he decides to put down trans people even more by mocking them and defensively says that comedy is supposed to be offensive. The contrast between the reactions that the two comedians had really makes you understand why one of them is considered one of the best comedians of our times and the other is Ricky Gervais.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Saying shitty things about people simultaneously behind their back and on global media, for them to see,  is about as weak as it gets. But the acceptance, the ignorance, that is what ails us. Rage. Know that our true enemies do not have faces and no one is out to get us but us. I used to errantly call this Nihilism. Universal lack of intrinsic value is a good thing and there be no need of personification of my struggle. Punk rock, I enjoy metal as well. I have much to learn but what I see you going through is strangely not alien to me. My life has been isolation and I'm fairly sure I see you. I have, through use of a strict no-reality pragmatism I have overcome all but the how I can help others part. Which I am working on of course. Life without purpose is a prison. Taking away all pretense of supplied purpose through society, I am left seeking a niche and approximating. For an artist, this is no over night task.

"I do have a six degrees of separation chinese whispers connection with Ricky Gervais I guess. That works in the same way 'The Mouthfeel' has developed a life of it's own (to become friend or foe? - who know's) becoming it's own descrete being of consciousness flapping it's wings in the internet cosmos.   When I was a school kid in the UK. The slur of the time was to call everyone a 'Mongol' - this used to be the term the medical profession used to described people with 'down's syndrome'. But after a while of hearing people call you a mongol it starts to loose its impact - a yet you would still hear people saying it over and over again like a broken record. So me and a couple of friends took that feeling and applied it to the feeling of boredom and called it being 'monged'. Eventually, getting older, it applied to the 9 to 5 routine of working for a living. I moved cities. People in my new place were a bit confused as to what I meant when I came out with 'I feel monged' as they had never heard that expression before - so I had to explain it. Then weirdly, I started to hear people say it in different places from people who had no connection to me.   It seemed (whether from me I don't know?) that the term 'monged' had picked up around the UK - becoming associated with drug use of either taking so many substances that you became 'monged' or from just having over-done it thie night before. There was even a bloody movie made in Britain called 'Monged'. So in a way the term had lost it's connection as a slur to describe either people with down's syndrome or just people being bullied.   But then old Ricky Gervais shows up on twitter being an edge lord and using the term 'mong' in it's orginal meaning (to describe a 'stupid' person....  because Ricky Gervais has a galaxy brain of course) - creating a backlash...   And then later he would become the edge lord we all know and love when he started having a go at Caitlyn Jenner. I think the thing with Ricky Gervais is that he isn't actually joking. People laugh at him because he labels himself as a comedian.   The trouble with humour is that if you hear a joke enough times it stops having a funny impact and you just see it as normal. One could say this is what happens when you get older and forget about the irony and just say the same sh*t but stripped of humour - your tyrannical jibes are no longer a joke...   especially when you become currupted by power: you loose all sense of shame. Oh sh*t I have just been typing this while naked walking down the street with toilet roll trailing from my ass (who am I kidding - I can't afford a smart phone).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This video is so validating! I'm a NB queer bear, and because bear culture is traditionally a culture of gay men (though butch bears are a thing too), most of the men in my local bear club use words like 'brotherhood' very freely. I'm not a radical neopronoun NB (when misgendered my NB darkness is to tell people it's a soft he because the dick is silent), but I decided to start 'correcting' my fellow bears with 'personhood.' My local queer community now knows me as the crazy NB who regularly proclaims 'Bear personhood! Personhood to bears!'  I find it takes a lot of the toxicity out of discussion both inside the queer space and with the general public if I'm the one making jokes about the absurdity of being both NB and identifying with a masculine, traditionally cis gay expression of bear culture. I sometimes feel side eyed by my fellow NBs for doing this, but this video really validates the value in us queer folk honoring the nuance and and around our own experience, rather than having only outside voices poking fun at us.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Regarding the 'moralist' 'But is it funny' rebuttal: Being funny while sticking to those principles is a *lot* harder. A *lot* harder. A very talented comedian friend of mine calls it 'The gulf of sincerity' - if you can cross that gulf, you're an immortal icon. If you fall even a little bit short, though, everything sinks.  I think that's why the moralists have a better case to make. Because attempting to cross the sincerity gulf is so brutal, and doesn't have the immediate gratification that comes to the people who don't even try.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I have progressive hereditary hearing loss and I can definitely understand the unfunny overused joke bit... when I tell people they start saying 'what??' And cupping their ears like they can't hear. Most of the time my hearing loss isn't noticeable yet except when people mumble or talk quietly or if the background noise is bad. I don't really use humor to cope with it all that often since it's relatively mild for now. I do see other people make dumb unoriginal jokes about it a lot.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I was watching a video earlier about Dave Chappelle and his ability to 'dodge laser beams' in comedy(I'll include the link below). In the video, it is suggested that Chappelle avoids these moral dilemmas that result in contempt for him, because when he makes hurtful and harmful jokes, instead of doubling-down or apologizing, he 'owns it', turns inwards, and emerges like a phoenix, so that the joke then becomes his prejudice and bias(his darkness). Now, I am not sure if it is moral to do in the case of the transgender joke Chappelle made in the video(I am NOT trying to argue it is), but perhaps Chappelle is so beloved because of what Nat invites us to consider in this video.   Chappelle's response to the offense and harm his transgender joke caused could be something for Ricky to incorporate to progress his comedy. Ricky draws a clear distinction between the 'subject' of a joke, and the 'target'. If transgendered persons are the targets of his jokes rather than transgenderism simply being the subject of his jokes then he contradicts himself.   Thanking you for another insightful video. As always, a pleasure.  'How Dave Chappelle Dodges Laser Beams': URL","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"To be honest, I think that this video is talking about dark humour while missing a fundamental element of comedy. I don't think Ricky Gervais and George Carlin are attempting to present their views as any 'correct' way of thinking. Often times they are playing a character that serves as an example of our own dumb thoughts. Even if the joke doesn't contain a morally sound message, there is actually a moral purpose to expressing and exposing certain debates within society. It's the dialectic, sometimes the quickest way to answer a question is to present a false answer and be corrected.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I would argue that people who are ignorant towards certain topics, or really don't have any knowledge of them 'shouldn't' make jokes about them. They can of course but they are probably bad. But I would also argue that a 'woke' cis person can make good jokes about trans people. You don't need to experience something firsthand to have a 'good' opinion of it, the important part is that you can empathize. Of course you can also have an opinion of said topic If you are oblivious to it's nature, it just won't be a really 'good' or insightful one.   I really like you as an entertainer and person (as far as I can 'know' you trough your videos) and your content is some of the best on youtube, but I fear you are slowly taking sides. There was always a tendency, yes, but I also always felt you were very understanding of all the people involved. I hope you don't lose that and don't get into a 'us vs. them' mentality. This very emphatic but also challenging approach of you seemed to be your best asset. It helped me, a cis white male, to be more understanding of the LGBTQ community and all of it's offspring.

"I always understood that George Carlin bit on euphemisms not as 'yaaay you can totally still call disabled people cripples even though they asked countless times to please not do that', but as a criticism of the way we, as a society at large, are effectively more concerned with using the 'right' words than with ACTUALLY making deep changes in treatment of these issues, which in this case is how the disabled people are treated. It's similar to how hardcore homophobic and transphobic politicians are able to support and propagate lgbtq+ -extermination policies, but get away with it because they're using the correct words and not calling people fa***ts and tr***ies. That doesn't mean we should totally use horrible and insulting words for people, just that the system that cares more about the names we give to things and people than it cares about how these people and things are treated is a system that actively supports stagnation.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I used to really like comedy until I understood it was smarter, grown up, bully humor. The first one that caught my attention was because people protested it and I happened to see a report about the protest and that was the Nutty Professor by Eddie Murphy. Overweight people had a valid point, they were being bullied by Eddie Murphy and I laughed so hard that he made a sequel. I am not favor of those body acceptance people when 8 out of the top 10 Americans' deaths is because of food related illnesses but I know they must fight off awful people who tell them that they can't take a joke somehow. There's a difference of laughing at people and laughing with them.

"There are so many things about being trans that would make for excellent jokes. For example, I a few days ago a girl I went to school with sat down next to me on a bus. I recognized her immediately, but she didn't recognize me, since last time we met was two years ago when I still had giant boobs and no facial hair. So for the whole one hour drive I sat there, trying not to look at her too much, thinking: 'Does she know who I am? What if she tries to talk to me? Should I say anything?' She ended up not saying a word to me, we got off the bus eventually and when I was back home, I just couldn't stop laughing about how stressed I was for a whole hour, while she probably didn't even notice me. While I was on the bus, I was feeling like I could have a panic attack at any moment, but looking back, the situation seems so absurd, it's just hilarious. Another time I was at university, sitting in the cafeteria with my laptop out, which has a little trans flag sticker on it. A woman sitting on the opposite side of the table asked me what it was, I explained. She then got so furious, telling me I would never be a real woman. I listened, and when she was done I said: 'Yeah, you're right. I'm never gonna be a woman, because I'm a trans man.' She didn't even know such a thing exists.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As usual, a fantastic video (no surprises there!)...  I would have liked to have heard the rest of the song...it's always a good song (because it is simultaneously so earnest and yet so hokey with several decades of distance from its original writing), but I also really enjoy listening to you sing, and this version was that great tightrope walk of self-parody and earnestness.  And, like all explanations of jokes, that makes it less funny and less effective, but it wasn't just funny to hear you sing it, it was also just fun...and I like funny, I like fun, I want to live in a hamburger bun, etc.  Also:  the self-deprecating humor of a lot of British comedians does that tightrope walk well, without going into the humiliation that Hannah Gadsby discusses, I think.  Some do it better than others, but on the whole Britain and Ireland do it pretty well...with huge exceptions like the Dicknugget you mentioned herein.  (Have you seen his children's books?

"Some say the secret to comedy is timing. I disagree. The key to comedy is the connection with you audience. It's why people laugh more easily with their friends. It's why comedians on a stage have an easier time making people laugh when the audience is already expecting jokes. It's why a comedian is often wise to degrade themselves BEFORE jokingly degrading their audience... And it's why comedians can get away with jokingly, but sincerely, mocking people who are either not in the audience or who make up a minority of the audience... In other words, a successful comedian needs to have firm control over their audience. A good comedian is apt at establishing a connection with their audience almost no matter what.    When you tell a joke on twitter, you need to be mindful of the fact that your 240 characters aren't just said to your followers. For public profiles that can be retweeted, your jokes are said to EVERYONE and you only have 240 characters, your name and a profile pic to make both a connection with everyone who might read it and fit in the joke itself.  Dark comedy and twitter doesn't really mix well UNLESS your name and profile pic alone can establish a connection usually because you're famous and your ideals are commonly known.    I need to stop myself before I go on for too long, so I sadly only managed to touch upon how audience connection relates to twitter. I want people to consider how it relates to comedy clubs, how it relates to taking things out of context and how it relates  to potential or lack of minorities in an audience. There are also a few assholes that I want to to consider the flawed logic behind saying 'This was said to make (some) people laugh. Jokes are meant to make people laugh. Jokes (sometimes) aren't meant to be taken seriously or at face value. Ergo, you just didn't get the joke if you took it at face value' when such a thing as sincere mockery exist. 'It was a joke!',  you say with truth, but what kind of joke?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Interesting. This actually reminds me of my own various apologia for Jerry Sadowicz, the original and still by far the best dark edge-lord comedian, but articulated in a much better and much more concrete than my rants. Good to know we're on the same page tho.   As a citizen of the occupied six counties of northern Ireland who lived through the end of the troubles I can't emphasise enough how good and how necessary 'the darkness' is for a people under siege. But where I'm from we've walked the walk, seeing Yank and Brit comedians brought up in their fucking safe suburban spaces trying to do it is cringe more than half the time, like there's a reason why we're the funniest people in the world and why our humour by and large doesn't travel well (though Derry Girls does come close, its delightful, watch it). But you're not hardcore unless you live hardcore, they don't we do, Ricky Gervaise definitely hasn't for a while. Ricky was always a dubious prospect, The Office is a work of genius, Extras is again a work of genius but those are about the grinding dullness of middle England and someone not famous engaging with celebrity culture, two things from which he has a deep vein of experience to draw from which he spins into gold. Everything else is a bit hit or miss, which again is telling.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Comedy is fondamentaly a rational incomprehension of something. There are certain conditions in which this incomprehension is made, but it is important that it is incomprehension. This is true for both 'comedy' and 'the darkness' (and it does exist a technical word for it, Pirandello called it humorism). The reason why Gervais joke doesn't make you laugh is that you comprehend what lies behind the joke. You not being in a state of ignorance is exactly why you don't laugh. Thr darkness, humor, is the capacity to temporarily misunderstanding yourself, and laugh about you. It is a very very refined form of comedy, it is very good but also a lot more subjective because you need empathy with the humored person. And you still need incomprehension","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Basically, dark humor is about creating a connection through shared weakness, while edgy humor is about making your audience feel like they were better than someone else. Humor is only good when it's lived Anarchy, when it erases hierarchies to bring everyone to the same level and subverts categories to show connections between things we want to keep separate.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Wonderful video! I can't even begin to go over all the ways this video gets this topic so right and how it feels like you took my own opinions right out of my head. I have been so fed up with how toxic the edgy people and comedy police have gotten. I believe dark humor is very important and I think George Carlin overall is a great example of someone who was super edgy but always had a progressive very well meaning point. But sadly in todays world Carlin would be hated by many pc leftist before they even could realize that his jokes actually punch at authoritarian conservatives more then anything. And hey its not to say that you can't critique Carlin, I think your critique of his joke there was very well done and showed very clearly how to balance correct terminology against political correctness. I just wish the left had someone like Carlin today, because while I believe a lot of the more pc people have the best intentions I fear they are actually just trying to hide all the dark shit out their, but that isn't going to change peoples hearts or minds.   And then of course the flip side of things is that honestly I think a lot of comedians don't realize that while they may know that they are joking, their audience might not. So some comedian who lets say makes sexist jokes may believe the jokes to be so ridiculous that surely no one actually would believe this is ok, but no sadly most in the audience may take it as gospel depending on their own background. Then of course there is the situation where someone who is progressive may make a joke that doesn't go over well and is then stormed by the twitter mobs and then they get a bunch of alt right shit lords trying to come to their defense just to use the situation as a political wedge. So then a well meaning progressive who may have just said something dumb is in a shit storm trying to get the twitter mob off of them while also trying to get freaking nazis to stop defending them. Its the same thing to for critiquing fundamentalism in religion. Right wingers will often complain about, why left wingers no critique radical islam, their say? Well ideally I want all fundamentalist parts of any religion or political believe critiqued, but I don't want to give ammo to a bunch of nazis and white nationalist who are going to take those criticism and propagate their own xenophobic hate with it against the entirety of a religion.

"Okay, so I'm autistic, and i can definitely understand what the darkness is. Having to be reduced to a joke or meme at best, and an insult at worst, just to get people to acknowledge that you even exist in the first place. I tend to joke more about the other end of the discussion, though: the anti-vaxers using me as an argument like I don't exist, people trying to deny my help that I need to actually function, people generally seeing me as lesser somehow, etc. You know the type: xenophobia to a level where you wonder how they even function in daily life. I want to get a point across about how wrong that kind of treatment of any person is. But raging is going to make every other autistic person they meet after me look bad. And that goes directly against my principles. Not to mention that it's definitely not getting me that basic respect that I'm always after. So what do you do to discredit these people? Make THEM the butt of the joke for a change.   For example: if someone uses autism as an insult, I find that childish and I want to voice that. So I joke about the other person having to be 12 years old. The joke gets a chuckle out of the neurotypical folks, and gets my point across just as well: I'm nobody's insult. A well placed 'Now that's not a nice thing to say, little Billy' after mentioning that I find it childish also takes away from the heavy atmosphere that the subject just naturally has. And that makes the discussion just a bit more accessible for people who maybe want to agree with me, but are scared that they're invading a safe space by speaking up. Neurotypical folks telling others that behavior like that is wrong, is exactly what I want to see more of. So a joke lets them know: 'Hey, you're not crazy for thinking that, and it's okay to tell these people that they're being stupid, '.   Also, as someone in the goth subculture... Natalie's goth look was really good, clearly she did her research before she made it. Now this is how you joke about a group of people that you're not in. I feel like part of the joke, not the butt of it. Most people can't be arsed to even Google 'goth makeup' before 'going goth' for one video. They just throw on one of those horrid Crow makeup looks, 'joke' about all of us having clinical depression for 15 minutes but they're actually testing the waters, and call it a day. That joke stopped being funny around the 80's, when the subculture originated. They need to get some new material already. The tear eye look is clearly not what an actual goth would wear, yet good enough to know that she did enough research to actually try to be relatable for the subculture. That, plus the lack of goth jokes, is why I feel included instead of the butt of the joke. Really refreshing, can other people copy this style of poking fun at us? Genuinely wondering where you got that choker, though... I have a bracelet that would match it perfectly. No lie, it's actually lying on my desk right now. xD","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It's always weirded me out how my making jokes about my health actually offends people who don't have the condition.  I think my favorite specific instance of me making a dark epilepsy joke was when my seizures were dangerously uncontrolled because of circumstances out of my hands, but I still had obligations at uni. I was having multiple seizures per day - on bad days over 20 per day. When a perky, smiling young woman from the Health Center outreach was on the quad asking people their favorite forms of exercise were, I knew what I had to do. I wrote 'uncontroled epilepsy' on the whiteboard with the straightest of faces and watched the as the perk drained from her face in an instant. It was truely, to me, the height of comedy.  And then I had to explain how I was actually very sick and not just an edgelord. And also that the seizures were giving me great abs.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

And on the other hand: none of the terrible people doing shit so far had brain damage. Maybe brain damage makes good people!'  That is one of the examples for my inner darkness.  The thing with the darkness is: not only people inside minorites have that and some people cant embrance their own darkness so they turn against others.

"So, as my first/second YouTube comment, I just wanna say that Natalie, almost everything you do is golden. You have the Midas touch in terms of content creation. I do have a few things I was hoping to discuss with folks in the comments section though, being someone of nowhere near complete knowledge. For one thing, would having a complete agreement on what's right and morally correct make comedy more good? I heard you make this statement and thought, 'Well, if comedy is about tension between right and wrong, then wouldn't the absolute knowledge of rightness really kill the buzz of a joke that centers around moral ambiguity?' Also, your comment on 'trans women being delusional men' and how that is an ignorant conception, seems in itself a tad misinformed. And I am not saying this as a trans person, I am saying this as someone who studies, among other things, the relations between culture and sexuality. The act of transitioning from one gender into another is a result of having gender dysphoria, a strong discomfort with the biological actuality of one's previous biological gender traits. Gender dysphoria is, in fact, a diagnosable mental condition. It's even in the DSM-5; it was once called gender identity disorder, but they removed the disorder part for obvious reasons. What I'm trying to get at is, rather than telling folks that people who transition or go through any number of treatments are simply people who are not of the mind to be a certain gender, we should try and reinforce the idea that this distress comes from psychological and biological sources, not to offend people of any nature, but to help further the understanding of this touchy subject. I'm schizophrenic, and recovering, and treating this sickness in a scientific and rational way is undoubtedly helping me more than treating it as some Eldritch or otherwise spiritual damage to my soul. Just my thoughts. Thank you so much for doing everything you do.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Every joke is blown just a little bit out of proportions; thats what makes us laugh about our ways of taking ourselves and our particular brand of narcissism too serious.   Jokes make you disassociate from the (sometimes to narrow minded) identification with whatever current personal problem is made fun of and reminds us that we are all relatable in our delusions and therefore able to feel compassion.   Every phase and form of transition has some painful physical or emotional suffering involved. Sometimes we choose our transition, sometimes it is just forced upon us. Jokes play on that and make it bearable. The offense taken even shows us how we are still narcisstically stuck in our lives and offers a choice out of it to a certain degree by laughing it smaller, so to speak...  Toughen up, would be my suggestion, but stay soft in your heart. Just take it and work with it to grow.

As you said the details are essential when it comes to comedic effect, but really is it how relatable the experience is; as a transperson you can relate to the spermbank story, but Ricky Gervais's 'ignorance' of transpeople is more widely relatable to the general public. Freedom of expression is key, the joke might be campy but the crowd laughed; I hope we can all realize that comedy is subjective and that these calls for censorship are misguided, and a dark symptom of our society's well being.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Your distinction between 'edge' and 'dark' is similar to where I think of the distinction between 'upsetting' and 'offensive' being. 'Upset' is a feeling and its sources can be very subjective. 'Offense' is a situation, one that's not affected by how I feel about it, and its sources are a little more easy to define.    Basically I think of 'offense' as when someone takes something that's rightly mine. If someone tells jokes that encourage society  to treat me like I'm subhuman, they're taking something that is, if not directly measurable, then at least quantifiable in terms of my safety and access and prospects. 'Upset' is an emotional feeling of discomfort or unease around something that is jarring or foreign or hurtful. You can be offended without being upset, you can be upset without anything offensive having happened, or you can be both, but managing my sense of upset doesn't change whether a thing is offensive. If someone steals five bucks out of my pocket, I'm still out five bucks even if I laugh it off. My sunny disposition isn't going to help me buy my big frothy liberal latte. When people make gross shitty sexist jokes, it doesn't upset me, it doesn't send me crying to the bathroom, like everyone assumes when the word 'offended' typically gets deployed, I just mean they're taking from me things that are rightfully mine. Lots of people do like to try and make a federal case that their subjective sense of upset is actually an offense, but they're wrong and should just bake the gay wedding cake already.   Which is what I really like about your point about using *your own* darkness to make 'edgy' jokes. Because culture has a leading edge and a trailing edge. When you're transforming your own pain, your own wisdom and experience, into twisted humor, you're not stealing from someone else, you're using something that is uniquely your own, and you're pushing forward past the edge of what's currently known. You're making growth and sharing it. In that sense, the leading edge is just as capable of upsetting people as the trailing edge, but it's far less likely to genuinely offend.

"Kafka is the darkness.  David Foster Wallace is the darkness.  Once thing I will say, though, is while I agree with what you're saying, which seems to be essentially: 'write what you know.'  The catch is that artists then only end up writing what they know.  So while I do love the works of Kafka and Wallace, mostly for how deeply and darkly, tragically comedic they are, neither author really makes any attempt to include any experience or perspective other than their own.  Maybe this isn't a bad thing, though.  Maybe we don't actually need authors to try to express experiences that aren't their own, maybe I just need to put in the effort to seek out more diverse authors.

"Bo Burnham balances both snowflakery and edginess imho  What separates him from edgy comics is the fact that these edgy comics make bits based on theit own reactionary views and guise them under 'jokes' like Bill Burr and Joe Rogan, etc. Bo Burnham avoids that by using an obvious onstage persona who relies on puns and lyricism rather than messaging or truth telling. Bo expresses no opinion on his edgy bits and when he does express an opinion thru sincere songs like God's Perspective or Rant, it doesnt punch down.  There is an interview too where Bo is asked abt SJWs getting offended and he said the exact same thing Contra did in the video...that he believes ppl can speak up if theyre offended cuz its their right.  Anyway his song New Math still holds up imho at least cuz he uses controversial topics to make a catchy song about math rather than send a message or make a statement. There is no inaccuracy to be pointed out. The whole song is clever in its wordplays and theme.  Stan Bo Burnham hahaha","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"it doesn't matter if you make a dark or offensive joke; what matters is the perspective or statement that is implied by making such a joke. 'i identify as a chimp don't call me anything else' is a joke that implies that anyone who identifies as anything other than the physical body they were born in is just being silly, which is pretty offensive to trans people. however a joke about being trans and struggling with the hardships that come with it is not nearly as offensive, because all that is implied is that trans people struggle and let me say as a trans person that is true so .... not really any harm done. people often overlook the message behind a joke bc 'oh its just a joke don't take it seriously'. and why pray tell can't i take it seriously? pretty sure the MEANING BEHIND the joke IS serious, and is actually very important. jokes can be a nice way to disguise your nasty beliefs and get away with being offensive bc 'its just a joke' but we all know that behind every attack helicopter joke is even the tiniest bit of transphobia, and THAT is offensive, not neccesarily the joke itself. get your head out of your ass and stop making excuses for having offensive or shitty beliefs. if you don't like trans people stop hiding behind jokes and just say it. its so obvious what you are doing. obviously sometimes its silly for people to get offended over something if what was implied was not offensive, for instance, sarcastic jokes poking fun at racism itself but that aren't actually in themselves racist but rather anti-racist. i swear sarcastic jokes are always the most misunderstood by idiots. obviously its silly if someone was offended by things that are obviously sarcastic (two good examples are Pewdiepie and Eminem, just two examples of kings of irony who should not be taken literally) but when you say 'i'm a chimp don't call me anything else blehh' the sarcasm is directed towards trans people, not transphobia. you were being transphobic and its very clear that just like if you look at the meaning behind for instance the lyrics of an Eminem song and find that the message is actually quite good, if you look behind this joke all that can be taken out of it is 'trans people are being stupid' and THAT is offensive. obviously just because people are sometimes silly and overly offended doesn't mean they always are. get your head out of your ass and stop making excuses and own up to what you really believe and what you really mean already, instead of just being offensive and pretending that it being a joke automatically makes it not offensive or ok. if i paint myself in blackface and act like a monkey i'm being offensive wether its a joke or not, and black people who get offended by it aren't sensitive snowflakes, they have a right to be offended by that. same goes for attack helicopter jokes. every joke has a meaning behind it and that meaning is actually what partly gives the joke its humor if people can relate to it or feel a sense of relief from it, but of course only if they relate to it. the meaning behind jokes about people's own depression is essentially 'look you're not alone lots of people go through this shit its ok' and while the joke is dark that implied meaning is very comforting. the only implied meaning behind attack helicopter-esc jokes is so that transphobic people can all laugh at trans people and get a sense of relief that they aren't the only ones who in their confusion think we are 'being silly'. trans people shouldn't be expected to find that funny. no one is being overly sensitive when your implied message was clearly very offensive so please for the love of god just shut the fuck up you absolute asshole. WHAT MATTERS IS NOT THE FACT YOU MADE A JOKE ABOUT SOMETHING BUT WHAT THE JOKE _MEANT_ . DUHHHHHH  Natalie makes jokes about trans people, but the meaing is very supportive and positive. the 'mouth feel' joke stemmed from a VERY good argument explaining how straight trans women ARE women, not gay men dressed as women. attack helicopter jokes again only imply trans people are being silly. cmon now people use your brains. think about what the actual point and purpose of a joke is. what did you learn in high school in literature class? what is the author (comedian) _really_ saying?  sorry this is just something i keep thinking and it feels nice to just say it","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Embracing the Darkness is the reason why Euripides is my favorite (funny) tragedian. Sophocles is too dry, Aeschylus is too noble. Euripides' empathy for the marginalized groups of his time and understanding of the best and worst parts of human nature sets him apart. Only Euripides can make you sympathize with Medea even while she's committing mass murder (including that of her own children), or consider Pentheus' fate of being torn apart by maeneds and Agave's of murdering her son as a kind of just comeuppance. Black comedy is so personal. If an example of it speaks to you, you love it. If it doesn't, you'll either hate it, or just not get why someone else is laughing hysterically next to you. I'm an old skool board brat with a taste for edgier fare, so I'm usually pretty tolerant of comedy that walks on the wild side. As long as it's actually funny. It's hard to make fun of something without understanding it. Or at least hard to do it well.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You might have outdone the Incels video with this one. Great job, legitimately a well-rounded look at the subject.  I think someone like Gervais lives in a different sort of world to you. You're very cognizant of the social ramifications of the things you say, and while that's a good aspiration to have, it's not the only valid way to exist. Sometimes punching down is so funny, and laughing at other people you don't really understand feels so good, and I don't like to deny that kind of thing just because there's some potential for harm there for those who can't separate jokes from reality.   But for that particular joke, you're right that it's poorly thought out, not really funny or insightful. It does, however, point to a missing link of sorts, between his (and his audience's) understanding of trans people and the reality. They don't see the line of what's acceptable to change yourself to as ending at gender. For them, the concern is that people want to be trans-race and trans-age (and trans-species... why not? I'm a furry after all, and if the medical transition to raccoon ever hits the market I'm on board), and they can't find the logical disconnect from transgender to that.  So the laughs are coming from a place of 'yeah, those guys are weirdos and you totally just owned them' as well as a comfort in seeing someone with a fairly substantial reach come out and say that. Say what you will about the state of the public view of trans people, it's DEFINITELY not socially acceptable to be transphobic these days. So it must be comforting to see someone still has the 'backbone' to come out and joke like that.  It feels weird to say, but being offended is fun. On some level, I crave a little negative attention, and looking at the state of some online games I don't think I'm alone in that. People like to argue, to insult each other, to get all heated and angry. It's in our nature, and if we get too soft on each other for fear that someone's going to stumble into our little pillow fight with a skull made out of eggshells, we end up caging that negativity up inside and it comes out in some really dark and sinister forms. I never want to hurt someone, but sometimes I just want to open up the floodgates of mean-ness a bit. And I don't want people to stop feeling like they can snipe me. Go ahead.

"Okay, it makes sense to me. I'm so very cis, I'm pretty good at writing jokes, and I can't, for the life of me, come up with a funny trans joke. Every time I try, the joke turns out to be about my reaction to a trans person. That's not a trans joke, it's a cis joke. Example: I was introduced to a trans woman, but no one had told me her name. I knew her 'dead name,' but not her live name (is that right? 'live name?' I'm...no...good...at...this.) So I said, 'Pleased to meet you, Ms. Smith.'

"I personally lean more towards the 'shitposting' end of the rope. That doesn't mean that I'd tell transphobic jokes around a trans person, that's just basic social responsibility (aka not being a dick). But on the internet or in any form of expression like a stand up comedy, freedom of expression is something very important to me.  You have the right to say whatever the fuck you want and people have the right to get upset about it.    The problem arrives when people who get offended resort to censorship. This might seem ok when someone you don't like gets banned everywhere, like Alex Jones. But that's slippery slope; and over the years society has become so PC and sensitive that anyone can be censored, sometimes for dark humor, other times just for disagreeing on a controversial topic. And don't even get me started when things are twisted to be offensive.. anything can be sexist, racist, or nazi. It's all about how you view it.  I have hope that society one day realizes that  *T h e  D a r k n e s s*  is just a part of the human nature and we can move on and focus on more important issues, like war, poverty, inequality, climate change... y'know, those pesty little fellows.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm not a fan of embarrassment humour so by his own  yardstick I find a lot of Ricky's jokes offensive. But when someone in a position of power starts to make jokes about a minority then that's less about laughing with them and more about laughing at them. Should comedians make edgy jokes? Yes. That's kind of what they should do. Good comedians don't just make you laugh but they should shine some light on serious matters.  A good example for me is the brilliant comedienne Liz Miele. She's dyslexic, as am I, and in a talk about the condition she said 'I can spell museums ten different ways, you can do only one, now who's not trying.' Any undiagnosed dyslexic, and many  who have, will have heard the words your not trying. As Natalie rightly states, the humour is in the details.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The problem with his work, as I see it, is that when he shits on a particular group of people, it generally relies on the 'funny because true' setup. This blurries the lines of what are really 'just joking' and what are actual beliefs, and easily reaffirms the confirmation bias of the kinds of people who harm, belittle or oppress the ones who are the punchline. He needs to get off the persecution complex high horse though. People get away with offensive jokes all the time. The reason he's not, is mostly because they're just not funny enough.

"Sometimes people ask if it's okay to joke about suicide, and the reason that most of the time it is is that usually it comes from that peak Darkness place. In Olly's video about suicide and mental health (you know the one) there's one moment where he cracks a joke about how the knife he used to self-harm with also has a fork and spoon attached. It's a weird moment, because it feels too dark to laugh at - he says 'I give you permission to laugh,' because he's pretty self-aware, but there's a part of me that thinks 'but it really isn't so funny' when I think about it for longer than a half second. It strikes too deeply and hits too close to home for me to be able to laugh. Like the Darkness is tied to 'willing suspension of disbelief,' where it's only funny if you don't think too hard, otherwise it's incredibly sad. but it's still something I can respect, even if it doesn't make me laugh - it's genuine, it's trying to find strength out of pain. some dicknugget making fun of suicidal teens would be decidedly less respectable because it's not at all genuine. the same is true about trans jokes. I'd love to see a bit about a trans man going to the gynecologist and receiving hushed, confused stares in the waiting room. I'd love to hear about never finding shoes or clothes that fit. I'd even love to hear about crying in the shower because I have to look at a body I hate just long enough to clean it. those jokes would be genuine, even if that last one would be a bit too close to home to be funny.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

For example: the phrase 'African American'  is being pushed instead of 'Black'. 'Black' is more accurate because not all Africans are black (e.g. Dutch and Arabs) and an nationality followed by the word 'American' usually only refers to first or second generation immigrants.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I would wonder why you think you're not passing perfectly, but I can't even listen to my own voice (I'm cis, it just sounds too weird), and anything I write or act out sounds worse to me than it does to anyone else.

"I think you could also consider that Gervais's chimp joke is not a joke about trans people, but a joke about the beliefs of transphobic people, many of whom will be in the audience unwittingly laughing at themselves. Or he could just be a jerk that doesn't understand enough about the topic, and is simply playing on the widespread ignorance found in abundance in our societies. Either way, he's playing to his audience, which means whether his ideas are right or wrong, he's at least good at his job.  Also, contributing sperm to make a baby would make you the father, not the mother. Procreation is a function of sex, not gender.

"The only problem with Sound of Silence is now it's so memed that I hear 'Hello silence my old friend' and I'm just like. 'OK I can't take this seriously any more'  I honestly didn't find Gervais' joke about Caitlyn that bad. (I'm also trans so I'm just gonna cockblock that argument). If he didn't deadname her I'd have been like 'shit dude, she sure did, for the better I hope.' [EDIT: I also didn't find it funny, just not egregious. I've heard far worse.]   Anyway, my favourite trans thing to joke about which (most) cis people will never understand is my irrational fear of losing my nipples. It haunts me constantly. There's an obsession at this point to checking my nipples haven't popped off in the night like a plaster that's lost its stick.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"There's a lot of great ideas in here, but I can't help but feel there's been something crucial omitted from this analysis. If good edgy comedy needs the comedian to be speaking well enough about 'their' darkness, then in fact we can only find people who are relatively similar to ourselves as truly funny. Like, it's easy to say that comedians will always have home field advantage when talking about themselves. But when do they get to choose any topic that isn't their own experience? I see this resulting in edgy comedians being forever relegated to small ingroups where their material is sensitive but sequestered. AKA Youtube channels. And anyone whose brand is edgy and must expand outside of their own experience/identity will be shot down immediately. Shouldn't we try to prevent that in the name of variety?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"But i like more the idea of every one of us being in  different fires at once; there are people in the same fire as you but also conected to different ones, some hotter than others, but we all are burning to death. You can make jokes about other fires, because variety -even in perspectives of life- is great; the problem comes when you don't have enough knolage of something and you try to make a joke about it anyways, you might fuck it up. Also, if it is a little too rude, like when it crusses some imaginary  limit, (different for everyone but there is an average, because there is always an average), it will make the fire a little bigger, for just the people within that limit that you've reached. I do have an opinion, but this is just an analogy trying to be factual, since, as an example, the regions in the brain that are activated when you get phisically hurted and insulted are the same.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"To the Dark Lady: Thank you for sharing the song at the end, Natalie, sounding wonderful!   To everyone else: The most succinct definition of comedy I ever received was 'Talking about the weird shit that happened to you.' Sure, jokes exist, but the funniest things will always come from relaying a personal take. I'm reminded of the time that a former partner got mad at me for implying abuse jokes could be funny. As an abuse survivor, I use those sort of jokes to cope, but had failed at the idea of 'social responsibility.' A very key point is touched on there. While I may be comfortable and need those sort of things to continue coping, as Natalie and her Edge Ladies do (if my understanding is correct, admittedly), to do so can undermine legitimacy that others are trying to get. Maybe my partner was right, but I know that I felt like she was attacking me for being a victim, rather than for hurting less fortunate victims, and I realize now that was my privilege speaking.   I just figured I'd share, so maybe someone else with a similar experience can finally put it into words.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Certain parts seemed to overcomplicate what's really going on. There will always be conflict and otherizing I don't know that you can stop that. To me being 'edgy' is about not giving a fuck what other people think of you or better term 'hardcore'. It's not people like Natalie I'd say are the 'snowflakes', it's people who walk around and expect entitlement because they're 'unique' when that is what we all are and makes us individuals. Ultimately though there are people who are trying to censor others based on polarizing political perspectives, this has very little to do with comedy. The PMRC failed back in the 80's it will fail again as it pisses on the very feet of those who tout it off, better term 'moral busy bodies'. Left to the most extreme of my views I would be an anarchist, but then I grew up and realized that idea would be terrible. Now I just want to see as much freedom as we can muster. Natalie has a good example in this very video when she says 'others have the right to post it and I have the right to make fun of it'. Where's the point where we agree to disagree and still share a drink or a bowl of good nug together though?   Anyways, on the darkness thing, I'm dark but not for the same reasons, I live for melancholy. I view the world as one long story written by Edgar Allen Poe. There are no protagonists and no antagonists as they are all one in the same. The world is just dark calculating and cruel and I like it. For those who live in heaven know nothing of hell. For every scar on my body, every stain on my memory is a reminder of all the joyous delightful things in life I take for granted. Kiss death and I promise you watching a sunrise; you'll not ever remember it as being so beautiful before.  Without knowing pain one would have no guage to ponder what is pleasure. The more turmoil you find, the more things you took for granted become beautiful.   At the same time though when everything is just as it seems. You catch yourself staring into the abyss and longing for death. Succumb by numbness and boredom. The inability to rationalize your own exsistace. Sometimes the pain reminds you that you're real and can in fact still feel. Not that you have longed to feel nothing, in fact you miss feeling something to the desperation of looking for sadness and pain just to feel something at all. You long for the innocence you once had before staring into the abyss, when you felt you could feel something other then lost and of all desperations. Like a mere drop of water upon your tongue in a dry arid place, enough to keep you alive yet unsatisfied, you're left only forever longing for more. That is the darkness when nothing moves you anymore.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This was very interesting and gave me a new perspective on comedy: as a struggle between extremes. In one, there maybe pure edginess, where the only objective is to make someone laugh and morality be damned. And in the other, pure motality without anything that might make someone laugh.  I also enjoyed how you never said that gervais (I have no idea on how to spell his name) should not be allowed to say edgy jokes or some other trite blather. Instead, you critiqued him, along with jokes of that nature. I find that admirable. The issue never turned to one of free speech, but one of social responsibility. Yes, Gervais did say a misinformed joke. But never allowing anyone to say such jokes is ludicrous, critiquing them and informing the audience is better tactic, in my mind.  Anyways, that's what I took from it. And keep up the good, thought-provoking work, Natalie.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'any self-deprecation is a form of internalized bigotry' omg this. the thing is, most people who have been 'on the margins' long enough to be introspective often know that their dealing with internalized bigotry. i, like most teenage girls, went through a phase of major competitive internalized misogyny when i was in middle school. i still deal with a lot of internalized biphobia and ableism in my daily life, because the negative stereotypes and narratives that help create internalized bigotry are always gonna be around. but instead of being able to talk about those things, to have nuanced thoughts and opinions, you run the risk of getting accused of having internalized bigotry as if you've never thought about it before. safe spaces are incredibly important and serve a purpose, but not when it gets to the point that you can't have honest conversations about your own life experiences (or even something as trivial as shipping preferences between fictional characters), without someone on the internet you don't know making high and mighty assumptions about very personal aspects of your life.  also, i do find it very ironic that 'the sound of silence' is essentially a social call to action that distinctly *warns against* edgelord nihilistic apathy, but that every internet edgelord loves lol. it's like that time reagan used 'born in the usa' by bruce springsteen on his campaign without actually listening to the lyrics.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I think though the important thing about being able to 'laugh at being on fire' is the fact that it kind of allows you to trivialize the worst parts of your life and say that you're okay. It's even better when people laugh with you from the same place of understanding - kind of a collective flipping those horrible things off.

"I dunno, I think there's an entire aspect of comedy you are neglecting, that being the performative aspect. Comedy doesn't necessarily need to speak truth to power, make light of 'the darkness' or really achieve any other goal to be art. Because it already is. Like with any painting, song, play, etc the format in which it is displayed/performed is simply the medium of expression. It's kind of like saying that unless a song is structured like 'X' or covers topic 'Y' that it can't be art yet. It's kind of partly missing the point.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's like when Americans try to make fun of the accents of people from other countries, like Canada. Bob and Doug McKenzie were both played by Canadian actors poking fun at their own culture, and when you've lived around that culture you're far better at poking fun at it in a way people like you will relate to. It's designed to make light of your own world, to playfully poke fun at something everyone the joke is intended for understands, has lived through, and finds joy in laughing at. It's comedy that, in a sense is designed to bring people together over their own experiences. Jokes made by cis people about trans people, on the other hand, are fundamentally different. If my previous example of Canadians joking about Canadian stereotypes are a playful nod to life experiences many Canadians can relate to, a sort of coming together to laugh at themselves as a group, jokes by cis people about trans people are designed to make something strange that they can't understand into a sort of 'other' that they can laugh at as a form of criticism. It's designed to bring people together to collectively stigmatize something as weird. It's the difference between a disabled kid making jokes about getting around in a wheelchair to his friends, vs. a bunch of dicknuggets mocking him for being in a wheelchair. One comes from a place of understanding, empathy and shared pain, the other from prejudice and a desire to make yourself feel well-adjusted and normal. The same sorta place Jerry Springer or TLC shows come from. 'At least I'm not like THOSE weirdos.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"What people laugh at tells you something about what they're surprised by and what seems contradictory or absurd to them. All jokes are 'in jokes' in the sense that in order for both the teller and audience to find them funny they need to share some experience, opinion, or motivation. The more you share, the funnier any given joke can be. There are certain things that we all share, like being in imperfect human bodies, which is why we all like slapstick just a bit. Other things many of us share, like language, so plays on words are generally funny (so long as they're not too easy). While social expectations are wide and varied from group to group, we all have similar expectations about how a person hosting something like the Oscars is going to behave, and other expectations about how Ricky Gervais is going to behave. Sometimes the tension between two conflicting expectations is the perfect petri dish for comedy.   To find his jokes about trans people funny you need to share his lack of experience with, understanding of, and/or empathy for trans people. I might have snorted at the Oscars joke because in the context of the Caitlin Jenner media mania of the time and the fact that Ricky Gervais was hosting a major media awards show on a fairly conservative mainstream platform, the joke caught me off guard and the absurdity of letting a mother fucker who will definitely say shit like that host this show was immediately apparent. Then I felt bad.   His 17 minute Netflix hitjob on trans people wasn't funny to me because I didn't share his ignorance. It's funny to people who share the experience of feeling like trans people are crazy and feeling like the world has gone crazy for calling you an asshole for pointing out how crazy they are. It's funny to people whose understanding of gender is one of a fixed biological construct. To these people trans people are absurd in the most literal sense.. I don't even know if they can help it. That's why channels like this are so important. People can't choose what experience they're exposed to but the more experiences with trans people, gay people, people of other races, disabled people, etc., that a person has the less likely they are to be the kind of person who finds something funny out of pure ignorance.  Much love Natalie.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Before watching this I want to say I think you gave up/are giving up a great male body for a female one and why? To put it bluntly because you're delusional. No matter what you might think, no matter how hard you think you're right, believing you're somehow in the wrong body and therefore need to mutilate yourself is never the correct answer. It's insanity. This is obviously a mental issue which requires a mental solution - one that can never be solved through physical means. I hope that one day there will be a medication you can take so you fit into your body but with the current political climate funding isn't exactly easy and one's reputation and career would be in tatters... To end things on a brighter note, I think you're a fantastic entertainer and incredibly smart.

"My own personal opinion, comedy is for making people laugh. Just the natural point of hysteria. In most of these cases, with people being edgelords (or edgeladies), is that even the case? Several times during this video, I had an involuntary response. A pure laugh. It wasn't based on politics or opinion. It was just this physical reaction, like a tick. This, I feel, was the real thing. Something I agree, comes from 'the darkness' as you describe it. But when someone is amused by some kind of bad edgePERSON comedy, you have to ask yourself.. is this laugh natural in that same way, or some kind of indignant response? Is this reaction authentically involuntary, or elation manifested from a validation of one's questionable beliefs.  For a frame of reference, I would suggest looking up the banal political humor of someone like Dennis Miller during his run with his self-titled show on CNBC. He delivered pro-Bush commentary to a room full of uptight older white cis-men all in suits with flag pins (classic GOP uniforms) who were looking for someone to agree with so they could decompress. These laughs weren't a genuine reaction to something universally humorous. They were a sigh of relief over being validated by what was objectively a poor attempt at humor. I can't speak for anyone else, but see a huge difference between the two. One worth pointing out IMHO.  Love the new video, Natalie!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I tend to avoid shows like It's always sunny because I don't want to be reminded of 'the darkness.' Life is already painful enough and in confronting those kinds of things even through laughter there is always the subtle undertone of suffering that I have to live with day to day. Sure comedy can remind us of those things, but just as in the simplicity of aesthetic pleasure, it can also show us the best of life, friendship, love, kindness etc. All comedy may be derived from misfortune but the aims of such comedy are always up to the individual to decide on. I think that the sadness in songs like the sound of silence and any Dylan song is that they are handled with a softness that most comedy can't manage because it has to be verbose in order to make you laugh","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Same goes for basically every seemingly normal part of life. The only party that is interested in changing their mood is the one that has bad mood. And mood is dictated by your own thoughts, not outside events that trigger those thoughts. So please, learn to keep your shit together already, stop acting like spoiled children. Bet just a proper look into CBT would deal with both extreme reactivness and suicide ideation. Worked for me, at least. I wish people with actual cultural responsibility, the so called 'education system' and prisons would do their job better. The same deal as with kids with guns issue.

Most often it's stuff that makes us feel bad, like 9/11 or the death of Michael Jackson, the humanitarian crisis in Yemen or the OJ murder... things that aren't funny. If you told an OJ joke to the parents of the murder victims, they would not find it funny... because it's personal... but for everyone else, it can be funny... because it didn't happen to them. Similarly, the parents of the OJ victims probably appreciate a good Michael Jackson joke. : ) It's just the way it is.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I enjoyed the video but there is so much here I disagree with. I need to make it known to all five people that read this comment so I feel validated.  1. The 'representative' argument is bullshit and is what is wrong with humans in general. If we can't stop looking at individuals as representative of 'x' whole that they belong to, we will never have any sort of peaceful society. There will always be 'shitty' people in every group, not saying you are a shitty person in the scope of your video, I think you're grand, but the idea that people will see your video and believe that your views are the views of all trans is just the sort of faulty ideology that gets repeated-making it our reality. It doesn't have to be the way that things are, we make it that way.  2. Empathy is a real thing. I get that it feels nice and special to say x person can't understand x because they don't experience it, but if that was true the world would be even worse than it already is. Not saying that Ricky Gervais? should make bad trans jokes, but people that actually take the time to understand x issue, can talk about them... etc etc make jokes about them as well.  3.

"Y'know, when put this way, I can definitely see some similarities between the blind community/living as someone who is blind, and the trans community/being trans (as well as some stark differences that go a ways towards explaining why I shy away from that community in my town, alas). There's a bitterness and humor to both that nobody outside really gets. And I think I realize now a bit why transitioning, at least for me, seemed like such a whirlwind and then it was over; because it's a thing that can come to an end and you can feel right in your skin and be done with it, at least on a personal level. By contrast, a major disability like blindness, well. It's just there. Forever. Aaaaanywaaaaay.... :D  But god was this fantastic, as has been all your work that I've come to enjoy! Thank you Natalie for making me realize that I make my own trans jokes (as a trans person; I try not to joke about things I have no knowledge of, having been the butt of enough of those already; they are indeed boring), especially about the experience of having some significant weight taken off my chest. I won't bore you, but I do love recounting all the weird things nobody tells you about losing your tits. :D Best of luck to you with all the changes you're going to have made! It's a journey worth taking and when it's done (faster than you expect) you're going to feel great living in who you are. :)  And thank you for giving me another great blind joke ('It's my darkness, not yours. Get your own darkness!') that I am going to use to a) break the ice, b) laugh at my own disability and c) make able bodied people who are freaking out in my vicinity even more uncomfortable (but mostly it just makes them less afraid once I've startled the laugh out of them). :D","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Definitely don't see the comparison between Gervais's joke and Gigi's. I do not think Ricky's was better but there's a difference between working on bits at clubs for weeks always with the possibility of completely bombing, and webcam storytime videos. He made a theater of people laugh, she made you laugh. I think part of what you didn't touch on is how relatability factors into comedy. I think the reason you laugh harder and see more beauty in Gigi's joke than I do is because you relate to it more as a trans person (not cuz it's not funny to cis people, but finding something relatable is an undeniable factor in why some things are funny)  I guess my point is that comparing the two jokes is weird because Gigi's could've done very poorly at an open mic.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

If ricky had made a stand up about how much it actually hurt his feelings to have his jokes blow up in his face like that it could've actually been funny.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I love all the philosophy of comedy stuff! Nanette was my jam last year so I appreciate you building off some of her points.   I really appreciate Carlin's defense of free speech, but within the context of when he started his 'edginess,' ie the 1960s and 1970s. Recall that until the Warren Court put some trammels in place, the federal government, under the Smith Act, was prosecuting people for even sounding Communist, whether or not they'd actually done anything 'seditious.' Carlin, therefore, was defending free speech at a time when it was under much more aggressive assault. These days, while defenders of free speech must be vigilant, they don't exactly have the same high level targets anymore. Contemporary Speech Warriors thus find themselves punching down at people that are 'offended' rather than punching up at structures that persecute malcontents and radicals.   It also occurs to me that Carlin's overreach might in part be explained by the capitalist nature of his enterprise. His 'angry guy' shtick, after all, required material in order for him to keep making records and performing and, like, getting paid and stuff. So eventually, he was bound to start getting angry at silly stuff in order to pad his material and continue his career. Reminds me of Victorian novels and their often serialized nature resulting in very padded works that, from a contemporary perspective, seem bloated.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Great Video,   here are some thoughts, I remember reading an article or something about how scientists scanned the brain during laughter and tried to figure out what laughter really is and they found it is when the brain thinks there is some kind of danger and then it suddenly discovers there is no danger and so is delighted basically.   I figure that due to 'mirror neurons' this can be quite empathic and yet also sadistic or schadenfreude type laughter because the brain sees it is safe white its enemy is hurt in slapstick or whatever.  So then the darkness laughter is getting to root issues,  and even transmuting it to heal it, or cauterize it perhaps. Where as  Gervais fans are laughing because in their view Trans people dont matter and for people  its ok to laugh at someone elses pain when you dont care about them, as the brain sees there is no danger to self.    Also I was just learning today about how emotions are contagious, obviously laughter as well.  Lastly, you were far funnier than Gigi, but I never heard of her before, with so little context her story  mostly sounded sad or inspirational perhaps, anyways I am  sure you are funnier","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Using dark humor and self-deprecation as a coping mechanism has always given me mixed feelings. On one hand, I've had a dark sense of humor since I was a child and as I watched the world descend into what it is now - as well as my own mental health going down the drain - I completely understand how alleviating, cathartic, and straight up enjoyable just laughing it all off is. However, I guess another way to interpret 'twisting' the pain into comedy is simply deflecting with humor and not really facing our problems. I think that's how I ended up just letting myself be a sad fuck for so long because whenever I felt down I would laugh at how pathetic I felt or at how shit the world is - I never sought to fix my problems, which made them hurt even more. It got so bad to the point where I was jokingly talking with friends about how depressed we all were (a common gen z hobby), and I let out that I was actually feeling really depressed - but I said it as we were all laughing, so it just felt like another joke. I felt this deep sting in my chest because this culture of dark, self-deprecating, and hyperbolic humor that we've all developed meant that there was literally no way for me to express how sad I really was without straight-up sobbing. I feel like humor has saved me from much of the pain that external events would inflict, but not from the inner pain that comes from shielding myself from my own inner demons. So, I can't indulge in the darkness, but I can't ignore it either. Please help I'm only 16 lol.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I gravitate towards self deprecation and gallows humor as a form of escapism to deal with my issues - so this meant a lot for me to hear. Something about the macabre and darkness is just comforting to me, which might be sad.  I agree with what you said about edgy comedians who take jabs at certain groups, especially when it's  something they don't experience or know well enough to spin it in a way to actually be funny. I forgot who said it on Twitter, but she deconstructed gallows humor and the difference between being the person making the joke from the gallows and being the person saying it in the crowd at the expense of the person about to be hanged. It's just tough that certain people make certain routines at the expense of some minority groups, and are either unintentionally or purposefully reinforcing toxic views and ideas that make things more dangerous for those up at the gallows (like trans people).  I dunno, I think that just influence why I retreat into the darkness a lot  since you don't know if someone's perspective of you is going to be rooted in dated edgelord humor, see you as a beacon who has to educate them, both, or something darker.

Anyhooch, I do live with a lot of privilege based on how I'm perceived by most people, so if a little restraint on my part can support a lot of people who have it much worse than I do, then I don't mind putting in the effort too consider their feelings.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I guess that has to do with being out of the loop, but I didn't find the Gigi thing funny at all (and the fact that it required so much explanation kinda defeats the purpose...). Conversely, The Ricky Gervais bit from 2016 had me rolling on the floor. You can call me a monster if you want, but it didn't make me transphobic.

"To say that Ricky is just an edgelord who will try his hardest to say the next most offensive things is the same to call an offended person just a snowflake who is looking for the next thing to get most triggered by. In both cases it's not true and in both cases we are not taking into account that maybe.. maybe both parties are saying the truth. Ricky just likes to do such humor and an offended person's feelings really were hurt. In an argument with such subjective opinions there really isn't battle of who is right, because you won't persuade a person who doesn't get offended that being offended is something distant or stupid (because it is to them) and you won't persuade an easily-offended person that what was said wasn't all that offensive (because it was to them). The real objective argument is whether both parties have the right to express both the joke and the criticism to which the objective answer is, definitely. I don't think Ricky has ever called for his haters no stop posting criticism or how they have no right to express it.. while on the other hand some of his haters did call for his silence. And that's when I as an on-looker choose a side and the side is the one that does not lead to dystopian society where we won't be able to speak or think freely. At one hand I completely understand that people get offended and hurt by words (even though I am hardly ever offended) at the other offensive jokes are made to offend and we know and have defined their purpose, we know that they are just jokes and exist just to make ourselves look like assholes while really not meaning it and trying to bring mockery to the subject. And people who get offended by offensive jokes somehow don't understand that or choose not to understand that there is a difference between someone saying something offensive and saying an offensive joke. When Ricky says 'I have changed but not as much as Bruce Jenner', by using an offensive joke (which we know was its purpose) he makes himself look like an asshole and in the end mock people who would say transphobic shit. When he says that I don't think 'oooh snap he dead named her, he showed the snowflake now', no I think 'oh if someone said this seriously they would be a dick and that's the purpose of the joke to show what would be dickish to say'. I don't really know how to explain it. I am not trying to invalidate your feelings if you get offended by such jokes, I know you are offended and hurt but I think if you truly understood the purpose of offensive jokes you wouldn't be hurt.  It's like when someone says 'go make me a sandwich woman' and laughs. He shows that he doesn't mean it , he jokes about it because it's ridiculous to say such a thing, he knows it's offensive and he makes it into an offensive joke, in the end making fun of such people who would mean it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You're the first person to actually put my thoughts into words. How do you do it? Sorry, that's kind of cryptic, but I'm at 23:00 in the video and I completely relate with what you said about safe spaces being too suffocating.  I live in a progressive area, and I grew up with Tumblr so during my puberty I was an SJW.  I realized early on that I was a lesbian, so I attended my middle school's GSA (cause we had one for some reason).  I kind of 'grew out' of being an SJW when I realized how tacky it was.  I still understood the struggle of lgbtq+ people from all that time, and I at times still enjoy a good debate/conversation on the topic (which is why I love your videos), but something about the atmosphere is very, well, suffocating.  For a few years now I've realized at how toxic such 'safe spaces' can be.  You do one thing wrong, and people try to lynch you.

"Something that also muddies up the waters of comedy when it comes to this discourse is that people are starting to equate 'offensive' comedy with 'objectively good' comedy. Even if the purpose of an offensive joke is to offend, that doesn't mean it's inherently good if it's successful. So you get people knee-jerk defending offensive comedy as comedy that's just too good to be accepted by generation snowflake.   I guarantee you that if you bring up examples of comedians who are publicly looked down upon for being bad in the vein of Carlos Mencia, Jeff Dunham, and Dane Cook, the free speech brigade isn't going to come to their defense. People have to start remembering that even if comedy can succeed at being offensive can also fail at being actually funny.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"More good stuff from Contrapoints! Another opportunity to enjoy some top quality creative content for free....yay! ...free! Everybody's favourite word. Hmm. No. Not everybody's. 'Free' means , among other things, 'free of cost, of consequence, of obligation'. Aaaaand...yeah...the content is freely offered..so..that means that people on the quietist conservative Jordan Peterson ish dreaded OTHER side, may, if they so choose respond to the free content howsoever they choose. They may indeed snort derisively at the absurd antics of the despised other, and, thereby, reveal more about themselves than anything else. What might be the revelation? It might be the revelation of a sad angry bigot so diminished in self awareness and accomplishment that they must needs punch down at people who suffer with issues ( like gender dysphoria for example) that will never be their own issue. Yeah. That is surely a choice, but it might not be the most interesting choice. It might not BE the choice at all.  Okay. Here is another choice. I might say ' whatever you choose shall surely be the very best choice for you.' Now THAT is a highly attractive choice for CIS people vis a vis trans people.

You suspect that proving or disproving some thing or other to the wider YouTube audience may ( or may not) , but MAY, play some part in the thinking. You know you ought to say something like PLEASE do nothing to prove anything to an Action Flower, because an Action Flower is really, really not worth it. Nor a Ben Shapiro, nor anyone really. But you don't say anything. You just let people hurt themselves because you know how miserably hard and thankless it is to try to step between someone and their self destructive urge. You know this, cos you have your own, God knows. Insatiable craving for the approval of strangers. What a coward you are, weak Action Flower.'    Hmmm. Funny eh? Just a little routine. A little riff.

Their immature and overdone fat jokes didn't have people doubled over like my self-deprecating jokes did.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I used to know this EMS guy, and one time he had to report to an active shooter at a hospital.  The shooter killed 7 people and lit himself on fire.  My friend ended up being filmed by a news crew outside the place, his hands tangled in his hair and looking... I guess hopeless.  I can't really describe the look on his face.  About a week later, we were both drunk at a party, and I asked him how he was, and he talked about that day, 'Yeah, I got to go home early.  I got to watch TV and stuff, it was cool. Haven't had a day off in a while.'  That's tasteless and horrible... But what the fuck else can you do.  That's the opposite of edgy humor, which, to me, has always been akin to a first grader saying 'fuck' to shock people.  It's not a joke, and worse, it takes no time to think up something like that.  The 'joke' is, 'Ooooh, look at what I said!'  Any asshole can do that.  Someone with talent can make you feel something, can communicate an idea without saying it straight up; that bit where Nat talks about music hits the point right on the head.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Contra. I would love to get your opinion on Sam Hyde and MDE. To me, he is like the best internet based comedian, but his politics and general attitude is extremely mean spirited. I feel like I agree with what you are saying, but I can't help but believe comedy is being stifled oversensitivity and moral posturing. To me, that's the bigger issue. Sam, my favorite comedian, got his show on adult swim cancelled, his YouTube account deleted, and his twitter suspended, all for being offensive and never compromising. It's easy to call out big name comedians, doing hack bits in order to stay trendy, while claiming to stand for free speech. That's obviously lame. But so many people I like have been deplatformed, and it sucks.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I like her stuff usually, but this was a bit deceptive or maybe she didn't get it herself.   Ricky Gervais' Golden Globe joke was funny because he was poking fun at the fact that this jerk was turned into a 'role model' and hero because she happened to go through a transition. The punchline was a stereotype of bad women drivers because of Jenner's history. She should've shown the whole line. What he said was, 'Bruce Jenner, now Catylin Jenner of course...' connecting it to the 'change' he mentioned in the previous line that he claimed to have gone through. It's called transitioning or seguewaying in comedic jargon.   'Identifying as chimp' thing was silly. He should've known the fact that that's a trope used by transphobic people. I have no reason to believe that he did know it. I saw people making that helicopter 'joke' much later after I had heard his bit. I have no reason to believe that he was being a transphobe. And again the target wasn't transgender people. The point was there is nothing wrong with calling Jenner 'Bruce' when he was talking about her past. He used feminine pronouns when talking about her generally.   And cripple was not always a slur. That was partly the point of Carlin's bit. It's blasphemous to doubt Carlin's understanding of language.  :XD  Also, if only comedy I could get was from people who have experienced the same 'darkness' like me that would a sad world for me.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Personally i think you have to respect every human being, even when you offend them or make fun of them. Its like dark humor is like a sappy heartfelt story at heart or aproviates the object of the comedy.Needless to say the more dry witty smart comedy better. Its so good when you got a character you like and identify suffer in a comedical but way while making his way in the world and making it out alive and getting through the day comedies who treat their subjects like humans.. The exception is satire but even there comedy us human. Sure, dehumanizing clishees and offenses are can be funny, right ricky and co.

"I really can't say enough how well you combine humor and genuinely intelligent discourse on topics that are often not well-articulated.  I love your videos for that very reason.  I come away feeling like I have a better understanding of the world through your eyes, and I always find myself able to relate to some part of your personal experiences.  I don't know if the self-deprecating humor hit me the same way it might hit another person who comes to your channel with a more close-minded viewpoint, though.    While I can see that your humor would strike those people with the sort of 'cool, she can hang' feel that I've often gotten personally from cis-males when I make jokes, I think for the rest of us, your humor is just a helping hand of relateability.  As a cis-gender female living in a decidedly right-wing town and no, knowing, experience with transpeople, I often don't have a connection to what you're talking about.  However, by recounting the inherent absurdity of your life, I can relate on that level, because the fact is that all life has some level of absurdity to it.  So, really what you, and everyone else, are doing with self-deprecating humor is pointing out a basic fact that can often be overlooked.

"Aside from the entertainment value, this was a genuinely thoughtful analysis of the ethics of comedy. Not that I expected anything less, but this is a topic that doesn't get a lot of discussion other than simplistic arguments about 'free speech' vs. moral outrage, etc. I think a lot of it comes down to the overall gestalt of your personality and corpus. In other words, if you seem like a sympathetic comrade, you can get away with a lot more than someone with no regard for the welfare of X group of people. People don't just look at a given joke in isolation, or at least I don't think we should. This is why the Greeks had tragedy *and* comedy--you have to sublimate that pain somehow.

Nothing too offensive - vaccine jokes, therapists, etc - but still pretty edgy and self-deprecating. I'm really torn between the fact that I feel I'm doing good by making people laugh and proving my worth as an autistic person, but also recognizing that I'm still reinforcing stereotypes and acting as a sort of 'uncle Tom' to people I despise.

When Tiffany breaks down in the 'Tiffany Tumbles' video, when you described blocking 4chan from your computer in the 'Incels' video, and when you sang 'The Sound of Silence,' even when you had disparaged your singing voice and proficiency.

"I think a good rule of thumb is does the humor of the joke require a distrust or dislike of the subject in order to be funny. If it does it isn't comedy it is at best hateful satire. My father used to tell a joke where he said a black friend of his told him 'Frank I had a job once....worst 4 hours of my life'. That's not a good joke because it requires that you dislike or at least think all black men are lazy to find it funny, it's a necessary condition to the humor of it. Compared to a comic I heard joking about how black people shout in theatres saying in the movie Jaws all the black folks were like 'damn bitch get out of the water don't you hear the music !' This joke is good in my opinion because though black people are kind of known for shouting out in theatres (any one offended by that please get help) the humor of it does not require that you have a distrust or dislike of black people to laugh at it, in fact the audience was mostly black and they roared with laughter at it. The first joke requires that you have some negative feelings towards black people to find it funny the second does not. So yes this means Gervais is largely a shit comic not just for his Trans jokes but also many others he does. He is sometimes very funny but he can't seem to make the distinction I made above very well at all nor do I think he wishes to.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The only thing I have to add is a general disappointment in contemporary comedians. Not all of them, but... a lot of them. I think too many are trailing behind form the era of the 'Neo Liberal' paradise that was the '80s, '90s, and even the early stretch of the 2000s. Back when being 'politically correct' was more of a novelty and basically consisted of not being nakedly hostile. Some of them, I think, don't know how to be 'funny' without attacking a minority group in one way or another. They 'identify' with the audience by picking some group and saying 'ha, weirdos, amiright? Clearly I'm one of you, when compared to those _freaks.'_ You might hear a lot of professional comedians express anger or frustration at those who get 'cheap laughs' but apparently don't see the hypocrisy.  Oh, by the way, talking about self deprecating humor, I was reminded of a common refrain I or a friend would make in high school -- as it's own sort of humorous callback after any deprecating joke: 'Laughing on the outside, crying on the inside' always followed by falling silent, grin fading, and just staring blankly at the middle distance for a few seconds. Laughter only goes so far.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Just to be clear: If you - as a transwoman - pre-op, pre-hormonally jizz in a cup, to later artificially impregnate your future transman's pre-op uterus, you will be the father of that child .... and whoever carried it in her belly and birthed it, will be the mother. No matter whatever hormones they have taken and whatever parts of themselves they have cut off or tagged on.  There is no going around that.  Transwomen can not be mothers, they can only be fathers!  We may be in the middle of successfully confusing people to the point of destroying the categories 'man' and 'woman', but 'father' and 'mother' stand biologically ankered by the fact that there is only one way it can be done ... even for transmen and transwomen.  So you can only play these opposite roles, you can never really be it. I submit, that is the final limit to this gender-game.  Thanks to modern medicine and a reckless procreation industry, we as a society can look forward to some very confused children in the future.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

They especially hate my autistic headcanons since they think I either just calling fictional characters autistic, or I'm just armchair diagnosing them. Not to mention none of my headcanons would make perfect representations of autism: as an example, Mashiro Shiina from Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo is quite much has an idealized version of autism, and she sometimes gets sexualized and she's 17. However she was what I was needed at the time since almost all representation of autism in the media is ableist garbage (my personal favorite is the cliche of the stereotypical 'low-functioning' boy who has a meltdown every 5 second with no reason), and her behavior being shown as cute instead of something that people should be ashamed of and worthy of harsh bullying.

"That singing was haunting. I was vaguely reminded of Billie Holiday. Good job! This video spoke to me eVeN tHoUgH i'M a CiS wOmAn because I feel like self-deprecation makes half of my personality, whether it be esteem issues from being bullied as a kid, the anxiety that comes with having a neurotic asian parent, the political climate of today, being a former 'gifted' kid, or emotional damage from 'growing up Catholic' (all first world problems, I know). People have told me that they worry when I talk about leaping off buildings or jumping into pits of fire at the slightest inconvenience and I used to try to stop myself from saying those things and 'think positive', but I ultimately was just ignoring my feelings. Maybe there's a better way of coping with stuff, but self-deprecation is a good thing to 'numb the pain' while I try to find the root of stuff. I do usually use music to cope when I can. A good Shostakovich symphony can do wonders.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"ContraPoints. Natalie. My darling Queen and cherished comrade. I need you to know that you have, in under half an hour, consolidated more than six years of reflection and political dithering in one radiant cornerstone of fine art. I'm going to be rewatching this likely more than ten times, just to fully grasp every minute detail and idea expressed.  I have, ever since a friend of mine in 7th grade told me he believed 'rape jokes are never funny', been thoroughly curious about the nature of humor and offensiveness, and at times stood on either pole, believing at one point that it was unacceptable to even call things 'stupid' in private, and at another that the n-word was only bad because people let it get to them. As you so eloquently placed it, 'edginess' is (both metaphorically and, frankly, literally) adolescent, but your idea of 'darkness' is mature, capable of weighing out the balance between harm and humor. I feel as though I have a much more mature understanding of the topic now, and whether that's due to six years of development psychologically or theoretically, I am climactically granted the specific terminological tools to describe my new nuanced position thanks to this exploration of The Darkness. So, I would very much like to reiterate, you have delivered unto me the ultimate ability to parse whatever I believe is and is not acceptable in humor, and for that I am incomprehensibly grateful.  Long live the Queen. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention, your voice is simply angelic <3","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Here's a little food for thought regarding both ignorantly playing into hackneyed tropes for cheap laughs and treating comedy as a conscious, intentional balancing act of moral compass and edginess:    'A work of art is the unique result of a unique temperament. Its beauty comes from the fact that the author is what he is. It has nothing to do with the fact that other people want what they want. Indeed, the moment that an artist takes notice of what other people want, and tries to supply the demand, he ceases to be an artist, and becomes a dull or an amusing craftsman, an honest or a dishonest tradesman. He has no further claim to be considered as an artist. Art is the most intense mode of Individualism that the world has known. I am inclined to say that it is the only real mode of Individualism that the world has known.' -Oscar Wilde, from 'The Soul of Man Under Socialism'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It's also interesting in terms of a historical lense.  Today transgender identity is very closely linked to 'queer' identity and begin open and accepting but back then it really wasn't. historically you had the 'double bump' demographic anomaly one large group of 40+ Transitioners who held very patriarchal views of sex, and a smaller more modern group of younger transition Again begin associated with 'queer' identity wasn't something most of us were interested in such much, as we all just wanted to hide pass and become 'stealth' mostly.   and their has been alot of tension on those comics which you can see in the comic whereas this has largely vanished today now it's alot more relaxed about individuals and letting everyone have unique views about their own gender expression including your aforementioned 'Girl penises' ect.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's pretty funny how many people think I practice black magick just because I have a keen interest in researching esoteric subjects and I'm a member of the OTO (known these days mostly because of Jack Parsons... and that mostly just because of the TV show Strange Angel). On that note, not everyone in the OTO looks up to Aleister Crowley as a role model... I'd even say most don't. I take what I see works and resonates within Crowley's Thelemic system and I ditch the rest of his egoic madness. That said the OTO was a safe haven for the LGBT community for the past 100 years in large part because of Crowley's open approach to sexuality. Sexuality and magick are inseparable. The OTO broke away from Freemasonry for many reasons but a large one was that the OTO admitted both men and women, believing they are capable of the same spiritual growth. Freemasonry on the other hand, at least in the 'regular' Lodges, only admits men to the highest degrees. For those interested in these subjects I'd love to talk more in depth, feel free to respond here :)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"On this one, I think you're preaching to your community more than anything else. It seems like an entire terminology was created by a part of the trans community, and you're subjectively acknowledging that terminology as more correct. For instance, saying it's more correct to call the operation a 'Gender Confirmation Surgery' instead of a 'Sex Change Operation' is discarding what 'correct' actually means for everyone outside that same community you relied on for terminology. And the surgery example is a perfect one at that. The surgery doesn't confirm anything, other than flesh having been shuffled around such that one sex's genetalia is transformed into that of another sex, thus 'Sex Change Operation'. As someone who is outside the trans community, I see those words as the correct ones: straightforward and factual. On the other hand, 'Gender Confirmation Surgery' is completely incorrect: nothing was done to one's gender... other people's perception barely change, the patient's perception doesn't change that significantly compared to say the other steps and ultimately no surgery is done on 'a gender', which is physically impossible to do. Further more, someone could have a 'Sex Change Operation' and still have his gender unchanged: I could get my penis transformed and still be of the male gender. Complete misnomer. For both practical and philosophical reasons.  To test out a logic, you also have to change its parameters.  But say we take violent psychopaths... do you really want to start calling it 'Trait Confirmation Act of Violence' instead of what it is: 'Murder'? Sure, the violent psychopaths community could decide on their own terminology, but... would that be more correct and should others outside that community use the terminology dictated by that community? (And again, would you call a psychopathic serial killer's chosen nickname his 'biological name'? No. You would probably say it's his name, or whatever, but not his 'biological name' even if his genes predisposed that person to murder.)  To assume one as correct is to invite the other. Without personal opinion, I simply ask: are you okay with both?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Yet another masterpiece. Ricky Jervais is indeed the lowest form of comedy. Only thing I disagree with is that whole 'Self-deprecation in subverted groups is humiliation' part. In much the same way that you don't want to be automatically seen as a representative of all trans people. Self-deprecation is the most destructive and yet purest form of comedy. It makes no assumptions, it pulls no punches, and it only offends those who relate to your experiences. As someone who spent his 20's suicidal pretty much every day, I HATED when people looked at me with pity when I made a self-deprecating joke. If I wanted pity I wouldn't have made a joke! It's extremely presumptive to equate a self-deprecating trans joke with proliferation of trans bigotry. All of our experiences are unique and disallowing people to discuss their own experiences is possibly the most snowflake thing on earth.  However that's literally one single point. Everything else, perfect. Love you Natalie","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Too often others want everything in trans life-experience to be so damn serious all the time. Don't I just get to laugh or crack a dark joke about it?   I'm tired of hearing, 'you're so brave,' it was really brave of me to exist today. Recently the sports world has turned to baring trans competitors. I get comments or questions from friends in the fitness world that I'm 'out' to. About it, I get genuine shock when I offer what I think is a nuanced view. Which is really anything but absolute leftist or right thinking. I'm tired of being other peoples mascot. Feels like fair weather fanning.

"'The world is not built on the laws they love. Not on friendship, but on mutual interest. Not on peace, but on victory by any means. The universe is run by extinction, by extermination, by gamma-ray bursts burning up a thousand garden worlds, by howling singularities eating up infant suns. And if life is to live, if anything is to survive through the end of all things, it will live not by the smile but by the sword, not in a soft place but in a hard hell, not in the rotting bog of artificial paradise but in the cold hard self-verifying truth of that one ultimate arbiter, the only judge, the power that is its own metric and its own source--existence, at any cost. Strip away the lies and truces and delaying tactics they call 'civilisation' and this is what remains, this beautiful shape.  The fate of everything is made like this, in the collision, the test of one praxis against another. This is how the world changes: one way meets a second way, and they discharge their weapons, they exchange their words and markets, they contest and in doing so they petition each other for the right to go on being something, instead of nothing. This is the universe figuring out what it should be in the end.  And it is majestic. Majestic. It is the only thing that can be true in and of itself.  And it is what I am'. - The Darkness","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
