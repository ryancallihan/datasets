"It's so sad that some people feel the need to criticize/discriminate/hurt others who are just living their lives and not harming anyone  I'm from Austria and we have an annual event called the life ball which is basically a huge LGBTQ+ event, some people dress up in costumes some don't and it's just colorful, everyone's happy and and accepting. Whenever I'm there I think to myself what a shame it is that this is just one day in a year. Everyday should be like that! The atmosphere and energy there is so loving and compassionate...I really wish that at some point in the future, the possibility to be whoever you want to be and not being judged for it, won't be restricted to special events like the life ball or the pride parade. Let's hope we get there!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I think of myself as a 'feminist' but I'm not a TERF.  I think there is still, after all these decades, a lot of disagreement or misunderstanding of what 'feminism' actually is.  And I'm glad that you have been using the term TERF because we really do need to have a clear distinction between men and women who are feminists and men and women who find trans people 'too different' or repulsive.  Basically, language gets very twisted around, because human beings are so F-ing crazy, don't you think?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I would like to add that having the experience of being a woman or growing up as a woman varies so much not just from from person to person but also from country to country and no one would expect a cis woman to go through a certain amount of suffering just to count as a woman as an adult or as a person worthy of joining the feminist movement. I spent a while living in Egypt and a while in Germany as a child and the difference of how you are treated is so vast that I feel fairly comfortable in saying that in some way it could be comparable to growing up trans vs growing up cis. So unless we impose a harmful and very specific standard of how one has to have experienced the oppression of the patriarchy to be a woman this point is utterly moot.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm ashamed I've wondered myself about trans women trying to remove themselves from toxic masculinity and becoming women but I understand the need to fit in. The trans community is one of the toughest groups I've ever seen. No one could truly want to be trans. I imagine there are a few online individuals who do it to score points, but trying to live your life when everyone screams at you to stop is obviously challenging. I'm trying to be better and become an ally worth standing at your sides. I certainly don't want to steal your voices, or become the image everyone sees. That's why your work is so incredibly vital. Trans people need to be their own voice, and I think as an ally, it's my job to ask others to listen.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

And I would never pretend I know better than a trans person when it comes to their gender identity but I have to admit, since I believe gender is a construct, a part of me wonders how that is compatible with trans identity.

Also as a lesbian and a feminist I think if there ever was a contest of the America's Next Victim, Trans women would win obviously. Like who are we kidding? My experience as a woman in society is hard (but as a lesbian I also have a camaraderie with men that 'protects' me from some of the discrimination straight women experience) but a trans woman ???

"I think you explain things well, you are very fair minded, and  I love your self deprecating sense of humour. I must say though that the venomous criticism of Germaine Greer that I hear from some people in this corner of the internet does not sit well with me. Germaine Greer made a lot of valuable contributions to the discussions in second and third wave feminism. But she feels, like I feel, that the destructive and oppressive experience of growing up as a woman and the discussions related to our reproductive rights  are a very , very integral part of what it is like to live as a woman. I do not reduce women to their reproductive biology and I am not trying to 'gatekeep' trans women from being considered women.  However, if you grow up as a biological woman, you cannot escape, for instance, the load of thinking about birth control and  the abortion debate. I've experienced trans women being less than sympathetic to these issues of cis women online. (I'm not saying that trans women do not have their own, very considerable amount of shit to deal with from society, just that the experience is not entirely the same. Cis and trans women have overlapping experiences rather than identical ones, some parts are not shared) Sometimes when I listen to you, I do sense the 'privilege' of having grown up as an upper middle class male with the confidence that that entails, and I feel that men agreeing with you over 'cis female' voices is just people taking the scenic route to shitting on women (and their stupid opinions) yet again.  I'm honestly triggered.   And I'm not looking to make it your problem,  I'm trying to explain where cis women that have a certain amount of discomfort with the discussion  about trans women and inclusion may be coming from.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Of course with a brain scan u would have more chance to get it right, but this doesn't mean that there is no other way to verify it without a brain scan, with a certain amount of accuracy.

There is male and female in like 99% of cases. Then like 1% is born with something other than xy or xx chromosomes. But these people arent usually the nonbinary, genderqueer etc people. These people usually also identify AS either male or female (since they usually lean more towards one or the other biologically still).  A masculine woman is still a woman. A feminine man is still a man. Can someone please explain? Im rather confused .  Also , male privelege. Really? I think privelege is more complicated than that.

But after this video, after listening to how you feel and why you do it... I get it. I really do.  If I feel so bad as a women to be compared to a men I can only imagine how a trans person would feel beying called 'trap' or a gender that he/she does not identify. Even if I don't dress the way people tell me to dress people still see me as a She and that's a privilege that not everyone have. So thanks for this video.

"I must say love, you do have a knack for keeping the interest of others and that is a talent in itself, my idea of a trans woman is a man who decided to become a female, simply that, and vice versa for females who decide to become a man.  I like that you give other sides of this and explain how others may view trans women, I also love the theatrics, marvelous. I also want to express that I would love for us all to remain our own self based on our genders loving the Creator and knowing that we are already designed perfectly from the start of the first breath, oh and even before that.  I also live in reality and know that my views and opinions does not express that of the masses.  I personally am a female, biologically, and have had many girlfriends in the past, yes. I am not knew to trans people at all levels of their transitioning.  I know we have many ways in which we live our lives among each other.

I know it excludes transmen and NB people but I don't think its ok for women to be shamed for not using inclusive language when it is largely just women that are being oppressed and controlled.

"My first ContraPoints video and here are a few thoughts (feel free to tap out and the like button at any point in this comment):    0) The fact your subscribers don't exceed the population of 50% of the global population is bullshit. YOU ARE MY NEW FAVOURITE YOUTUBER.  1) You are hilarious. Witty, well-timed, densely layered, balanced against argument, fair. Just *MWAH*. As a stand-up geek, this is just brilliant. Your timing is natural, pointed and well spaced.  2) You're smart. Not smart in the 'I have more IQ points and I'm gonna bombard you till you become tired and agree' sense. Or the 'I'm not gonna argue with you as much as character assassinate you till anything you say is rendered invalid by being said by you' sense. Or any other than, 'here's an argument. I know arguments. I defend my links, premises, and conclusions. I know your argument. I know its flaws and its weaknesses in the thorough academic canon. I also know how to argue without being an arsehole.'  3) You know how political arguments work. They're designed to ask hard questions which are unanswerable rapidly. Bullshit is quick, insight is not. You know what to dismiss, what to take seriously, when to accept and when to avoid speaking altogether. That's rare. That takes a lot of practice and careful thought. Well done.  4) You know rhetoric, in its best possible form. You prefix your arguments well, suggesting a knowledge of the breadth of the topic and enhancing your own humility. You also know when to prefix with expertise, punchy arguments and humour to ingratiate your argument to the opponent.  5) You dismiss political buzzwords. Buzzwords like 'libtard, HAM, snowflake, Nazi, femiNazi, and especially TERF, etc.' aren't arguments. They're words, with implications and an efficient way to hurl an essay at someone else in a few guttural noises. You address them, not exploit them. You speak with them after clarifying their vague meanings. It's the best way to use them.   6) You know advanced logic and political fallacies from the 'gotcha' to the 'tirade of bullshit' to 'PRATT' to 'rhyme equals reason,' even if you don't name them. The moment where you addressed troll statements was textbook. You do better than that: you explain them and discredit them.  7) You know how to concede and agree. Frequently, some arguments are unwinnable. That isn't the fault of the defendant but the fault of the douchery of the person who said the argument. Like 'you should be working to abolish gender,' to which the response which you gave is perfect 'how in the fuck is one person supposed to do that? How am I to even answer that argumentatively? That burden of proof is excessive and no thanks.' It's endearing and to the careful eye shows far more insight than ignorance.  8) You know how to be reasonable. Your entire argument is both successful AND fair. I've trusted Trans dogma on the 'experiencing a female upbringing from afar.' Yet you give up on that and still argue insightfully. It's rare to wholly decisively win an argument without being an underhanded bastard.  9) You are so gorgeously well-read. Your referencing and quoting like an academic master. I love it. Sylvia Plath responded to clearly and objectively is just mood.  10) You know how to burn strawmen. You often say 'what I am not saying or am saying' which defuses reductionist responses so elegantly and rapidly.   11) You have such empathy for the otherside, which I am so thankful for.     *RAPTUROUS APPLAUSE*","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hi, I really love your videos. I've been researching a lot into the whole radical feminism thing after being called a terf (for daring to state that penises are technically male sexual biology whether or not they belong to a woman... TO a trans woman who was saying that any of us lesbians who didn't want to have sex with her because of her penis were transphobic bigots). So. Learning lots about politics on that end of things, and of course your videos offer a really great insight into the trans side of the equation. I did want to point out though, from what I've learned about the whole 'abolish gender' thing, you did get it right that the idea is to do away with societal gender roles that say you can only express yourself the way you do if you take on the identity of a woman. It doesn't mean to remove all gender expression and stereotypes, but to remove them from their ruling position over the sexes.   Radical feminism states that you should have every right and freedom to be yourself completely as you are and still be able to categorize yourself as the male you were born as, just as anyone born a female should be free to express herself to the fullest extents of masculinity if desired (including breast removal and all of it) without having to renounce her status as female. I understand that it calls for a huge overworking of society and is way too enormous of an ambition to take place any time soon, but with the fervor that trans activists are pouring out and the real change they are affecting in society today to become accepted as their identified gender, I could see this goal happening pretty realistically. Imagine if, rather than butting heads with both trans and biological women fighting over the rights to be called a 'real woman,' both groups could join forces in solidarity for an outcome that would make everyone happy. Male and female, both free to live and express their lives as masculine or feminine as they desire without the social pressure (but still the freedom) to alter their bodies. Yes, new challenges would surely come with it, but when you already have people viciously attacking others for refusing to use 'she' instead of 'he' because language usage is so deeply ingrained in our society, it seems like an uphill battle either way.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think the only thing I agree with the 'gender critical' feminists about is that the trans community is extremely quick to label feelings of discomfort with your assigned gender as a sign that you are trans and should transition. Trans communities and issues tend to get a lot more visibility than non-binary ones -- and I think that it's unfortunate that many people experiencing some version of dysphoria aren't exposed to non-binary ideas because trans communities are (dare I say) over-zealous about welcoming new members into the group.    I know Natalie has said that the goals of non-binary activists are sometimes at odds with her own (i.e. throwing off gender roles completely vs. fitting into a different gender role than the one you were assigned), and I'm personally of the opinion that we as a society should ideally be moving toward the non-binary model. That said, I also like many things about being a woman, getting to dress up and wear makeup from time to time, and I certainly don't think there's anything wrong with liking to present in a very binary way. I simply think that non-binary, as well as femme-presenting men and butch-presenting women should receive equal airtime in the circles where people experiencing dysphoria go for help.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It really bothers me that you largely dismiss the arguments by assuming they're not made in good faith. I genuinely have a hard time with trans folk who **don't have gender dysphoria** (incredibly important distinction) claiming that they're a different gender/agender because their interests line up more with the stereotypes of the other gender/no or both genders. This has seriously had an effect that I'm noticing in my every day life. I have several friends who now identify as nonbinary and they tell me that it's because they don't identify with society's idea of what it means to be a man/woman. What happened to saying fuck society and fuck stereotypes? Why are we not only allowing, but fighting for them to define our identities just as much as they ever have?   I'm also not making the argument that we should abolish all outward signs of gender and I really don't like the accusation that I'm saying these things because of some subconscious feeling of transphobia I have deep down inside of me... I don't feel that these concerns have anything to do with my opinion on the morality of identifying as a different gender. They're 100% about my hatred of stereotypes. I'd like it if my concerns could actually be addressed and I'd love it if they could be mitigated.

No matter how many delusional people voice their support, shout me down or whatever you are a MAN. A very seriously disturbed man. Sexual mutilation will not change that. The fact is you KNOW it on a deep level even if you will never admit it. It is not loving to say I support you. I don't. What is loving is to say you and everyone that thinks they are something they are not need serious help.

"I want to make clear that I am wholly supportive of people who experience and live a trans identity or lifestyle.  Here's the 'but' that I've discovered is a contentious position. I believe gender should cease to exist in society. This doesn't mean everyone becomes expressionless robots, but that any person should be able to present themselves in any way they prefer, with no expectation that their sex ought to conform to a certain presentation. This includes a person's preference to modify their body to present themselves as they would like. I've been told that my position invalidates trans people's experience, but I disagree. I feel that my belief that gender roles, norms, and stereotypes should be abolished would alleviate gender dysphoria, eliminate the concept of 'transitioning' in a binary as a necessity, and reduce the pressure that some trans women feel to present themselves in a hyperfeminine way that goes beyond their preferred expression. A man or woman should be able to wear a dress, grow a beard, wear lipstick, get jacked, be a homemaker, and carry a pretty pink purse if that's what suits them. They should be able choose to go fully in the direction of what are currently deemed feminine/masculine aesthetics and roles, regardless of sex, and have no fear of being seen as insufficient or 'not passing' because there should be nothing to pass as. I don't believe I'm at odds with the current transgender community, but I've seen some people express that they believe I am. I don't consider myself to identify as a gender. I'm biologically male, I'll wear either gender's clothing, sometimes I wear eye makeup, I love flowing skirts, but that's the one piece that I prefer not to express with because the uncomfortability of social mockery outweighs the comfort of expression.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"A great video by any metric, and should be required viewing for anybody with an excess of confidence in the fitness and merit of their conceptions.  I would like to put in, if I may, that my experience of TERFs is quite different than Ms. Wynn's, and that if I had to make a general observation it would be that they seem for the most part to be TRANS MEN IN DENIAL.  By all appearances, they see their femaleness strictly in terms of the genitalia (and attendant hormones, social expectations, prejudice &c.) with which they have been saddled, for which they feel nothing but disdain.  They resent cis men, on the one hand, for their ability to exist without such sordid encumbrance, and trans women--on the other--both for actually WANTING such a burdensome equipage and for never having been subject to the stigma and liability attendant upon it.  To be clear, I wouldn't dispute whether there are other types of TERFs.  I submit only what I have observed, and what it seems to suggest in terms of their motivations.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I agree with everything, except for your arguments at concern 3, abolish gender. As identifying as non-binary (or just human...), this is crucial for me.  You just joked around about this, not taking it seriously, wich is quite disrespectful to non-binary people really, and also harmful for the feminist movement in general.   Your only real argument to not do more about it, is basically that it's too hard and utopian? So we shoud like... not act like anti rascists because it's utopian to have a society without racism? That's lazy thinking. We should do everything we can, even if we can never experience the ideal society, because that will probably never happen in our lifetime. Doesn't mean things can't be a lot better. It already IS a lot better, more and more people dare to dress non conforming and have the hobbies and lifestyles they want. There seems to be a lot more non-binary people popping up everywhere. People who just don't care that they will be misgendered, because whatever someone call you, it's going to be the wrong description anyway. There's really only two areas where it's important to adress someone by which genitals they may have: Doctors office, and sometimes dating, really.   I'm not saying specifically binary trans people have to be in the front of this movement, they have enough problems already and I support people to dress and act and live as they please. But to not do more about it as a society, is my problem. Especially when it comes to for example raising children, advertisement, or in creating norms and spaces.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Even if some the rhetoric is hard to hear, I find that when  both parties are respectful of each other it isn't nearly as hateful as you make it out to be.

I get the point that right-wing people who use the argument generally don't care about modern feminist clothing and beauty standards, but shouldn't trans people be more vocal about it too? The two ideals are complete opposites but I only ever see trans people pointing out the trolling about modern feminist ideas from the right and never being critical of the feminists themselves.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think the closest I ever came to being a TERF was in sharing similar views to yours around gender metaphysics. I don't believe in gender essentialism, including essentialism that accommodates trans identities (e.g. female brain vs. male brain stuff). I drifted to TERFdom briefly by over-emphasizing the importance of this abstract belief, but then I realized quickly how insignificant this point was compared to the real-life violence and oppression faced by trans people, which deserved far more consideration. Who am I to tell trans people they're wrong for not embracing gender non-essentialism when no one else even does? I'm sure they don't have the time. Plus, I wasn't being respectful to those who do have essentialist philosophies around gender (e.g. spiritual beliefs).  All in all, I still hold the personal belief that non-essentialist definitions of identity are no less valid or 'real', and that embracing this idea would ultimately put less pressure on people who are trying to find themselves (generally speaking). But there is no reason to criticize trans feminism over that whatsoever. And TERFdom was a totally dumb place to look for that philosophy anyway.  Edit: also thought it was worth mentioning that radfem stance on porn and sex work, as a former sex worker, drew me into TERFdom first. I think a lot of feminists fall into it that way too. Btw I hope all this rambling is okay as a very late response to your initial request for former TERFs to come out of the woodwork.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"so when a terf says T-women are not women. are you lumping them all together as a monolith or are they varied and nuanced like trannies? Maybe they are using metaphorical language to describe the very argument you use in concern 3 in regards to socialisation. MtF trans are not the same as women because fundamentally they have very different childhood experiences. That alone serves to prove that although some TERFS are mean calling trans folks it. Doesn't mean they are all immoral or disrespectful towards trans folk. They just don't believe they are the same as women. Which YOU FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE. Also.. sad that people are afraid to say your attractive in public but they say it in private? How tf do you know that though? I think you are attractive.... but you dont know i wouldnt say in IRL and if I didn't it wouldnt be a result of stigma, it's a result of women assuming every compliment from a guy is a sexual move to get in her pants.

Unless you are in a direct conversation which they initiated, it is extremely scary and anxiety inducing to try and communicate with any person, let alone a lady and tell them you are attracted to them.

Perhaps this is something you've spoken about before, and if so, I apologize. And I only ask this to you, not because I think you contradict gender, but because you pursued your gender. Most of my and my peer's relationship with gender is something along the lines of 'Roll with what you got and see where you go,' but I think you could potentially provide a much more specific understanding. Thanks! :)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"What confuses me about all the talking 'gender critical' feminists do about how it's totally obvious that trans women aren't 'real' women just from looking at them is that I'm biologically female and have always identified as female and yet at multiple points throughout my life, I've been mistaken for a male based on my manner of dress, the length of my hair, rather or not I'm wearing makeup, how my makeup is done, how I carry myself, etc. but if anyone was to imply that the fact that I could be mistaken for a male at times when I was not overtly presenting as a traditional female meant that I wasn't a 'real' woman those same 'gender critical' feminists would come to my defense and be furious on my behalf.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"If appearing like a woman isn't what you're saying makes you a woman than what is it that makes you a woman? What is it that you can now do that you couldn't do before that means you are now a woman? Just like the cosmetic definition of gender any other definition than biological sex people will take issue with.   'Femphobia' is rooted in misogyny? What you were talking about here doesn't hurt women at all, and plenty of very feminine women have this phobia.   The whole 'trans women being feminine is bad, trans women being masculine is bad' point you made was really a strawman. People who think this think trans women being caricatures of women is bad, and trans women being biologically male is bad; not a contradiction.   Best wishes.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

No matter how I behave I will always just be simplified down to my gender's worst examples or corkboarded and red stringed on how indirectly this is men's fault. Thus my fault. All problems are men's fault I suppose. 'Doesn't matter who is transphobic all that matters who maybe invented it... MEN!' I am tired of feelin' like a villian. I don't need a group for self loathing or accepting the stigmatic demonization of my demographic, singled out of conversations, or have my demographic's issues ignored or told 'it is men's fault so yours' Of course not you but men... But expect it being thrown in your face nontheless... Because men did it. But I am suppose to empathize with the blanketed animosity I get because it is woke.

"This video is probably the most informative I've seen about trans issues and I appreciate the attention to detail with addressing points. That being said maybe you or someone in the comments and answer this question for me.   I understand that gender dysphoria is a very real  thing. My question is why is the primary remedy (as far as I'm aware) making external changes to the body to reflect a certain mental state when we could instead allow the mind to become comfortable and accepting of the body it's in? I mean I can understand that traditional ideas of what men and women should be would be off putting to someone who feels that they are more in touch with the opposite gender to their own but I feel like that's more of an issue with societies representation of gender rather than a justification to reassign yourself to better fit those representations. I can't help but think that if just being called sir could ruin your day then addressing your brains ability to accept it's body should take priority over extensive surgery and hormone treatments for what is ultimately a cosmetic change. If wearing a dress and putting on make up as a man makes you feel more comfortable I'm all for it, I just think that unnecessary surgery isn't great for your body. Again I don't know if this is discussed during consultations before transitioning but anyone wanna clear this up for me? Contributions much appreciated.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As an Australian, I have to deal with these shitheads all throughout our academia which Greer basically stole a million bucks out of with the help of Sheila Jeffreys.   I find it funny how people accuse the '''liberal media''' is somehow magically on our side when Australia and the UK feel the desperate need to host Greer on every type of commentary panel every time she alternates whatever habitat she feels will give her the most money and the most attention at whatever time of the year.  And how many Australian faces of the trans community that are actually educated and have something to say about politics and are routinely asked to comment about any sort of issues in the world or domestically?  ... Um .... Cate McGregor?   I mean she was a Colonel and Group Captain in the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, and the Director of the Army Land Warfare Studies Centre ... She got an Order of Australia for her services at the LWS Centre so she's gotta be smart about certain things...   And that's great... finally out trans women talking about all sorts of stuff other than being trans! We're also normal people with normal careers and career projectories and experiences! -- But not a whole lot of trans faces at all.... Shitload of transphobes in academia and journalism though -- making money exclusively by being transphobic, and nothing else.  Actually having read some of Cate McGregor's stuff and she's a great scholar of military science and was an effective director at the ALWSC. That being said, problematically Catherine McGregor could be described as conventionally conservative. Which is -- not great. And probably explains why the media glommed onto her as opposed to letting her slide into obscurity as simply a strategist, director and PR consultant in the Army and RAAF.  That being said -- what, exactly, does a Sheila Jeffreys or Germaine Greer actually bring other than transphobia to any sort of political discussion?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"For me exploring these ideas, I want to know why a person wants to pass as the gender opposite to their sex. Why do they care? And why do people care about preventing others from doing that?  But a big concern I have is when people don't seem able to define what a man or woman is. Because how does somebody ever know that they aren't a man, or a woman, or even neither? Its like everybody is given permission to define their own personal truth, their own definitions of 'man' and 'woman'. And only then do they decide whether they fit into one or neither category.  I think the convention that a man is an adult male person, and a woman is an adult female person is very useful. Some people may be dissatisfied with societal expectations and connotations but at least we know what the words mean.   And it might be a storm in a teacup, except a lot of angst and pain and doubt is being generated because people are unsure of their gender. And no wonder. There is literally no way to answer them except by pointing to volatile cultural references about how males and females relate to the rest of society. And people wallow in this mess. And I don't think it needs to be that complicated.  I am sure there would still be a lot of people struggling with their identity no matter how we approach it. But I think clearing up the language and terminology of man and woman, and grounding it in the biological convention, will help people to comprehend and communicate their experiences much better.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"To me it really seems to be a junction of language colliding with personal truths. Language necessitates that people agree upon what words mean. Personal truths is where definitions get to fluctuate. I honestly think that's where all the tension stems from. Personally I am not a fan of personal truths, I think absolute truths are real, they can be known and they matter. And I am particularly fussy about words having defined meanings, because discussions and disagreements don't matter if we don't know what the words mean.  Also while I want to be agreeable and generally will cooperate with people on requested pronouns, this video made a very good point: Using requested phrases would make me an accomplice to legitimising something I don't agree with. At least not yet. I think using language in a way I find in-congruent is the main thing that concerns me. But to reiterate I also think a lot of people are hating themselves because they are confused about things that have not grounding and have no answer.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thank you for taking some of these questions seriously. I think you did a great job answering these questions. My concern is actually around getting our terms and ideas more accurate and consistant, because I think Ideas like 'a woman trapped in a mans body' sounds confused an unhealthy IF taken literally. These 'wrong ideas' can give people unhealthy ideas about themselves. I really do think Narrative and framing makes all the difference not only in main stream acceptance and integration, but also with a more personal healthy psychological expression. And I think this also goes for categories like 'gay' and 'straight' when people want there to be a 'gay gene' so they can prove their preference is rooted in their biology to back up this 'I was born this way' bumper sticker when a better more accurate sticker would be 'I can't help what I like'. Even though there are biological factors, sexual preference is probably more of an expression of nurture and life experiences than nature. (Though neither of these stickers is going to matter to the people who think nature is sinful, fallen, evil and something to be corrected anyways.) - But the over arching theme in my mind is a 'psychological stigma' around certain categories and our potential to relate ourselves to 'false binaries' like 'Gay or Straight' or even 'social gender roles' like typical 'Male and Female' archetypes..  Maybe your representation of 'beyond gender' is what other people are advocating for but for me it was a bad analogy. I don't think we would create a 'non-gendered' situation. It would be more like 'express yourself how ever you want' as you said in your video about beauty, talking about 'personal style'. From the perspective a person can express themselves how ever they like, but it doesn't change their biology. - And it terms of personal development I do think being comfortable with what are considered both 'masculine and feminine traits' in our selves is healthy.   So just in terms of language. I see that you live your life as a woman. I think you pass. I even think you are beautiful - inside and out. I think you are cool, and smart, and I like you. I think you are even probably as healthy, thoughtful, and as self aware as a person can be deciding that you want to get surgery and change your look. I have nothing but good feelings and wishes for you. I would respect your desire to be called whatever you like. That being said, to me and according to our current definitions 'man and woman' are not 'social genders' but 'biological distinctions'.  Masculine and Feminine are the 'social role' words. - I completely honor and respect your choices. My concern is that we actually talk about these things in a way that is fair and honest to both sides. I don't even think 'trans-gender' is the correct word for switching from one gender to the other since 'trans' usually means above or beyond, but I get that 'gender transition' gets shortened to 'trans-gender'.  I think we DO need more videos like this, So thank you again. These issues are important and the conversations do far too often devolve into calling people haters, bumpers sticker answers, and playing the victim,  and as you say, there are good and valid reasons for this in general. (and to be honest, though I am interested in discussing these Ideas I also don't want to upset anyone or make anyone feel hated on or unaccepted, and I think a lot of people feel this way and so just don't talk about it.) These really are important issues for everyone not only because we share a world, we want to understand each other and get along, but also because sex and gender are issues for everyone so getting it right on these topics really matters.  Keep up the good work!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Though I do think the main problems is that theres a basic difference in understanding, and it shows in the counter points of your video.

"I am fine with calling them 'gender critical.' In ten years, that will then be the 'slur' they rail against. Every euphemism they may choose will be tarnished by what it represents. The true stigma is not in the word, but in what it describes. The word TERF - a simple, value-neutral acronym (Trans-Exclusive Radical Feminist) that has picked up its unpleasant connotations by association - itself is an example of this process in action. The true insult to these individuals is what they believe. The people contaminated the word, not vice versa. Contrast 'gender critical' acronyms, deliberately designed to be insulting.   I have some sympathy for these people. Internalized misogyny is an awful thing to live with - many of these women have been at the other side of the very same ugly comments they subject trans women to. I just wish they could lash out against the people who instilled them with that disgust in the first place, instead of pushing it forward onto people more vulnerable than them.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

And while identity is not just a common group of people who have the same pain, it is for me, part of it. It is relieving to be around other people who truly understand what I've been through, even if the understanding is unspoken. Trans people go through their own kind of trauma, I'm sure, but it's not the same as the trauma of growing up as a girl, with all the bs that entails. I don't condone anyone acting on those bitter feelings or treating people poorly because of it- but I do sympathize with the sentiment. So of course all are welcome to my womanhood party- but I think I'll always still have that little twinge of bitterness in the back of my heart. Not that it's anyone's fault- just society's.

Then I realized it was so much harder for the trans woman and while her journey would be different the destination would be eventually the same. Also, I realized it was literally none of my concern if she had struggled exactly as I had and that oppression is not the only definition of what it is to be a woman and even ciswoman have gigantically different experience and yet we still have general solidarity and determined that supporting a new sister is far more important than my petty concerns about 'earning' womanhood through a theoretical standard female life struggle.

The ONLY way I can convince them, even momentarily, to treat trans people AS people is by telling them that trans people have female/male brains in a male/female body. While I totally agree with and support your viewpoint of gender dysphoria, it makes humanizing LGBT+ SO much harder and opens up transphobic comments like 'Well then a sexual predator can just 'decide' to be a woman and go assault actual women!'

Also, 40% of trans people attempt suicide and the rate skyrockets post reassignment surgery.  If that's not a blatant red flag for mental illness, then mental illness apparently doesn't exist.  So be yourself;  however, just realize once basic statistics and scientific fact enters the realm of your zone of argument, you will lose every time.  The far left aren't heroes for supporting trans kids.  They are simply the moral cowards pushing children toward suicide by telling them the lie that they can be anything they want.  In addition, lefties used to heavily mock Christianity for believing in creationism.  20 years later, the modern left has gone so far off the reservation of sanity that they think scientific fact is a state of mind and a feeling.

So, I always understood this term not as abolishing the female/male features of an individual (like what you interpreted as gender neutral clothes, hair, etc on the video), but more as erasing the social conventions used to oppress people through gender identity. For example, I would love a trans woman to be able to wear short hair and sweatpants while being treated with the same respect as any other human being, instead of her being preassured to look a certain way to pass as what society thinks a woman should be.

But I'm honestly so fucking relieved to have found this, and so grateful to you to have made it, that I just had to write a thank-you note, even accounting for the miniscule chance of you actually reading it.  The Trans /experience? movement? existence?/  has been a great cause of inner struggle for me. Like, having grown up in a fairly homophobic little Eastern European country, I have had some experience with discrimination. So to suddenly feel - not bigoted, but certainly not as empathetic and respectful as I should and want to be - was a source of constant unease. A part of why it took me so long to understand, I think, is because I know I would hate it if I was to be asked over and over again to justify my identity to anyone and everyone that doesn't get it. So - I never asked the members of the trans community. I get that it's up to me to educate myself, I do. It's just very hard to educate yourself about an experience someone is living, without either living it, or talking about it ad nauseam. Especially for a scientist, who is somewhat trained to only really respond to logical, well-argued points.  So - this was a godsend. Thank you again. You've made me a much happier person.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"a huge part of ''female socialization'' that dumb TERFs would never consider is: it depends on how your parents raise you!!   like, my dad always devalued 'feminine' stuff. (for example, my mom's friend owned a dance studio and he always liked to say that wasn't a real job, and that her husband who was a construction worker was the only one who had a real job in the family.)  he had me working on cars, woodworking, driving trucks with trailers, shopping at Menards, helping build houses and carrying heavy shit, basically just treating and socializing me like a typical dude. the only thing i didn't like was how i had to dress in big boots and baggy pants and old sweatshirts. sometimes he would even get my gender confused, i think...one time he said 'what would you do if you were a woman?'  i won't say this made me feel like i wasn't socialized as a woman AT ALL as a kid, b/c obviously he wasn't the only influence.  but it's naive to act like female socialization is this thing that happens in a universal way to all cis women, and trans women who transition at young age.  like, lol, tell me more about how all women are raised and socialized, TERFS.  TL;DR it's easy for a parent to raise their child according to the norms of the opposite gender (that the parent perceives the child as). not that that's the only sphere of socialization the child is exposed to, but it's certainly a big sphere.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think when they say you haven't experienced female opression they mean they haven't instilled all the insecurities that are put into little girl's brains that affects their confidence when they grow older into you. I think this is true, there was a TED talk of a transexual woman talking about those things, and saying how when someone mansplained something to her for the first time, she cut them off and told them 'I know that, that's not what I'm asking'. She has the confidence to say that because she was RAISED as a man, not as a woman. Most women usually don't cut people off when they do this because they're not raised to be confident and secure of themselves, they're raised to be quiet and 'Polite'.  Now does this mean you're not a 'real' woman? Of course not, and it's a ridiculous argument. I mean isn't that the goal at the end? That women don't have to grow up with this lack of confidence because of social norms and constructs? If somewhere in the world there is a woman who wasn't raised in a way that makes them loose their confidence and voice like it usually happens to women, does that mean they're no longer a woman? No. This opression is clinging itself onto womanhood, but it's not a part of it, luckily.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I'm not sure how it happened, but most of the 'YesAllWomen' events that define how women experience sexism skipped over me.

"Natalie, I support you through a lot, but this video definitely disappointed me. It disappointed me because saying that every radfem is a transphobic is only fueling the fire, it disappointed me because I've personally experienced social exclusion because of some of the question I've asked, it disappointed me because I wrote a very long, detailed e-mail to you explaining why I'm rad-leaning and why many of my trans friends are, too. I am disappointed because we live in a time where abortion laws are being banned and instead of talking about the misogyny behind that, we're worried about semantics and inclusivity. I am disappointed because you're using straw man arguments here and while I understand that a trans woman like you doesn't trust radfems online (neither do i, believe me i had terrible encounters), me and several of my friends wrote you an e-mail and you clearly didn't read them.  There is more nuance to this topic and I'm sad you wouldn't acknowledge that. You do realize that people literally telling lesbians that they need to be attracted to dick to validate trans womens identity is a thing? You do realize that there are some predatory people out there who use cotton ceiling rhetoric to pressure lesbians into sleeping with them? There are people like Eli Elrick (a trans woman) who has raped someone (a trans man) and who has made sure all of the evidence disappears. And these type of people have influence. I wished you would've taken a second glance at people who are radfems and who are not transphobic, there are enough of us out there. 'Radfem' is NOT a dogwhistle for transphobia. The person who invented the term 'TERF' was a RADFEM who wanted to distinguish between radfems and transphobic radfems. Like, please. Honestly.  1 Million views and you're not going to let someone like me speak up? Someone who is just exhausted by internet trans activism and wonders when it's going to be okay again to talk about misogyny that cis women face? Because we do feel like we're being silenced and I'm not saying that trans rights aren't important at all, but sex-based oppression is a thing and we shouldn't act like the growing number of radfems is just because people are assholes.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

So some of the arguments radfems make appeal to me, especially about heels + makeup being oppressive. I don't want to wear either but know full well from past experience that if I don't I'll be treated like s***. I hate performing femininity, but the reality is I have to if I want to get by. So is a choice you're bullied into making really a choice?  I agree that what Greer wrote was hateful + not just to trans people, plenty of non trans women have unfeminine body characteristics.

For example, the controversy of those two trans girls in Connecticut who were winning against the other girl (and gaining school scholarships due to it), because they started hormoning kind of late in their teens and so had more testosterone (meaning more muscle and power). What do you think about it? Should be a part of sports with only (trans) men and women?? Should they participate at the same category as their true gender (the one after transition)? The same happens for trans men, the lack of testosterone in the childhood leads to less muscle and is considered the testosterone they take as dopping??

"honestly, something that annoys me a lot about the ' the traumas of girlhood' thing is how it just ignores the huge variety in even cis women's experiences.  They talk about it as if there is one experience there, one set of traumas and that #s theirs and that's it.  And that's just divorced from reality and ignoring so so many other aspects that play into how womanhood affect a woman's life.  take race, location, religion,  culture,  income, sexuality, self-expression and even just their parents' political views. One cis woman's girlhood can be fucked up in a completely different way than theirs. the stuff forced onto women varies A LOT.    Like, my experience was being a well off girl in a place where my race was never an issue. I didn't get catcalled at 9 and I didn#t get forced into dresses. Actually, I was told that skirts and dresses and makeup where for brainless sluts looking to compensate, who were sure to end up poor and worthless. So I ended up tomboyish. Not out of actual preference but due to panicking and shaming myself whenever I felt like wearing a dress or something flowery and hiding that I tried on makeup until like 7th or 8th grade I think, at which point I said fuck you to the classism and the second-hand sexism of  judging anything feminine and embraced that I could wear a skirt without losing my worth as a human being.   That's pretty damn different from what most butch lesbians I've heard talk about this have described. and it's different from what friends that fit norms pretty well but that also lives in a  crime-riddled neighborhood  have told me  And I'm just gonna go ahead and assume that someone that was sold off to marry and have kids at 12 might have something else to say. That cis women  that went through genital mutilation will have something else to say too.  That  Women told by their religion to shut up  and be quiet will have a different story to tell. that women  that have their hijab ripped off their heads  in public against their will will have yet another.    The experiences are incredibly varied, in ways they often don't even consider in their narrow-minded narrative. so when another variant comes along they reject it instead of seeing that the experience is varied already. that the experiences of trans women might actually be closer to those of some other cis women than their own.    The sheer ignorance and self-centeredness of it baffles me","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I was a TERF myself for about a year.  You know what made me rethink the whole thing? They say that trans men are all lesbians that hate themselves. I noticed something was wrong when I saw a pattern, TERFS are mostly white middle class cis lesbians with conservative backgrounds. If they were straight men, their life would be close to perfect, therefore, they project what makes them less privileged (being lesbians) to trans people. Another TERF pattern is their connection to not only the second wave of feminism, but the first one too. The second one was not inclusive of trans women and the first one was not inclusive of black women, I don't think it's a coincidence that they are mostly white and mostly British.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Amazing video. I didn't realize how ingrained TERF language was even amongst more liberal pro-trans groups. Up until now, I believed that being trans was simply something that could be explained away with science, more specifically mutations and cross-over events regarding sexual determination genes and hormone imbalance. Not that those aren't still real things, but that being trans is too much of an umbrella statement. The realest answer is, 'who the fuck cares, let people live their life.' How people choose to express themselves is all about personal preference, and it should be common decency to just respect that. It isn't hard, and opposition to this idea is just you being a dickhead. Why anyone would take it as an issue how someone chooses to express themselves is beyond me. But I suppose that this opinion changes when it comes to children. How an adult chooses to express themselves is their choice because they are at an age where they can understand the weight of the decisions they are making, but kids are very shortsighted and impressionistic. I know my ideals have changed a lot between the age of 18-22. The idea that a child making an irreversible, life-altering decision like gender reassignment surgery scares me in the same way of a child hurting themselves due to body dysphoria. I want them to be ok. I realize that people use, 'but think of the children,' as a way to delegitimize trans people, but I really am honestly concerned with high suicide rates tied with body dysphoria. Someone getting improper body reassignment surgery would be akin to being assigned the wrong gender. I will continue to research what it means to be trans, and continue watching ContraPoints for all of her funny content, so I can be more informed and a better ally.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm looking at this video until now because I wasn't feeling ready to watch it before. I have considered myself as a radical feminist for a long time, in the way of believing that most of the oppressions women suffer are caused because of their biological characteristics. With this I don't mean that is like that all the time because patriarchy has taken this forms and applied them to all women and bodies that are read as female not specifically to the biological ones, but that biological characteristics are the root of that oppression and that it's still a relevant topic of discussion. I do believe that the debate about transgender issues and radical feminism can use this kind of arguments to belittle and make fun of transgender people (specially tansgenderwoman) but I find it fundamental to open this places of encounter and debate (obviously with people that really want to talk and, most importantly, listen).  And I think too that is important to remember that the struggles that women face are complete different all over the world and the specific vulnerabilities  that trans and biological women face in each context is different. In a personal way I can tell you that it is very difficult to understand why anyone would like to be a woman, I don't like being a woman and almost all my female friends don't like it either because in my country (Mexico) the violence against women is crazy and I feel womanhood as an everyday struggle, as a borden. For this reason I didn't understood transwomen but as I hear you speak and watch more of your videos I have undestood more from your context and in the same way begin to understand the ones in my own.  Thank you for opening this places of debate, we are at a time where we have to discus this topics (in a theoretical and personal way) to look for solutions against the brutal violence against women and misogyny in the world.

I look forward to the medical advancements that will allow transwomen or any gendered person to get pregnant and give births. I am interested in the constructed nature of our bodies! I personally am interested in liberation from gender, not in the sense of abolishing it, but that it is something that is a fluid choice that doesn't restrict people but helps them thrive.  But I totes agree with you that that is a utopian vision at the moment. Gay marriage bolsters the institution of marriage that has been faltering badly, if anything it infuses new blood into it. I feel that transwomen are embodying authentic womanhood, for me at least which has been losing meaning and faltering! I think transwomen are bringing hope to womanhood. I sometimes wonder if transwomen are able to  suggest a vision of true womanhood to the world.  And transmen a vision of true manhood, in a world where gender as an institution is failing us....

Of course, this it not the majority of transwomen, but I would've liked to see Natalie address that particular concern.

"Would it be possible to describe all this using universal neutral terms. Like instead of using the term misogyny, just use the term prejudice? I mean, when even the definition of woman is up for debate, there's a very long way to go, no? Is there any way to approach this from an objective point of view? It's very hard to separate the hypothesis' from the conclusions? I'm probably way off here, but my take is that all this comes down to the ideal of the inviolable individual. You know, treat others like you want to be treated, and so on? Surely the prejudice we need to confront is that within ourselves? And by confronting others about their prejudice, we almost certainly will only harden their prejudice? Does one violation justify another? I understand you feel threatened by this Germaine character's identity, either self proclaimed or assigned? And surely she feels threatened by your identity, either self proclaimed or assigned?

"As someone who is considered and considers himself a man, but also someone who grew up plagued by gender stereotypes that he never conformed to, I deeply appreciate this look into what goes on behind the TERF phenomenon. For me, the notion that gender is biological, and not social, is deeply comforting. If being a man is just to have a penis, then it's meaningless and anyone stereotyping me or criticizing me for just doing what feels natural to me, are projecting something irrational onto me. If what it is to be a man or a woman is a 'social construct' in the way people talk about it, then all the behaviors associated with masculinity are masculine by default. By taking ballet classes I'm in some way deviant now, instead of just acting according to what feels right to me. I'm now transgressing. And I don't want to transgress, I just want to be me. I'm not being feminine by taking ballet, I'm doing something that I enjoy. I'm not being feminine by having long hair, I'm doing something I enjoy. The fact that other people take that to be feminine is of no concern to me, because they're just projecting their own notions onto me.   But at the same time, everything Natalie has said in this video seems correct to me. These personal experiences of mine, along with the narratives I've used to cope with those experiences, don't undermine what's the issue, unrealistic and policed gender norms. Whether I agree with Natalie's underlying metaphysics of gender, (which I clearly don't) I still agree that her situation deserves to be taken seriously and sympathized with, along with other trans people. TERFs, along with others, are in danger of taking their own experiences too seriously and objectively. Seeing our experiences as valid, but only as one among many experiences, is crucially important. And I'm glad that this video exists to illuminate a divide.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's nice to hear someone actually answering those questions instead of just screaming 'you're transphobic you just dont get it you fucking TERF!!'  So thank you for that.   i considered myself a rad fem for 3 weeks because I didn't know there was other feminists who were thinking 'just like me' but then I got scared of the people in the movement but still had these questions in my head and didn't know what to really think. You are very smart and it's refreshing to hear someone who has actual thoughtful opinions.    I never disrespected trans people but I did think (and kind of still do) that the're reinforcing stereotypes by saying things like 'I used to play with barbies' and other irrelevant stuff to explain why they're women. Or hearing trans men say ' I was tired of people telling me that I couldn't do certain things because I'm a woman' . As a woman you feel kind of ''betrayed'' or 'disrespected' when hearing this sort of stuff. (which are actual quotes from trans people being interviewed).   Anyway, your video was very refreshing because you ackowledge the privilege you used to have and explain very well why you make a lot of effort to look like a 'typical' woman. I get it now, because as a black woman we are often seen as unattractive, unfeminine, and we often tend to compensate by going to extremes just to be perceived as feminine as white women who seem to have the luxury of being feminine just by being skinny and having long hair. SO I get it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"ContraPoints is so sophisticated and I love the outfits. Cis women have came a long way. Yes you can pick out data where women have unfair wages & sexual assault. You can also pick out data where men were pressured to risk their lives in the army or denied jobs because they were considered 'too intimidating'. I guess my point is I choose not to engage in conversation about privilege in association with gender & race. It makes the same stereotypes that often social justice warriors often fight when directing at their declared discriminated class.   If a straight white man is sexually harassed it equally angers me as if a black transgender woman experiences the sames thing. Obsessing on these classifications is low brow & non-intellectual.

"I would not say that I was on the fence of TERFdom ... but these questions have crossed my mind. Honestly, it started because of another of your videos. You mentioned big, strong, masculine women when discussing the construct of femininity and sort of said, 'right, because look at how great society views them.' As if to say, society treats them like shit and therefore that upholds certain dainty, willowy standards of femininity as more accurate. I fucking hated that. I embody powerful femininity as a very big and strong (cis) woman. I'm 6'9', 330 lbs. Its hard for me to see clearly around my ego in this, because I have become fiercely proud of my stature, partly as a defense against the way I've been treated my entire life. When I was 10 years old a bunch of hick dudes screamed at me from their pick up, 'hey bitch, you dropped your dick!' Thus began the public harassment from strangers that continues to this day (though I had plenty of 'private' harassment from peers at school starting before I can remember). I just don't like the idea that people in formerly male bodies (sorry if that is offensive, I'm not sure how else to say it) feel entitled to define femininity, when I have been shaped as a woman by men's responses to my body, which did not fit into their definition of femininity. Maybe we can relate in that way. But the difference is that you don't understand what its like to be undeniably a woman from birth and be told that you are still wrong as a woman, constantly, based on lifelong programming about what is expected of you. And then have someone who came into womanhood later in life and also lived as a boy or man in a world that caters to men's perspective, be in a position to tell you what the definition of femininity is. This is what might be missing from your definition of femininity. Idk, I have to go watch that video again now.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Not to say I haven't had intense encounters with homophobia: I was nearly kidnapped to be harmed/killed by an older classmate, and later on in life had a gun pointed at me. But those were exceptions to the rule. I just never felt particularly miserable by my experience. Most of my worries are about people hundreds of miles away influencing me through policy, and that diodn't even hit home until I fully matured around 25 and started thinking beyond my immediate sphere of awareness.

"I am a Christian, and I Love your channel because it is very helpful in understanding the perspective, pleasures and pains of people who identify in a trans manner. The reason other Christians and the many anti-LGBT non-Christians, hate LGBT people, is because they don't see that you're a real person worthy of love.   This may further be because they themselves, according to their particular interpretation of Christianity and/or Life, see themselves as ultimately unworthy of love, dissociating from all humanity, failing to recognize that Jesus was not a ruler to eternally fail to compare ourselves to, but a savior in whom we can rejoice and likewise accept all of mankind in sincere friendship. They project their own 'I'm not good enough.' onto you, ignoring your own.  I especially appreciate your honest and potent manner of expression.

"This has added more to think about as I go through my own journey of gender identity that I struggle with.  For example what you said about some trans thinking that you are only valid as a trans person if you have experienced agonizing hatred of your body.  While it is true that I have often hated my body and the extreme maleness of it, there have also been times of peaceful acceptance of that same body.  The fact that I have at times in my life comfortably accepted and even enjoyed a male identity has also made me feel now like a fraud.  How can I even consider that I am trans when I still use he/him pronouns and live and identify as a man?  How can I say I feel this way now when I was so eager to fulfill male gender roles in my 20s?  I look at young transwomen with beard stubble and wigs and imagine their gender dysphoria must be much worse than mine to feel more comfortable dressed like that and to be side-eyed by everyone around them.  Maybe my trans feelings are less valid because I always put on pants and polo shirts and cut my hair short to fit in with those around me, to desperately seem normal, to seem as male as possible.  To realize now, though, that those thoughts and concerns are what are actually invalid has been inspiring.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Male feminist here. I was admittedly a TERF before I even knew what it was. Not because I indulged in privilege oppression framing (something I still don't think is helpful). But I saw male socialization in a lot of my transwomen friends coming out. I saw it making many of my female (and especially lesbian) friends uncomfortable, and it admittedly made me uncomfortable as well. It took a while to integrate the difference between personal discomfort and feminist ideology around a trans identity.  In a book I'm writing, I'm considering the impact of male and female socializion in how genders approach the issue of consent. It's a very difficult framework I'm trying to develop, not the least of because of my own limited experience as a male. I've been doing as much research as possible (and of course have a female coauthor), but the male socialization issue has always been bugging me in the back of my mind even though I no longer could be considered a TERF.

"Thank you, but THANK. YOU. for the bit about social constructs because  I don't think it means what the internet thinks it means! Plenty of things are not set in stone yet necessary. Their entire meaning depends on the context; Language for example: there is no scientific reason why the letter 'A' means the sound we associate with it, we just collectively agreed that it does in this time and place to communicate better. In China or Egypt centuries ago, the same sound was written differently. It's the same with many other things; art, cooking (jews don't eat pork, westerners don't eat insects yet neither are poisonous) religion (abrahamic or not, organized or not), gender roles are all products of our social psychology. That being said, we must keep in mind that those rules were invented by and for humans, not humans for those rules. They have changed in the past, and will change again... ...and when people are being killed and bullied just because their tangible existence does not fit those abstract concepts of gender, for example, it is better to believe our own eyes and adapt.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Since there was nobody like ContraPoints back in the day, I had to figure most of it out myself through logic, or make trans friends who happened to discuss their experience. It's important to know because it helps ciswomen stand in solidarity with transwomen and be better allies. Also..it's just important to hear transwomen talk about their thoughts and experiences.

"Beautiful video. I think masculinity and femininity are so powerful and when balanced it's just amazing. Why would we hate people who have so many gifts and potentials to share? Hmm. Human-phobia? Although what I do relate to as a straight woman is feeling constantly treated as a commodity or prize to win or proof of something by men, lesbians and trans women. Our humanity as girls is taken from us and then it just seems harder and harder to get it back. It's like quick sand. So there's always the jealousy of male privilege. For cis women feminity feels like all we have. And if trans women have femininity and some male privilege from early life then it feels unfair. But to me if someone can be more uplifted then they will show me how to be that way too so why would I stay divided from them.

GENDER dysphoria, however, most definitely is.  i hope this was informative.  EDIT: i recognize that there are many problematic people within the transmed community. the individuals who harass and misgender others absolutely do not speak for us. most transmeds you will meet will respect your identity and will not expect you to fill any kind of mold, as we recognize that gender roles are mostly arbitrary. most transmeds you will meet will hate terfs. most transmeds you will meet will only define their beliefs as what i described here (ie a disconnect, not distress.) most transmeds you will meet respect nb people. the shitty ones dont speak for us.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Paused to react at 20:58    I learned about transsexual people, re: transgender now, in the 90s and early 00s, watching HBO when I shouldn't have.    Regardless, I know that I have felt attraction to a trans person and have many friends who make no bones about who they bone. To me, the points on typical male sexuality, as presented here, shows that they are bro-like in nature - largely true, but I've noticed a schism from the mainstream opinion on this, from my younger friends, in the Bible Belt to where they are attracted to the person, rather than certain gender signals.    True intimacy - the kind to have a fundamentally profound effect on the people involved - is, in itself, gender-less, so I understand the issue (issue meaning how someone could or could not be attracted to a trans person) to that point, but being open minded to people as individuals and specific about how you express love is the deeper issue at hand. I tend to get lost in generalities, because they often have an implications that I'm unaware of, but this gender non-conforming (to borrow a term) part of cis-male sexuality is often omitted in these 'in defense of...' conversations. Yes, I am attracted to women, but is it because they are women or because they present as women? I've asked myself this question and many others like that, finding that I'm a lot more open to things when I take the time to figure them out, or at least come to an understanding.    My actual question to you would be, do think that you and other trans people (not to be too general here) will have an easier time dating or being seen as possible paramours to people at large in the future? A follow-up, if someone where attracted to a trans person, how could they reasonably distinguish true attraction or close to as possible, and not merely as adherence to fetishistic tendencies?   Honestly, I have trouble doing both of these when it comes to a relationship with a bio-woman (how the fuck does any of it work there?!), meaning the differences are massive, but the thing that has bound me to those 'people', rather than 'women', would be the thing that reflected back to me about myself something that made them happy. Example: holding me to my word knowing that I want to be doing that for myself, but sometimes need a hand in achieving. Very vague and loss terminology there, but I think you'll understand the intimacy to which I'm referring.   Appreciate any words in response.    P.S. - I think your tits looked great.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I respect the effort but she resorted to dogma. Also telling men they have no place in these conversations is garbage. Gender and sexuality issues can't be lead by a ideology centered on one sex/gender identity aligned with that sex. If men can transition to women or other gender identities then men too have a place in the conversation about gender identities regardless of how they choose to identify.   The gate keeping BS needs to stop. It's a authoritarian power play by people who want to tell people how to think and feel without having to bother with dissent. Dissent may not feel good but making people feel good isn't the end all be all when trying to make a just society. Get comfortable being uncomfortable. That's what the activists keep telling everyone else.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The transphobia present in so much radical feminist writing has always puzzled me, because when I was just starting out examining the world-view with which I had been raised (Fundamental Christianity/Reactionary conservatism) reading radfem/second-wave theory helped me grok transphobia and I came to many of the same conclusions you argue for in your video. The stuff I read didn't really talk about transwomen specifically, but it wasn't hard to see that restrictive gender and sexual roles meant that a transwoman who felt most authentically herself when not wearing makeup or stereotypically feminine clothing basically had no way to take on the 'woman' social role without sacrificing something about herself. I thought it would be totally natural for transpeople and rad-fems who wanted to do away with gender roles entirely to be staunch allies. Then I started lurking on radfem forums and message boards and was completely flabbergasted that the people who had most influenced me to become less transphobic at first were saying horrible things about transwomen!  Anyways, what I'm really saying Ms. Wynn, is thank you for putting into words things that I've turned over in my head for a long time but struggled to express.  Also: Your inner-radfem is a shitheel but she has amazing style. I want that hat.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Natalie is clearly on to something in the feminist gender critical sub Reddit. That something is a visceral reptile brain hatred of men. That hatred surely has its provenance in all sorts of lived experiences of real women...but it is hatred non the less, and it is good to call it what it is. And right wing 4chan ridicule on the other side? That has some visceral hatred of women going on mutatis mutandis style. True enough. The MISSING bit in all this? Clearly, no primary concern for the welfare of trans people themselves. So. Just hatred on all sides right Natalie? Eeeeeeeyeaaaahweeeelllnnonotreally. Where there IS proper concern for the health of trans people there are other things to think about. Those things include properly critical questions about the utility of powerful drugs and irrevocable surgery. Those concerns can be expressed in harsh terms. Yeah.

"But does gender really exist?  If it does does it exist as a feeling?  I am biologically male and I have always been conflicted about the expectations society has put upon me because of my male body/appearance.  I have no say, either i conform and feel non-conflicted or I don't conform and feel conflicted.  Perhaps gender is just the expectation put upon me by society based on my body.  So then gender is partly intrinsic and partly social construction - one that it seems I cannot escape from because it is socially constructed from something that is biologically real - my body.  But we can either make peace with the societal responsibilities of our sexed bodies or just accept that our body does not define us and we are not defined by it.  I have never regretted having my body.  I just dislike the rigid expectations that society places on my body.  I resist being expected to do anything that I have not freely chosen.  So, to me it is not the body that is the problem, it is an overly rigid society that that creates the conflict.  So, don't change your body, change society, or change your internalisation of society's expectations.   Be stronger and rise above society, don't feel you have to change your body to fit gender roles that do not coincide with your body.  Just be who you are regardless of your body.  I have never felt male or female,  I just exist in the body i was given.  Expectations exist.  But don't let them define you.  Define yourself.    Trans people say they experience dysphoria - a deep unease with their body that they say can only be overcome by physically transitioning or embodying the opposite sex.  But is this really true? (I of course cannot ever truly know because I have not experienced it, but nonetheless I think the question is worth asking).  I wonder if the dysphoria is not just a defense mechanism against the conflict of not conforming to the expectation placed upon one's body.  One then begins to despise one's body rather than the expectation itself.  This is further enhanced when we are told that gender is a real identifiable intrinsic identity.  It isn't.  It is something we can create in our heads.  All identities are.  There are no identities.  I have a male body but I am not male.  Male is just a word, a label for something that is real - my body.  And I am not even my body,  I just exist within it.  I am not even an I.    Is transgenderism just  neurosis then?  A sophisticated sort of neurosis?  A serious problem of identity?  Which we are told can only be solved with more identity.  But what if Identity is the problem?  Changing identity is not going to solve the problem of feeling that there is something wrong with your identity.  The healthiest thing to do is realise there is no identity and just live with the reality that you have.  This of course is not easy when society imposes its will upon you.  But fuck society.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

A racist also belives that race is a real thing, usually without any data to back it up with and values people differently, according to certain qualities he asigns to these races. So the first thing is a politically neutral stance, that can be an interesting factor, when looking at anthroplogy, history and stuff like that, the latter is clearly a right wing policy, that values people differently from the time of their birth.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Your genitals at birth do not determine what life you can live... It's called being your own person despite what others think. Sure, you can be killed, hurt, spat on by stupid people, but that doesn't mean you HAVE to live a certain way. Your genitals tell you if you are male, female, or intersex (which there are 4 variations of, all either having one dominate functioning sex organ, or none, to which it doesn't matter, because you probably look like either a male or female, can can do whatever you want). You cannot TRANSITION from one sex to another; it is impossible. What you can do is live your life how you see fit. People shouldn't be shunned for being different, though, I would never humiliate someone who decides to dress a certain way. I take a stance against you requiring others to conform to your understanding of gender, which is biologically wrong in humans.

"As a ciswoman, here's what I say about transfemininity if asked for my $0.02: You are a woman if that's how you identify. You and I are not the same kind of woman and never will be, and that's ok. There are different ways of being a woman and you create your own womanhood. If you're looking to have the same cultural/societal experience of womanhood that I (as a ciswoman) do, prepare to be disappointed, because biology is like, an actual thing that majorly informs cultural/societal experience, regardless of gender identity (#unpopulartruth... that goes for any and every human, by the way... no one is immune to biological truth or cultural/societal realities, neither of which care about gender identity or dysphoria). Do our differences in womanhood make you less valid or somehow unequal? No. Should our differences in womanhood be ignored? Also no. We can't all be the same, nor should we try. To sum it up, transfeminine women will never be the same as ciswomen, and that shouldn't be perceived negatively because it isn't a negative thing, and there are so many ways to be a woman so now it's up to our cultures/societies to make space for transpeople.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I have always felt very strongly that people should love and accept themselves for who they are and that you should never buy into the belief that thier is something wrong with the way you were born (aka 'God makes no mistakes'). For this reason trans people conflict with my personal philosophy. If I had a child who was trans I would try had to raise them to believe they can be whatever they want. A feminine man or a masculine woman but that thier is nothing wrong with the body they were given. Ideally they would learn to love and accept themselves without the need to take medication or have surgery to alter thier body. But I never bring this up with trans people I assume they will disagree and their lives are difficult enough without having to field questions from me. And it is unreasonable to expect people to live thier lives in accordance with my own personal philosophy. They dont owe me an explanation I just use whatever pronouns they want me to, treat them with kindess, and keep my thoughts to myself.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I hit peak trans after discovering how deeply misogyny underpins my friends' genderspecial identities.   Some context: These (all female) friends would, in a simpler time, just be called nerds. They're a little socially weird. They're not necessarily interested in conventional beauty standards and not romantically confident. A handful are bisexual but torn about pursuing women. (Which, as a lesbian, I fully get and don't want to dismiss.)   All of this has combined into pure, uncut old-school misogyny. Some examples:   * Being nonbinary is just 'not like other girls' on steroids, right? Because my friends who identify that way insist that they don't like lipstick and \[insert stereotyped-as-frivolous piece of media here\] and that's how they Knew All Along that their gender identity was different.     * Any woman they admire is automatically 'butch' or 'gender nonconforming' or 'they/them' in their eyes. A lawyer in a skirt-suit with flowing hair and lipstick? Gender non-conforming bc she goes to court. A figure skater? Butch, because look at her muscles. It's like womanhood is only weakness, incompetence, and passivity in their view.     * 'She won't date me because I'm trans,' has become a really useful weapon. Suddenly, the pretty straight girls aren't just... straight. They're vile, toxic, abusive monsters, oppressing smol soft trans bois.     * In a frankly jaw-dropping conversation, a couple of them insisted that unwanted pregnancy is a horror unique to trans men because of the attendant dysphoria. What about women with no access to reproductive healthcare, you may ask? Eh, they're probably fine with it. Because having a fetus you don't want take over your body for nine months wouldn't provoke any complicated feelings, no ma'am.   Thankfully, I've never experienced physical violence or social ostracism from the trans community. My story is much less dire than many in these threads. But it's just so fucking exhausting and demoralizing to see young women hate themselves and other women, with an entire echo chamber of support around them.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Even if this person she encountered was, say, an overstepping drag queen, it still stands to reason that any prominent feminist voice worth its salt is inevitably doing something for the acceptance of femininity, and thus reducing the perceived lowering of male worth upon adoption of femininity.

"I am someone who's been kind of on the fence, but I'm at least glad you're individually addressing the concerns of radfems, even if I largely disagree with your video. But I wish people would stop characterizing all radfems (or people who are questioning) as only hating trans people under the guise of feminism-- speaking for both myself and many I have met, we are actually genuinely open to a dialogue and to even have our minds changed if you convince us (speaking mostly for people leaning that way, anyway). I know there's way too many that unfortunately just don't care about feminism and just spend time hating trans people and triggering their dysphoria, and that's not cool. But the portrayal of all radfems as man-haters who want trans people dead has only driven me further towards their side tbh, because it's so rare for me to see people actually engage them head-on without resorting to insults or chants. This channel actually does a pretty good job of addressing the arguments of white nationalists and alt-righters, so it would be nice to see someone at least tackle the concerns of radfems instead of attacking a strawman depiction. This vid is at least kinda doing that though, better than previous videos. I'm especially glad you acknowledged the male socialization bit. Very few trans activists gave a satisfactory answer for that one, but I'll think hard about this video.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I forever will love all of your videos, and I do love this one, but I would disagree that all gender critical people are TERFs. I call myself 'Gender Critical' because I am critical of how we as a society view gender and gender roles, on men and women, trans people and cis people - as someone who used to identify as agender due to pressures put on me in a period of my life by certain individuals who had an issue with my lack of desire to present and express myself in a feminine way. I walk in a lot 'trans medicalist' spaces and 'gender critical' spaces (they're often the same spaces, as they share a lot - but not all - of the same views of the world) because those are the only places where I feel like I can have discussions about my experience with gender and sex as a system of oppression without being pulled into the 'internet shaming session of the week.' (as of writing this comment , I have been doxed twice.)  While I do see a lot of TERFs in those spaces, that is certainly not a term that I would use to describe all of us. I'm in a Transmed/Gender Critical Facebook group, and we do not suffer the TERFs (let the almighty banhammer rain down upon them), but we spend a lot of time analyzing gender from a critical viewpoint, including how gender roles develop different through culture and customs. I just wish that there were other places that I could have those discussions without fearing for my safety.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm really happy you talked about the socialization / privilege thing with nuance.  I'm a non-binary afab person, and although generally, I have some space to talk about what I have with being afab, I feel that it's more difficult when friends I have who are on the mtf spectrum to talk about it. I think we're a bit too obsessed in SJ with categorisation and creating a oppression hierarchy, when it's not that simple?   My Grannie is a cis lesbian born in 1940, one of the people in her community of elder queers, was a trans woman from the same area born in the same time. My grannie had her education while a single mother, her friend got her education directly after high school, and did not have the same level of poverty. It's fair to say that in a way, the fact that as a young adult she was able to go to university, when my grannie had to get married and have children was a result of her 'male privilege' In 1950's Canada, it's pretty clear that being presented as a man made education more attenable.   On the other hand this same difference can be in situations where there isn't a privelege to attribute it to. My brother is a straight cis man, and I'm a Queer, We have different fathers, his was a drug addict white supremacist, and mine was a drug addict ambiguous race francophone. Other than the age at which our mum was when we were had, my brother out privileges me. Yet he is currently attending his postgrad while going through a separation, and with two kids, and started his undergrad with one of those kids, while working full time. I'm in university not directly out of high school due to medical issues, but I've never had to work, I'm living on campus, my only responsibilities are to attend class and remember to eat (and not die, literally my mum's only rule for me is to not die). This is because my mum is in a better financial position, being the youngest child, my mum can work and has no other responsibilities so it's much easier for her to afford my tuition and housing. Also because of my medical situation I get more grants than my brother could have. I am the same as my Grannie's friend to my brother.  And I think that creates an issue because people need to be allowed to feel that difference.  My grannie's friend has no issue with their relationship, they are very close, and they both agree that for the most part her friend got more opporotunities as a child, but my grannie faces fewer issues in their current circumstance.   But people of my generation think, but she believes in male privilege for trans women so she's a TERF. Which she's not. It's frustrating on one end I think for intergrenerational co-operation in the queer community, I think that buy and large, people in my grannie's generation are a lot more likely to be in a situation where their 'male socialisation' has materially benefited them than those in my generation, on the other hand, people in my generation are able to come out at 13 and maybe that's a privelege of time.   But I think what's more important, is that we try and put away the hierarchy and accept what people's personal struggles are. And not everyone will have the same ones. I don't have the same struggles as my brother or my mum or my grannie, and at some point you have to just let people say, well that doesn't really apply to me, but we don't need to compare, I'm sure that was difficult and although my experiences are different I know the general feeling you're describing.   I don't know what it's like to be denied education based on my gender, but my grannie does, and my grannie doesn't know what it's like to have a doctor misgender her, but I do. And that's a lot more how it is than some hierarchy of oppression.  P.S. feel free to ask clarifying questions it's 9am and I didn't sleep all night so this might be a bit hard to parse.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I really love this video! <3  I am a cisgender female feminist and I am a bit surprised that I agree with you on...well EVERYTHING you said here.  I don't believe in female and male brains, female or male souls and I wish we could just stop gender everything. But that doesn't mean I don't believe in gender as a psychological and sociological concept which is very real.  The identity of a person is formed in the early childhood (this includes the sexual identity). And because we human are very complex creatures we don't evolve always as expected or wished.  When someone with a female body can evolve a female gender so can someone with a male body and the other way around. Both is real and valid.  And just because there are differences between trans and cis women doesn't mean some of them aren't 'real women'. Everyone has their own experiences. And trans women suffer a lot under discrimination and bullying, to say otherwise is just wrong and ignorant. I hope more cisgender people think about that and come to the conclusion that gender is not necesserily linked to the biological sex.  I don't know how it is to be trans but I am very empathic. It's not hard to see the struggles trans people have in our society. I also have DID (dissociative identity disorder also known as multible identity disorder) and some male alters. Of couse it is not the same (not even close!) to being trans but still I have to accept that my mind formed male personalities in a female body. I think this is fascinating and it also made me think about gender a lot.  I am angry about these 'terfs' because they call themselves feminists but all they do is divide us women from each other. And I don't get why they refuse to believe in the concept of sex and gender. They believe only in biological sexes which makes them more comparable to the mysogynists in the 19. centurary then to feminism in general.   In this case: make sisters, not cisters!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Gender critical feminist here (dont call myself a radical feminist because I dont agree with radical feminism on several points):  Gender metaphysics:    You've failed to address the reason why we even need gender metaphysics. How can we measure or discuss discrimination against women if anyone who feels like a woman is a woman? There are many trans people who identify as one gender but are read as, and therefore treated as, the opposite gender by the majority of people they encounter. Do you think that those girls and women who are forced to sleep in huts when they're menstruating could just declare 'actually, I'm a man' and be allowed to sleep in their beds?  Also, its medically necessary to differentiate between male and female humans. Certain diseases present differently in men and women, autism is one example. Only women need cervical smears and only men need prostate exams. There are very glaringly obvious differences in the anatomy of men and women. Your definition of 'woman' makes that extremely difficult to talk about. Your concept of gender seems completely pointless and seems to serve no useful purpose in society, so it seems to me it would be better to define 'man' as 'adult human male' and 'woman' as 'adult human female' so that we can use these words to describe meaningful categories of people for sociological and biological purposes.  Gender stereotypes:  While I'm very glad that you understand womanhood isn't related to femininity, but I've never actually heard a trans person describe what it is that they identify with besides gender stereotypes. That's probably because the idea of having an internal 'gender identity' is bullshit. I have absolutely no idea how it feels to be a man or how any of the men that I know feel about being a man, so how could I possibly say that I 'identify' as a man. What could I possibly being identifying with?  I actually used to identify as non-binary between the ages of 19 and 20 because I used to hear transwomen talking all the time about this strong gender identity that they felt and I just don't have that feeling. I thought that the way I felt about myself must be different to how women feel, therefore I must not be a woman. Then I realised that they way I feel about myself as a woman may well be very similar to how lots of other women feel. I realised I was being incredibly self absorbed in thinking that I wasn't like any other women so therefore I must not be a woman. Luckily, I grew out of it and realised that I am an adult human female and I may as well call myself a woman for clarity, but that my 'gender identity' is such a wishy-washy concept, and a concept that has so little use to anyone, including myself, that I should just stop worrying about it. I see so many people on youtube and tumblr who spend so much of their lives thinking about their gender identity and I just want to shake them and tell them to snap out of it.  Abolish gender:  Bodies are not 'gendered', bodies have a sex. Having a penis or having boobs are not gender stereotypes, they are biological markers. Same with voice pitch. Men have bigger larynges. You make a video addressing gender critical feminist arguments but you can't even seem to differentiate between sex and gender. If you want to argue that sex and gender are the same, then you should have made a case for it in your video, because you're addressing a group of people who believe that gender and sex are not the same. This really takes away from the persuasiveness of your arguments.   Also, radical feminists are absolutely critical of female celebrities who pander to the male gaze, encourage men to objectify them to make money, and then claim its empowering, including Kim Kardashian.  Male privilege:   I will concede that there is an annoying subset of feminists (of all schools of thought) who act like they're the most oppressed ever because they're women even though they're middle class and white. (There is a similar set of middle class white gay men). These types of people tend to be very ignorant of the experiences of other people. I will also concede that you yourself are probably treated by others as either a woman, or as a gender non conforming man. Gender non conforming people (including butch women, effeminate men, and trans people) face their own set of struggles and it would be stupid to argue that transwomen benefit from some sort of privilege IF they're wearing a dress and make up.  However, using your definition as a transwoman as 'anyone who identifies as a woman or wants to be a woman', not all transwomen are going to look like women or like gender non conforming men. Some of them are just going to look like men, complete with suits and ties, balding heads and beards, but because they internally identify as women, they are women, according to you. These transwomen absolutely benefit from male privilege.  This is where transgender theory creates a catch 22 for itself. If you say that any person who has some internal subjective feeling that they are a women is a woman, then you have argued that some women can benefit from male privilege. If you say that transwomen have to be doing something to attempt to look feminine, then you have resorted to gender stereotypes.  Male Socialisation:  I agree with you here but I will emphasis your point that many vocal transgender activists do not agree with you, so its still a very valid concern for gender critical feminists to raise. I have heard people argue that even Bruce Jenner was always a woman and therefore never experienced male socialisation or male privilege. Also, pointing out that women 'don't know what its like' to be trans is further proof that transwomen are not women, but are instead a separate group of people with their own struggles and oppression. There are some overlaps, but they're not the same and they don't stem from the same place.   Reproductive Oppression/Erasing female language:  Unfortunately, many trans activists get angry when women frame reproductive oppression as a women's rights issue because its 'cisnormative' or even 'white feminism' to do so (whatever that means). There were transwomen who were upset that women at the womens march wore 'pussy hats' for example. Reproduction isnt something that every women goes through, nor is it something that every woman views in the same way, but abortion, child birth, unwanted pregnancies etc are things that only women go through, and therefore women's rights movements should be allowed to centre these issues in their activism without push back from trans people.   TERF is a slur:  I dont really care if someone wants to call me a terf since I genuinely do hold beliefs that are 'transphobic', TERF is thrown around to silence women who have any concerns at all about where we are going as a society in terms of acceptable discourse about gender and sex, and it is exclusively used towards women. Also, the whole 'this word is violent' bit is complete projection, its usually trans people who are claiming that referring to someone as the wrong thing is violence. I do agree with you that a lot of radical feminists use terms that are dehumanising (like referring to a person as 'it'), or deliberately mean and hurtful and I don't think that is particularly helpful so I don't do that myself.  Conclusion:   I actually decided to stop using tumblr altogether because the transwomen and the radical feminists on their were pretty ridiculous. However, there are actually genuine feminists with genuine feminist concerns regarding many issues, one of which is transgenderism. These women dont spend their time on r/gendercritical. I decided to stop using tumblr because it was actually colouring my view of transwomen in a very negative way. It is difficult to receive multiple graphic rape threats from transwomen on tumblr and not let that influence your opinion. I would suggest you stop trying to reason with the 'terfs' you are describing as just disgusted transphobes in disguise, and start appreciating that there absolutely are valid feminist concerns with the trans movement.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The part at the end where you discuss your own disgust at yourself and how it had you clock that transgender woman hit close to home with me, as in recent years I finally came to terms with being asexual. For the longest time I fought so hard against it (as far as to try and convince other asexuals that asexuality simply didn't exist) because I thought that there might be a 'solution' for me and everyone identifying as asexual, and that we were simply sexually/emotionally hurt people with low self-esteems and a phobia towards intimacy, or perhaps people who had some sort of of physiological problem that prevented us from sexuality.   It took a lot of soul-searching and analysis of myself to come to the realization that I might've simply come at the issue from a wrong perspective, and that my own concerns with intimacy might've been a *result* of my asexuality and the effects I feared it would have on the relationships I *did* want to establish, rather than my fear of intimacy leading to me 'feeling' asexual as a ways to protecting myself from hurt, and as an 'older' guy in his mid-twenties (when compared with how online most asexuals discussing the issue tend to be younger) I still feel some guilt for that.   Now I don't concern myself so much with whether or not asexuality is 'real' in the way people want it to be confirmed as real. I simply find it to be a valid label that doesn't invalidate me or tag me as ill, sick or psychologically damaged, and it gives me the happiness of knowing that there are other people out there like me who are still valid and yearn for the same things as me, even if the asexual community is still confused and mostly unexplored.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Como dijo Benito Juarez: 'el respeto al derecho ajeno, es la paz'   I think that the problem is that we have the need to put everything into a concept, we are brings of ideas, and if those ideas aren't what we believe, we get defensive, hateful, mad.

"@ContraPoints Thanks so much for your informative videos. As a former borderline TERF myself, I've learned a lot from listening to you and other trans people. I do have one concern (that I know many others have as well), and I'd like to hear your perspective on this: medical intervention (such as HRT or SRS) on people under the age of 18. I keep seeing the argument that some kids who feel trans might 'grow out of it' when they hit puberty and accept their birth-assigned gender. What do you think? When do you think people can start with medical intervention? Should that even be an option or not? What are the pros and cons (also in the context of 'regret' or 'detransitioning')?

I dont experience pain, dysphoria, but I deeply want to be nonbinary. You were ready to transition into society's hatred, and I still am not. This is where trans and nonbinary people have solidarity. Society doesnt like people who are not clearly one or the other. But tbh, I had a lot of the questions TERFs had. Because as an enby, I dont wish to pass for female or male. I want to live in this in between place where I am both and neither, and that's where I cant relate to trans experiences, but I dont relate to RadFem experiences either. And finally you expressed why feminists and queers everywhere rally behind powerful trans women and people in drag. That regal posture in the face of the most deplorable treatment, that your nonconforming regality can remain untouched. It is my favorite trope to see in media, a posture so regal that lizard brain concerns dont touch them.

"I'm not sure that the word 'pride' really applies to the feelings that motivate TERFs, but perhaps I'm being too generous in my interpretation of their perspective. Growing up as a cis-woman is almost without exception a painful experience, and finding your way into feminism can be incredibly liberating in that suddenly your status as a woman can be something revolutionary rather than a sign that you are 'other' or inferior to men. That can (unfortunately) lead to the feeling that one's womanhood is a precious, vulnerable thing that must be viciously defended from the rest of the world. Because without the idea that women are always and only united by shared injury comes the implication that you may lose the only source of unity and strength that you have found within an identity that has been forced upon you by society.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"thanks for this video! Only one question remains for me: WHY is gender such a big thing? Can you tell me why the female gender is appealing at all to you? Why all the fuzz? This is one thing I dont understand, no matter if I talk to feminists or transpeolple. I never experienced what feminists call patriarchy, eventhough I was really trying hard to understand and  to see it, I can not relate to other womans experiences. I dont think things are so different here in germany. I also dont understand why its so important to identify as any gender and then cling to those stereotypes. Well, genderstereotypes ARE social realiity and are a part of the world we live in, so you have to deal with them. IMO there is no need to abandon them as long as there are equal rights, but I also dont care if they vanish or change to the opposite, if there are 100 genders or if there will onetime be only one or whatever. And I understand that it must be very hard for transpeople to be confronted with a social reality that is hostile to them. But what I dont understand: If concrete gendernorms are historically variable and have such an enourmous negative influence over transpeoples lifes, is getting into them (sometimes in extremes) not only social pressure? Or expressing a socialiced schema of somethig one idealized because of the the negative experiences because not beeing able to idetify with the sex you had to live with?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Brains have a spectrum of sex correlating traits, it isn't black or white either. People are people, let them be themselves.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I wouldn't cosign any other beliefs that come with mental illness so the only argument I see for entertaining it is out of politeness and to avoid the awkwardness of going back and forth.   The idea of getting people without disorders to accept the reality of an individual who can't help feeling a way and can't accept their own reality is crazy to me.

In reality, the majority of transmedicalists recognise that not every trans person faces constant, heavy dysphoria, and also that in most cases, dysphoria can fluctuate wildly. Transmedicalism simply asserts that someone must experience dysphoria in some capacity in order to be trans.  Anyway, I love your videos!

"Apologies in advance for starting this comment by obnoxiously stating my gender, but I am a cis woman and honestly the TERF notion that you can only be a woman if you have a uterus that sheds its bloody skin every month (like some kind of haemophilic lizard that's hyper fixated on moon cycles) is offensive to me too. As far as I know, I don't have any issues in regards to my fertility (that's right, form a queue boys) but that's besides the point - I don't appreciate that my entire experience as a woman is apparently reduced down to the status of my womb. The whole point of feminism is de-politicising my body so that there are no social stigmas attached to it. The only reason my womb should be acknowledged is so I can receive medical and sanitary support for my female bodily functions at no extra cost (or at least, I shouldn't have to pay any more than a man would for gender-specific needs).   Also from a medical perspective, it's ridiculous to claim that all trans women are biologically male when many of them are taking female hormones which, shock horror, means that they need largely the same medical attention a woman would.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Okay, this is the perfect place for me to make my argument in hopes that its wrong. So, I dont believe that gender and sex are different concepts, but before I explain why, I must make this clear. I AM ALL FOR SELF EXPRESSION. I THINK MEN WEARING SKIRTS AND MAKEUP IS GREAT AND IT BREAKS GENDER NORMS. SAME FOR ANY OTHER WAY MEN OR WOMEN CAN DEFY WHAT IT MEANS TO BE MALE/FEMALE.  Now, what I need to bend my belief that gender isnt sex is simple. I need -a concrete definition of male and female -a concrete definition of gender -the lgbtq community to invent a word to refer to people with penises and likewise for people with the other sex parts  Ive tried to construct definitions for male and female, but theres a problem with each one that I can not ignore. Ill list the possible definitions for male (that I can think of) now. Keep in mind theres a similar definition for the other gender as well in each case.  -male=someone who identifies as male problem: this isnt saying anything. If this is the definition for male, then the definition of female is someone who identifies as female, and in that case, theyre interchangable and theres no fundamental difference between men and women so the words may as well not exist  -male=typically masculine person. Theyre tough, manly, courageous, they drink beer, watch football, etc problem: this is sexist (as far as im aware, genderist isnt a real word, so wed need terms to describe bigots for sexes and genders if theyre different too). If sex and gender are different, then people should be able to identify as a gender regardless of their personality traits. Im a guy, and I dont fit the typical male image in the slightest, to say that im less of a man or not a man at all because of that is insulting!  -male=its subjective to each person. People can be whatever gender they want and define gender to whatever suits them. problem: thats kinda stupid. We need an identical understanding of what gender is on a societal level if were all going to be on the same page here. Whats stopping me from viewing someone else as a gender they dont identify as? This definition doesnt entail that you cant misgender people and not be objectively wrong, so its useless.  -male=person with a penis problem: this is the one the lgbtq community refuses to accept.   The last definition is the ONLY one thats consistent and makes sense. Its grounded to physical evidence that is mostly consistent to everyone, with some outliers to keep in mind (Im not gonna get into the multiple sexes idea rn). Okay guys, prove me wrong!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Highly misleading and paradoxical. It is true that the origination of he/she predates the discovery of chromosomes, but is it not obvious that after the discovery, chromosomes became one of the defining features of the male and female? What differentiates a woman from a man is her potential to conceive a new life and bring it to the world.  The nonsensical argument that if any form has outer appearance like that of a woman should be considered a woman comes at the expense of reducing sexuality to mere perception. For instance, a plastic apple looks similar to a natural one in outer appearance and even gets called an apple, but is it really an apple? Does it have pulp, juice and seed? In spite of calling a fabricated apple an apple we internally don't believe it and to my understanding that is what these 'I feel like woman so should be called one(fuck biology)' activists are demanding. They simply don't want to be called with a particular pronoun, but also want to be believed to be a woman which they are not because they lack multiple defining biological features of a woman.  No one refuses to call a trans-person with their desired pronoun in a private space (not even Shapiro and Peterson), but same demand in public space acquires different connotations. The defining features of the categories of man and woman depend on the traits found in majority and that can not be blended with exceptions, as any act to do so would amount to the mockery of the very practice of characterization. There is a difference between perception and reality. Our perceptions can easily be corrupted as we perceive through our senses and what we see or sense is not always true and the false perception doesn't change the reality. So a claim to form a sense of reality only on the basis of perception is a joke.  I speak as an ignorant man questioning my enlightened queen.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This one was tough not gonna lie. It's hard to listen to people who would consider them selves 'feminists' would engage in such blatant body shaming. Even if I take it at face value that they just want to deconstruct gender, they still want men to be ashamed of there knuckle hair and forehead shape and the like. I did a feminist art piece for for my senior final project about sexism in advertising, and in trying to tell a story how sexism is everyone's problem I came across the term 'the male grotesque'. Using masculine features like body hair or a heavy gut or a bald head in order to repulse people and make short hand for the person you don't want to be in the ad. Similar to media creating unrealistic beauty standards for woman, a lot of media tells men that there bodies are inherently disgusting. This is just compounded when dealing with gender dysphoria. It's the kind of thing that made me hate feminism in high school, and I can see it applying to the anti-feminists today. Not only are they pushing hate speech against trans people, this kind of rhetoric creates new radically misogynist incels.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Just witness. Hear it, see it, feel it, mill it over, and once it soaks in you just treat everyone like humans.

Why if we break gender roles that someone would want to reestablish them with male and female identities.

"If I'm understanding you correctly, Natalie, or others :   Trans-friendliness requires giving external social reinforcement to a trans persons internal reality of gender. If that's correct then the biggest most important reinforcement for trans-women will come from women, especially cis-women or women treated from birth as women. 'Cos like what would a man know about being a woman?    Similarly the most reinforcement for a trans man would come from men.    So as a cis-man it is far more important for me to support a trans-man than Contrapoints. If Natalie is sexually turned on by men (heterosexual~? or erotically 'heterogendered'? then I might have some additional capacity to reinforce by recognition of attractiveness - but one can make no assumptions).      Is that correct? Most of what you Natalie, want from men is not to be assholes. What you need from women is inclusion.   Do trans people get both internalized misogyny and toxic masculinity at transition only, or all the time? Sorry, are you getting both now, did you only get one before.   If there were a category 'beautiful man' If I described a pre-transitioning or  gender complex trans person that way would that help, like we already have strong women.  strong vs beautiful : isn't that the crux of the gender binary?   so  many questions. It  may not be as complex and sophisticated as yours, but at least  my mind is confused. Must take some brillo to be as clear as you are.   thanks","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As I understand it, gender critical feminists believe that gender is something with which we're enculturated from birth. I'm hoping you'll touch on this, because it illustrates an important ideological difference that's often overlooked. It would seem to follow from this rationale reason that people like Meghan Murphy believe that you and Theryn Meyer can never be women because you were enculturated with a masculine gender identity from birth. You were raised as boys, and as such, cannot help but perceive the world through a masculine lens. Any common ground they appear to have with conservatives is dwarfed by what is ultimately a social constructionist interpretation of gender identity.    Granted, I'm not sure that this is anything more than motivated reasoning, and I suspect that if you probed their worldview and found an intersex condition they couldn't account for with this justification--the testes-at-twelve kids, for example, who I'm sure they're happy to foist a masculine identity even as they continue to regard trans-men as lost lesbian sisters--they'd be happy to paper over it with appeals to compassion, followed by scathing admonishment and swift retreat. I'd expect to hear something like, 'Intersex people have been horribly mutilated and stigmatized since the inception of modern medicine, and now you want to use them as ammunition in your cheap political disputes?

"Historically speaking, we've seen completely differing and sometimes contradictory expression, and cultural definitions of gender. Gender is mostly a social construct, but that doesn't make it any less extremely important to our identities. Because it is a socially and psychology constructed, it changes and doesn't always fit one type of body. Science is on that size, you really can't argue it without denying about a quarter million years of human(ish, including a few evolutionary ancestors) of observation and, a bit more recent, culture. Also, trans men know what it's like to have a stigmatized period and it can be even harder for them mentally due to the way society stigmatizes it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

In the end, I'm just bit utopian. I think you can be a she, and we can understand that there are statistical differences between genders, without reinforcing male/female brain stereotypes.

When some big anti-sjw I would watch would call a trans woman some slur or the other, it didn't feel right.

I think at the heart of the issue here is the fact that each side to this debate feels personally attacked by the other; each feels that the other's criticism is based on prejudice rather than concern.

However, I feel that you made a big generalization in implying that all gender critical people are aggressive and hateful towards trans people.

"aww I'm nonbinary can i join the table?  lol.  Great video... that greer quote made my skin crawl.   I agree that gender is a social construct... but, in my opinion (i'll play nice) that doesn't mean that people don't have gendered experiences that stem from something outside one's gender assignment... or rather, that stem from inside.  I find it contradictory that a person could say 'gender is a social construct'  and with the same breath say that someone can never be anything than the gender assigned to their sex.  If gender is a construct, it's a set of symbols that communicate meaning.  If gender, then, is a set of symbols that express a person's lived reality, why is it so hard to understand a body using the language of gender to express a lived reality that is different than the one forced upon it by 'the patriarchy'?   Just sayin', y'all.  ContraPoints did a great job of articulating just that around 10:00 in. Now can all us 'feminazis' (lol) play nice together for a sec and use our energy and big sexy brains to target institutions that are actively opposed to gender equality instead of tearing down transpeople?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Sure- pick the nastiest TERFs you can find while ignoring the incredibly rapey, entitled, vicious language of the nastiest trans-activists. You present things like talk about reproductive systems as an ongoing debate - as if the most virulent trans folk are reasonably trying to find a compromise there - when the fact of the matter is the worst of them ARE trying to shut down talk about the very very sexed nature of reproductive oppression by declaring that all of that language is wrong. You ignore the fact that the worst trans activists don't want us to talk about socialization because it makes them insecure. And you entirely ignore the fact that unlike most trans activists or liberal feminists, radfems actually have a cogent, supported, philosophically sound understanding of why patriarchy happens: reproductive vulnerability.   Shitty, asshat TERFs and shitty, asshat trans activists are the people that make exploration of a lot of actual common ground here, like the acknowledgment of gendered socialization AND the acknowledgment that someone can totally socially transition, possible. While I appreciate and actually agree with basically everything you've said here, this wasn't an argument in good faith.

"I really appreciate this video. I dabbled in the terf community on tumblr for a while in 2015-16 because I was questioning my gender and sexuality and did not feel at home in the general LGBT community. I saw almost no 'cis' GNC women, just all trans men and non-binary people, and didn't identify with that at all (despite experiencing dysphoria at the time and still do to some extent). I felt like if I wasn't a cis woman who embraced femininity, then I wasn't a cis woman at all and/or had no place in the community despite being bi. So to see a bunch of lesbian and bi women who weren't feminine and some of whom had also even experienced dysphoria like me was amazing. I did have some issues with the way being trans and gender as a whole was being presented and talked about, but it wasn't really an issue with trans people, it was an issue with myself. I didn't realize this until later, though. I had previously thought I was trans and would fantasize about medically transitioning to a man a lot (my identity crisis lasted several years), so I didn't connect with the transphobic part of the community. I somehow surrounded myself at first with 'gender critical' women who weren't outwardly nasty to trans women, so when I did encounter them I always was disgusted by SO many of them being nasty and outright dehumanizing toward trans people.... and soon realized it wasn't just a few bad apples but the majority of the movement. I still felt like it was the only place where my specific identity could belong so I put up with the abhorrent things they would say for a lot longer than I should've.  And once I finally did leave I still felt like I did not belong in the general LGBT community and now did not belong with others 'like me' either. Nowadays I've become a lot more comfortable with myself and my gender identity. I still feel out of place amidst my cis women and trans friends, but I guess that's just something I'm going to have to make peace with   There were a couple of genuine concerns that I had about gender but as I've gotten older I realized almost none of them held actual practical merit and I was just being a tight ass who didn't know how to deal with her own problems. My main one was the entire Abolish Gender point, but seeing as I was 16 I didn't quite realize was a pipedream that was. Another was some people calling lesbians 'vagina fetishist'  or sex vs gender and how to categorize attraction based on which. I was hoping you would touch on that, but I understand why you didn't. Again, thank you for this video. I still have ingrained 'terfy' feelings sometimes I got from just being embroiled in that community and it's stuff like this that really helps to sweep them away for good.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I understand and agree with the point that we should be critical towards conforming gender identities, but on the other hand, I find e.g. the traditional aesthetics of masculinity and femininity also to be a great source of joy, and see transgenderism as an opening and exploration towards the enjoyment of these identities in a freer, less restricted way.

It is not fully explained but core disgust,  animal nature disgust and finally moral disgust are 3 categories of the study of disgust.   What disgust at transgender people seem to trigger are the body envelope part of the animal nature category and moral category of disgust. The anterior insular is most probably part of the process.

"Ultimately, I think that saying 'trans women are women' erases both of our unique set of experiences. You are valid, not matter what, so am I. There is nothing wrong with acknowledging that trans women are trans women, who still have biologically male bodies (medically, having different needs than natal women).   There may be disgust about trans women in that small subgroup of rads you derisively speak of as TERFS (that group doesn't have a lot of power you know), but you're not mentioning the violence that trans women like to joke about enacting on TERFS (e.g, the bloody 'I punch TERFS' shirt') Joking about violence against women seems a lot like what MRA folks like to do. I don't want trans women to be treated as a point of mockery, but I don't agree that trans women are women (because they're still biologically male); Women who have trauma from rape shouldn't be expected to welcome people with penises into their spaces (gyms, baths, etc...), because they may have panic attacks and an intense fear of dick, we can't ignore their real suffering.  My problems have been defined because I was born a natal woman. But I'm not saying your problems aren't real, they're just different. What's so wrong with trans women being trans women? Because it feels like male-bodied people are coming in and saying that they know what womanhood is and should define it.     Not passing is not terrible or disgusting, and you don't have to pass to be a woman socially. If you want to be called a woman and live as one (whatever that means), then by all means do so. I'm not deriding that. Even if I could tell you were a biological man dressing as a woman, I wouldn't misgender you, and would ask your pronoun preference. I don't think every trans woman has the ability to pass (so it's already a privilege to do so), and it shouldn't be the gold standard or define them as successful if they do or don't.  You want to be open minded though, while suing a word that may incite violence against women, whom you claim to stand by. >.>","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Contrapoints I really want to thank you for what you do. I'm a cis woman diagnosed with end stage adenomyosis and endometriosis at 21 years old and am debating getting a hysterectomy or keeping it to try to have children, but not without overwhelming outside commentary about what I should do and what it means to sacrifice or preserve my potential 'divine role' . I really love being able to see into another type woman with an 'unconventional' I  guess you could say life, just living and talking about it. Even though our femininity is so extremely different in how we got to it, I somehow feel like I can relate to you and other trans women who do have to spend energy and money to maintain their womanhood-welfare much much more than the other women in my life who insist I'm just born defective and therefore deserve no support.  The whole idea of basing womanhood around sex exclusively is damaging not only to trans women, but to cis women like myself, born not with a penis just a totally useless cancer-inducing womb that will kill me if I don't have it removed.   I feel so understood and connected when I watch your content, in a way I can't find when I'm trying to connect with other cisgender women, especially who don't have my diseases.

"Always believed gender has little to do with biology and more about social interactions. Always also believed that behavioral changes between genders is mostly caused by the way they grew up etc. So I'm all in about 'abolishing gender' (as much of an utopia as it sounds). The question is, if they do believe all the above how can they be against transsexual people? In my opinion, transsexuals prove exactly the 'oh so frightening' branch of feminism known as 'gender is just a social construct' for they are able to be re-birthed by changing their behavior and their body into matching their identity.  Simply put: Transsexuals prove the whole point of that specific feminist theory by 'changing socially' in order to show who they truly are. So if anything, if they wanted to truly abolish gender they would make transsexuals their best examples in their account, but I guess that wouldn't allow them to complain all day without doing anything for an actual social change now would it?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Initially I was extremely sympathetic to trans people as I would be for any oppressed group. However, over time I have become more and more opposed to any of it. I personally don't give a crap if you live your life as a woman, but your characterization of why biological women would object, seems perfectly reasonable on the surface, but is skewed by your (understandable) desire to be vindicated.  Trans people lose their shit when Rachel Dolezal is mentioned, because it is an exact spot-on analogous situation. Except that when black folk said 'Uh, fuck no', everybody pretty much said OK because telling black folk to shut up about blackness is pretty much seen (correctly) as Not Freakin Cool. The more I hear 'terf' and see the calling for violence against biological women, calling us 'fish' and all sorts of other bullshit, the more I think, you are NO ally of *mine*. So how can you think that we should be allies to you? That is just silly, or worse, the typical expectation that OF COURSE women will make way and cede position, like they have been forced to do for eons. Which is a very male way of thinking.   I can't and wouldn't declare myself a Navajo, swan on in and start telling Navajo people what a 'real' Navajo really is, redefined to include myself.  It's both ridiculous and wrong. And yet, here we are. A video deconstructing why women might object to sharing social and *political* space with a 'person with a penis', as you might say, with a suitably clownish caricature speaking as the sock puppet with easily discountable straw man arguments.  How about a video outlining how trans people could be allies to *women*. For people who proclaim the desire to *be* a woman, many of you seem to *hate* women. For myself, that engenders a white hot rage. Clearly this needs to be pointed out, but it's not women killing trans people, it is men. I have yet to see a headline telling of the brutal death by beating of a trans person *by women*.  You think the dude in the bar cares what the feminist intelligentsia thinks when he discovers that the chick he was macking on has a penis?!   There is WAY more to this story than straw man arguments.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'I'm literally just throwing glitter spaghetti at the wall, hoping a glimmer of feminity will shine through.' This really got me. I'm a CIS woman and I relate to this a lot. I'm not making an equivalency claim, because the stakes and variables are obviously different, but I think that a lot of CIS women go through similar things to try to present as 'feminine enough' for society to see them as feminine, so there should be more understanding of the reasons and struggles of transwomen.  This is a small example, but I can remember getting many bad haircuts as a kid that made people refer to me as a boy, everywhere I went, and I remember that being a really crushing feeling, not being recognized for who I was. As a teenager, I went through a similar thing when I started wearing makeup and skinny jeans because I felt like I didn't look as feminine as I felt without those things. Now that I'm in my 20's, I tend to go for a more androgynous look most of the time, with simple clothing and little to no makeup, because that's how I feel comfortable at this point in my life, but for anyone who has to work at presenting the image that matches how they think of themselves, it would be a pretty crappy consolation prize to criticize them for putting in that work, or expecting them to just not care how people see and interact with them based on how they look.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Notes on point 3- I've heard time and time again that gender identity is not the same as gender expression yet when you mock abolishing gender you get rid of your gender expression (make up, dresses, etc). The idea is not to get rid of these materialistic things but instead to abolish the connection it has to one sex or the other. Keep wearing your make up and dresses but abolishing gender means to accept yourself as male (sex) whilst doing these things. Gender is a social construct and these material aspects are not part of femaleness. Female is a classification of people that have a common attribute and that's their biological sex (same goes for males). Clothing is not an attribute as not every woman dresses the same or every man dresses the same. Behaviour isn't an attribute because not all women act the same or all men act the same. These groups are connected solely by biology. Abolishing gender means to acknowledge biology and let people dress and act however why they want.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I first heard the term 'gender critical' about a year ago from the girlfriend of one of my friends, and she identified as such. As a non-binary trans, the term really bothered me but I couldn't explain why as I'd never heard of it and I had no idea what it fully encompassed, though I guessed (correctly, as it turned out) it meant TERF dressed up in 'nicer' language. At the time I asked 'have you ever met someone gender critical who wasn't a TERF?' and she replied 'oh yeah, loads, they're really nice'. Yeah, well, plenty of people, including racists, misogynists, homophobes etc can be 'nice', especially to their own kind. 'Nice' isn't all it's cracked up to be.  And now a year later I finally have a good rebuttal video to send to her, full of great counter points and easy-to-understand analogies.

But both most certainly have some reason for their crazed hatred. Which you addressed breifly as being the case but then quickly brushed over that fact. Tho I suppose that is understandable since this group is directly attacking you specifically. But the defense you gave is also not as nuanced as your other videos of the trans experience. So it'd probably be better for the people on the fence to go watch those, because I don't think this would be convincing. I especially didn't like the mocking voice used for the Sylvia Plath quote since she said nothing offensive and I dunno why her point can't be taken seriously.

"I think a lot of the outrage against Germaine Greer is overblown, and this is as someone who bought into it initially. SHe's deep into thoroughly biological female issues and in that context maybe it makes perfect sense to hold to the distinction between trans women and biological women. I think trans issues really just aren't her area and she keeps getting thrust into it over what she's said and written in the past.   It might just be maturity or absolute disgust with the state of the Internet or general-purpose existensial horror but the outrage simply isn't fun for me anymore having seen what it can lead to.  She might indeed be a TERF but she ain't the worst TERF, just a big ol' dick sometimes.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"A TERF was invited to speak before a House committee a few days ago. There was a Congressional hearing about the Equality Act. Mainstream media, and even so called independent progressive news sources are basically completely ignoring it. No one is talking about the fact that the Equality Act that would add sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity to the groups federally protected from discrimination. Right wing shit stains are framing this as an assault on cis women, and no one else is talking about it at all. I am a cis lesbian, and I'm far more concerned about the fact that I can be fired, evicted, or denied emergency medical care in thirty US states than the fact that trans women might complicate conversations on gender stereotypes.    This act is likely to pass in the House but very unlikely to pass in the Senate. I feel that you should mention in a video, and on your social media accounts, that people should be contacting their senators early and often to demand that they vote yes on the Equality Act when it reaches the Senate. It is still completely legal for queer and trans people to be denied housing, denied employment, fired, evicted, and denied medical care for being gay or trans in THIRTY states in this country. The Equality Act would finally give us legal recourse against this kind of discrimination. It is actually getting worse for gay and trans people in many of the thirty states that don't have anti-discrimination laws to protect the LGBTQ community. For example, a bill was just introduced in Texas that would make it easier than ever for lawyers and doctors to refuse service to gay and trans people.   Long before that most recent bill, Texas has been very clear about it's contempt for the LGBTQ community. In Texas, it's not only legal for teachers to be fired for being gay, as you can be fired from any job in Texas for being gay, but even straight teachers can be fired for being supportive of their gay or trans students. A TEACHER CAN BE FIRED FOR TELLING A CHILD THAT THEY ARE A GOOD PERSON AND THEY SHOULD LOVE THEMSELF. This is the sort of hatred and discrimination we are facing in the majority of US states.  Please use your platform to urge people to contact their senators and demand that they vote yes on the Equality Act, especially if they live in a red state.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I m writing to you now, because I would like to thank you in particular for what you said in this video about supporting the struggle cis women specifically face against the patriarchy (and about that, I would like to add that I think reproductive rights affect not only the social experience of individual women, but also capitalism's way to reinforce its structure and to reproduce its race, gender, and class hierarchies, and to me that's kind of the point).

"I adore you, this video was amazing. I really appreciate the explanation of the TERF point of view and eloquent rebuttal. The idea that women's 'femaleness' is rooted in our oppression ignores the fact that women around the world experience oppression in varying ways and intensities. To assert that a trans woman is not a real woman because she hasn't experienced the painful formative misogyny of a cis woman is as naive a claim as insisting a first world cis woman is not a real woman because she hasn't experienced the intense misogyny that women from more misogynist cultures have.  At the end of the day we can't define our womanness by how men mistreat us because not only are those experiences so radically different from person to person and community to community, but also, we're once again giving men the power to define us. The only person who can define our womanhood is ourselves. Like Catherine MacKinnon said, 'anyone who identifies as a woman... As far as I'm concerned, is a woman'.

"Where was this video three years ago? I used to obsess over this questions (specially the ones about what constitutes a 'male' or 'female' brain, or if the gender binary was even a real thing I should support). For a couple of months I couldn't think about anything else. I wanted desperately to know what was the difference between female and male identity, what made a person decide to transition, what made a person decide to identify as something most people have never heard of. This was on 2016, the highest point of the SJW bandwagon (or whatever you want to call it), so it kinda makes sense this was going through my mind. It didn't help that I never fitted in the average girl image, I had spent my teenage years as a bisexual girl and I wanted to look more masculine if anything, and was starting to wonder if that desire could actually correspond to a non binary identity. Then I discovered anti SJW Youtube and found a place where they gave clear answers to those questions that I could agree on (mostly because the people giving them were a fun girl or guy with a sense of humor I could relate to, instead of an angry stereotypical non binary person that probably hated me for even dating to question the foundation of their identity). Now I look back on some of your videos and I can see that many times they were mean to or even bullying weaker people (like Milo in his first videos). I still follow some of them because I enjoy their new content, but most I have unsuscribed.  Good thing I just gave up caring and try to find 'the truth', because there is no truth.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

For some reason I found myself crying lol as she went on about MGTOW and how feminism is death for society. In short I feel quite thrown and I'd like to know more of your thoughts. There were comments on the videos like ' Stop using tax payer money for abortions ' ' shame women who choose to be single mums ' ' increase the birth rate like how Russia did ' and they all just sound like nazi ideals like the kinder kuche and kirsche and I don't really get it ahhhh.

"My concerns come from working in a section of healthcare that occasionally has to be aware of sex-specific considerations. The most famous example of a sex-specific concern is arterial plaque buildup (concentrated in cis men, diffuse in cis women). I can't find any quality research on whether trans patients are more likely to have patterns consistent with their chromosomal sex or if a full medical transition causes the pattern to be more consistent with the patient's chosen sex (sorry if I bungled any terms).

"Hey, Contrapoints! I have a few questions and I feel like you'd be the best person to answer them. (Even though you will most likely not see this question and someone in the replies will answer it for me.)  First, a little background information on myself to give a better view of my stance. I am a cis man, I do not personally know any out trans people living in southern Georgia, and I am gay but I don't really think that matters too much for my question. Anyway enough of the foreplay, onto the question.  A few weeks back, I'd say early March maybe, I was in the library of my high school taking my online class (not actually) and some reason or another, my friend and I got on the topic of gender politics. I'm an open-minded person and gave them the usual rhetoric concerning gender. 'It is a social construct blah blah' Then this dude, who I have never spoken to before rolls up to us and introduces himself and says, 'Hello! Sorry, I couldn't help but overhear your conversation and had to say something.' Being where I live, expected the same southern ignorant speak of 'only two genders!' which is not even my argument, but he shocked me. I assume this guy is conservative and probably had good intentions as he proposed a pretty good argument to me. Anyway, back to the story; we begin talking about our stances and debating on gender politics and trans problems. I don't know why he ended up saying this, but it stuck with me for a while now... he said;  'What do you think the suicide rate is for trans people before and after their transition?' 'I don't know, I would assume less.' 'No, it is near the exact same.' (I think to myself that it is a BS lie, but let him continue.) He then goes onto say, 'What the studies show is that no matter what Trans person does, they can never reach their goal gender to their level of standard.' At this point, I'm pretty pessimistic about what the guy is going to say next. 'Take for example other mental disorders (We both agreed that Gender Dysphoria is a mental disorder) like anorexia. You do not help an anorexic person reach their goal weight, if you do that they will die. Instead of trying transition transgender people, why not mediate the problem through medicine and therapy like we would with any other disorder?'  I'm not going to lie to you, that argument sounded pretty damn good to me. We continued a little bit after that, but I forget the rest. That however stuck with me. Being the person I am,  I wanted to ask more questions about it. I figured asking another cis man would get me nowhere, so I wanted to ask a Trans person. I don't know anybody Trans as I stated earlier so I took to the internet which was a pretty bad idea. I went to a couple of discord channels and got nowhere... I went to a forum and get zero replies. And now, here I am, asking the comment section of one of my favorite YouTubers. Anyway, that was a lot of build so I am going to go ahead and ask the questions.  1. As a trans person, do you feel you will ever reach a point in time in which you are completely satisfied with your gender and how the world views you or is it a fruitless endeavor?  2. Is Gender Dysphoria on the same tier as Anorexia or OCD to you? Or is it an entirely separate thing?  3. As a trans person, how would you feel about medication that could mediate the problem or completely eliminate Gender Dysphoria?  BONUS: Who is your favorite drag queen and how do you feel about the 11th season of RuPaul's Drag Race? (Of course, this is assuming that all LGBTQ+ people watch Drag Race, and not just gay men.) (I also wanted to ask this question just because I recently found the show and have been enjoying the hell out of it and had no one to speak to about it.)  Anyway thank you to anyone who read that mess, and if ContraPoints somehow sees this; I want to thank you as I steal 100% of my views from your videos like the sheeple I am.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think addressing transphobia is great. And it needs to be said that hate is hate no matter what you call it. I get it. But I didn't feel there was a great deal of depth to the analysis of queer theory. Certainly I think Natalie has analysed an arrival point of queer theory --or where it's at now...but there is very little analysis of the two base camps--the essentialists (birth defines roles) and the constructivists (linguistically defined social bodies). Also a lack of analysis of actual 'feminism'. Quoting Greer (an easy scapegoat--I mean who likes her anyway) and yea gods (Catherine McKinnon conservative anti-porn legislator) does not a feminist analysis make. For people watching this the first time--won't know who yr talking about or that yr talking about second wave feminism at all or the victories they won and the damage they've caused my trans brothers and sisters. I feel you've only just scraped the surface in comparison to earlier videos that were much more in depth and better researched when less personal. Also find the suicide reference a little trite and glib and a vague attempt at humour fell flat for me. Other than that I love the Apollonian/Dionysian Natalie's which may have been a stab at Camille Paglias Female suprematist BS but I've been wrong before...I like the dialogue and is vastly entertaining. Still as a famous fashion oligarch once said 'less is more' too much information overwhelms rather than satisfies--and this may take a while for Natalie to master the soft touch...(sigh) And to cover less topics (fine tooth) more thoroughly esp. when dealing with Feminism and Queer Politics in just 30 mins unless. A) u be trans and b) u be so qaf that u carry a fkn card and a PhD to boot. Sooooo that being said TERFs still needed to be tskd tskd and that kind of made my day!

"As a trans man... totally not a fan of being called a 'menstruator.'  But then, I'm also not a fan of menstruating at all, so there's that.   I've had a--let's say 'interesting' relationship with the concept of gender growing up. I was raised in an incredibly conservative, anti-feminist religious denomination (which was *totally* not a cult, except it kinda was) in the Bible Belt, and even though there were definitely a lot of signs I wasn't a girl, I actually managed to repress the whole 'I'm a guy' thing until fall 2018.  I didn't even know trans men or nonbinary people existed until I was around 20, and the very little I knew about trans women was so bigoted and inaccurate.   I stumbled into a rather liberal pocket of the internet when I was 20 or so, by total accident, and made friends with some (lovely) people before I actually realized they were The Dreaded Liberalz.  So then I had a crisis, because these people were very nice, and their beliefs honestly made more sense to me than my parents' views, and cue the crisis of beliefs. For maybe half a year of my transitional period from sheltered 'anti-SJW' to flaming liberal, I guess I held TERFy viewpoints, but those were shut down pretty quickly when my best friend-slash-future partner hinted about maybe being transfeminine.   Around 22, I started questioning my gender because female didn't fit right. I wondered if I was nonbinary but that didn't completely fit either, but I didn't actually accept that I was a guy until several months ago, after moving out of my parents' house after getting married (to the aforementioned partner who is so good about my gender situation).  So that's been fun.   I said all that to say that, because of millions of layers of repression, I definitely do identify a lot with the 'female experience' and oppressions, even if I'm still not a girl (please, TERFs, stop calling me one). At the same time, I also seem to have subconsciously picked up on a lot of the same traits that my dad instilled in my cis brother, so... Idk, still working that one out. Essentially, in my experience, I find my upbringing was quite *similar* to the 'female experience' but there was also some dissonance in some places. (Edited to add: of course, I recognize that if I come out and transitioned and society saw me as a man, my experience would become a lot different, naturally.  Hell... I'd settle for not being called 'ma'am' every time I check out at the grocery store. Seriously. Every. Time.)   Anyway! I first found your channel through your video on the term 'trap' (because one of my friends and I were currently having a debate on the subject) and I've quite enjoyed all your videos that I've seen so far.  The amount of thought that you put into your content is impressive, and I always feel like I end up learning something or thinking about something in a new way, even if it's a subject I've put thought into for a while myself.  It's really rad.  (Not in the 'radfem' way, but in the 'slang from back when my parents were younger than I am now' way.)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Once I had a guy teacher whose dream was to wear big crystal rings. And I just couldnt understand why wouldnt he simply ... Wear them. I think society has a way of loading specific meanings into objects... An habit that can be very harmful. These ideas are really very nuanced, as you said.

I think 'being a woman' has a whole universe of meanings behind it but It always  comes down to: do you feel like one?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Hey @contrapoints what is the definition of 'woman' or 'womanhood' you're using? I'll admit that I'm clueless on the topic of transgenderism and trying to be open minded about it but I don't know what it means to be a 'woman' from a transgender point of view. Is it just the social identity I.e everyone refers to you as a woman and uses female pronouns or is it something more, less or completely different from that?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Sometimes it just seeps into your head like spilled bong water on a carpet and it's so hard to scrub out the stains it leaves and even then the scent lingers.  That's what it's like to have all eyes on you, people staring and whispering things, the obligatory 'what is it?'.

You know?, 'Well I don't get what the fuck is going on, but whatever, let people do whatever makes them happy', that kind of thing.  - but videos like this that break down and explain the subject are incredibly helpful and allow otherwise well meaning but ultimately ignorant people to listen to actual trans voices and form something of an understanding of the subjects discussed.   Also the teapot bit almost killed me, never stop doing what you do.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Wonderful explanation! Thank you!! I am wondering if things can be made easier by having both gender and sex on document? So that gender is completely self-identified (faster recognition for trans), while sex is medically assessed (for medical inclusion). So that women's book club welcomes cis and trans women alike, while female sports competition (where hormone level makes a difference) only permits female.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"So, as an actually gender critical straight cis white male, this video is incredibly enlightening. The part about talking about abolishing gender being used as a bludgeon against trans-individuals instead of against actual perpetrators of our patriarchal culture (both toxic masculinity and commodified femininity), really hit home.    My criticisms of transgenderism falls squarely on wondering if sex change surgery is really an appropriate measure, as to my mind it equates to self-mutilation, and there are studies that showcase the unhappiness of post-op individuals. To me it feels like an extreme solution. But, even as a male who is much more emotional than my female partner who has always felt more at home with the women in my family than the men, it isn't my struggle and I can't know what it is like to feel alien in my gender expression.    I know what it is like to struggle with depression, and perhaps its easy for me to see parallels with a sex change to suicide that aren't there (that is an imperfect and permanent solution to a problem it likely doesn't fix) that may not be there.

"I'd also like to add that one of the best responses to terfs saying that having babies or uterus is the only way one can be a woman is just like, that's so unfeminist to say. A woman's right to be a woman doesn't sit on her ability to have children that's what conservative politicians say to tell woman who don't want kids that they're wrong. What about the cis women who have amenorrhea and don't have periods? I am not a cis woman I do have a uterus but I also have PCOS and I've read so many blog posts and comments on pcos forums about cis women struggling to connect fully to womanhood b/c of the infertility and pain and hatred of their uterus that PCOS causes and that's even without the fact that 70% of of people with PCOS produce more testosterone than the average afab body which causes even more issues with feeling disconnected to womanhood and being made fun of for looking too mannish or for looking looking the way a woman should. Like if TERFs really cared so much about protecting women they would care that so much of their language and definitions of what it means to be a woman or posts about how to 'clock' a trans woman hurts cis women too. But they don't care about that because it is just primarily a hate movement. And that's one of the biggest ways to know that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I basically just failed to identify as female for most of my early life (Aspie late bloomer), and I feel like I experienced male privilege to a surprising extent, just because I didn't respond to anyone as if I were a woman. I wasn't harassed as a kid. I wasn't much flirted with, because it was pretty obvious my interest wasn't there (again, late bloomer). And periods were my best time of the month. Feminists used to yell at me that I was just afraid of the term, but I basically had to learn about what other women faced, in my mid-twenties, and I was being told that it was men's and trans women's place to shut up and watch while the real women spoke, and based on everything they said, I wasn't one. There was a gap of six *years* between when I started performing femininity and when I finally came out (to the tiny circle of friends who knew how knotted up I'd been about it) as a woman. But I think I caught everyone off guard with how much I transitioned, after that -- once I gave up on feeling loudly excluded from a gender that I kept being loudly told was both my responsibility and my birthright. I still identify very strongly with the position trans women are in. I was born with a vagina, but we're still basically in the same boat.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hi Natalie.  Love it love it love it.  Can't thank you enough for the education.  I have a question - although ignore if you have already covered it and I missed it.  Now, I'm not denying body dysmorphia at all, but I wonder about the narrative that tends to bracket all trans people as body dysmorphic.  I guess that's a historical issue, in respect of the medical profession, under the auspices of an 'ignorant' society at large, misunderstanding, coming to terms with the increased visibility of trans people, and especially younger people identifying as trans.  The question is, are we moving on from the medicalisation now?  How do the trans community feel about this issue (although I do think this is a vital question for society at large too)?  I'm pretty sure many young people questioning their gender identity are still getting shoved straight into the doctor's surgery and coming out with a diagnosis; where support, love, validation, education, knowledge and encouragement would have been the better option.  I mean, I guess some trans people are relieved at the bd diagnosis because it sets them on their chosen path of transition, whether that be straightforward recognition, or treatment and such.  That's it.  Forgive any of my own ignorance or improper language, if I have strayed into difficult waters.  I just instinctively feel, we should be opposing such medicalisation in the same way we would oppose the incarceration of women for 'hysteria' (which I frightfully fear may still be happening some places).

No matter how much, no matter when you decide to treat it or how you decide to treat it, or if you spent decades repressing it before you realized you couldn't anymore.

Most of us don't hate our bodies, we just wish they were aligned with how we see ourselves and how we want to be seen.

"cw for transphobia including internalised, dysphoria, depression and suicide ideation etc i suppose...  I knew... well I told my parents around... what? Age 3? 4? Maybe 5. I was shut down. I internalised it for years. Got heavy depression. I was already suicidal at age 10. I was in pain all the time and wanted to jump from the wall at the back of the school ground, onto the floor below, something like 20 feet down.  It came back to hit me around 11 years old, with puberty and swimming in PE. I came out to some friends shortly after. I was shamed for it. My cousin shamed me for it. When I came out to my parents at age 13 they talked to me for literal hours telling me things like I would never be a 'real woman', that it was a phase, and asking me if what I felt (which I realised years later is heavy dysphoria) wasn't because I was abused by someone as a kid.  So yeah. If that's male socialisation, I don't know what to tell you.  It was a fucking war. I was given orders and expected to behave a certain way and it went against my very core and now when I look back it feels like it's still a raw wound that won't heal. Maybe that's why I just couldn't stand studying the book Regeneration in English Litt in High School.   As for the matter of dysphoria validating being trans? Hell, I feel less trans because of it. I can't even fucking accept myself. I see all efforts I make as not enough and just see... what's underneath all my clothes and makeup and shit... and I just don't feel valid. I feel like a ridiculous, grotesque freak show. And I look at other trans women like you and I admire you all so much.

"28:01 Since you're making this your definitive proof, I'd like to rebut that. What 'paradoxical' critique you're ascribing to feminists is in fact perfectly consistent with the critique towards both a man self gendered as woman, which in itself by definition and your own admission @11:36 is a misogynistic stereotype, that merely wears a facade of being a woman while at the same time acts with all the toxic masculinity of males. Loud, demanding, raging. You indeed don't see women indulge in death and rape threats ever. EVER. Which brings my next point.  And since you're delving into the nitty-gritty of the exclusion problem, I'll have to expose your dishonesty and that of the entire misogynistic liberal feminist movement calling feminists TERFs when they clearly don't exclude trans people at all but merely males. Trans females are more than welcome as they are not demanding and toxic. You can call them MERFs if you want but stop the TERF lies please.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This was really helpful and important to watch, because as a cis female I didn't even realize that I was unconsciously / internally using a lot of the same rhetoric that 'gender critical' feminists do. Thank you for taking the time to genuinely address these questions. There's one thing I'm still confused about, however: why does that lizard part of our brain feel such disgust for trans people? Why do trans people feel this disgust about themselves? The best reason I can come up with it because it bothers us to not be able to fit things into simple, clean cut boxes, but I'm not sure if that's the 'right' answer. In other words, does anybody know why the disgust that fuels transphobia (and gender dysphoria) exists in the first place?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"11:36 That's a huge strawman, no feminist is saying 'don't be transgender', we're saying leave women spaces alone, stop claiming to be female and stop the whole female penis charade that's destructive as fuck to the feminist discussion of their oppression and the utopia in question. The strawman is there for a reason, you're not really interested in a genderless society utopia very much. Which is normal since you and I as males have had amazing lives and so see no urgency in ending the women's oppression that is gender. If I as a feminist man do not feel the urge to end patriarchy enough to even regularly attend feminist protests, you as barely a feminist probably feel the urge much much less.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The problem here is really the extent to which the trans narrative has become a meta-narrative that is policed and enforced. Any dissenters (TERFS) are reported to the thought police (social media high-ups who have the power to ban), and are rejected from the platforms and the discourse itself, or else they are put on ban-lists so people never even have to encounter the ideas, or else they are rejected from their local queer communities because any word not fully supportive of transness is taken as meaning they are hateful and bigoted and do not deserve a place among the few people who share their sexuality.    While the abolition of gender may be a utopian ideal and the freedom to transition should be retained, the hostility the trans narrative forces upon gender-critical feminists borders on totalitarian control or religious brain-washing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Oh also I wished you had talked about how in the grander scheme of feminism across the political spectrum, TERFs tend to fall right of centre. Voting habits, especially outside of the US, skew towards conservative political parties. There's hardly anything radical about their feminism, they work more to maintain existing social structures even more than liberal feminists do.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"The VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE don't recognize the idea of gender separate from sex. Not just the 'TERFs' in your radfem hellworld.  Sex is a better predictor of behavior than any social construct/personal identification, the problem is that surface-level behaviors aren't the best indicators of what's actually going on. Think about why there are so many more trans women than trans men, and nonbinary females than nonbinary males. It speaks to something intrinsic.  And none of this is a scientific issue. We hardly have a reliable model/theory of mind, let alone identity. People who say that the concept of gender separate from sex is scientific are being completely ahistorical and not telling the truth about the history of feminism and gender theory.  MORALIZING what is a metaphysical/ontological issue will eventually backfire. The wave will roll back, especially as slogans such as 'trans women are women' are pushed, and the idea that straight men not willing to date trans women are bigots. Then maybe people with dysphoria can actually get effective help instead of having enablers cause them more harm by reifying their delusions.  Dismissing the real criticisms of contemporary gender theory as 'troll questions' shows only denial. I don't want you to not exist. I don't want you to be harassed. I don't even want you to stop believing the things you believe. I do want you to stop moralizing a philosophical point that most people don't understand for obvious, understandable reasons. If your identity rests on MY accepting an untenable ontological position then it has no base.  At the end of the day, dysphoria is not valid epistemology. How you feel doesn't say much at all about what you are. If you can't agree on that then we're not on the same plane of reality. As long as the 'trans women are women' line is being pushed then transsexualism is as much of an enemy to coherent thought as transubstantiation. It's just doublethink.  And yes, the gas station attendant is being polite because he's on facebook. We're all reading the same histrionic shit and it's much less of a hassle to just humor people. I'm not so boring as to spend my time hating and being disgusted by trans people. It's the extremely basic political dialogue around them that I hate.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I have a question about personal thought and if it can be gendered. I've studied a bit into gender & linguistics (actual name of the course), on here you speak on the performance, the persistent acting of one's social role, but what about thought? I don't feel like I've seen anyone ask about thought. But do you think like a woman, me like a man? What does it mean if we do? If there is gendered thought, is that something into which one may transition, is it an eternal carrot on a stick, ... is it just not a thing? Personally, I've always had an itch in the back thinking that I think like a girl. This is the first I've really given it glare with pursed brow, however. I always kinda brushed off as, well I might just be gay and waited for enough the tequila to twang my curiosity. It did. And now I know I'm not, which sucks because now I have resign myself to potentially missing out on some really unique and special experiences. Poor me, but I digress. Back to the topic at hand, discourse and performance and a pretty clear social value, but thought is pretty detached from that value, I think. However, the two former are used to build understanding, which takes place in thought .. and I don't know. So, I turn to you, smart human.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Your talk about every woman being able to 'clock a tran' reminded me of something that I did that I still chuckle a little about but also feel bad at the same time.  (Also I had never heard that phrase before. <.< . . Also yeah that's not rational at all. )  I had a transwoman come into a restaurant I was waitressing in.  It never occured to me that she was trans.  Had no idea.  Looking back I'm sure other people could have said she was but I just don't really think about those things. She hinted at it in her conversations with me as I served her pizza and refilled drinks.   I tend to be a little clueless to the point of totally missing social cues.  So when she went to pay she handed me a card to pay that had a man's photo on it and a male name.  I was confused but the man on the photo had the same nose and general face shape.  She asked me if I could see the resemblance and I said ' of course I can. '   She seemed pretty sad but said it was her brother and I was minimum wage so I went ahead and used the card.  She left and it was roughly two hours later that I realized that I had probably really hurt her feelings.  I laugh at my own cluelessness but feel awful that I may have hurt her feelings.  I'm afraid she may have thought that I saw her as ' a man ' and not how she wanted to be perceived.  In reality. . I was COMPLETELY clueless.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

So...good manners, common sense, minding yer own business, having few laws and simple ones. There's nowt so queer as folk and folk have always been queer. There is no novel reality that popped up in the last 20 years that ancient laws and customs do not have answers to. Rights of trans people ( of ALL people) are as they ever were. No law can outlaw hate just as no law can compel love. Recourse to the coercive power of the state sets everyone at each other's throats.

"Many people drawn to terf ideology have had some 'trans' type feelings or experiences which instead of putting down to gender dysphoria have put down to living in a misogynistic society. Many women have experienced gender dysphoria due to traumatic experiences or even just the way women's bodies are viewed in society. It can be unpalatable then when some trans activist try to frame gender as a question of merely 'identifying'... as though there is a kind of element of choice... some women find it very hard to identify with being a 'woman', it's forced on us in a way. I'm just worried that the current discourse around gender erases that aspect of womanhood and frames all cis women as happy and content with their gender, otherwise they must be trans, when that might not be the case.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm left really concerned with your argument against the abolishment of gender.  What I think of as 'abolishing gender' generally concerns refraining from using labels for forms of expression (e.g. to be caring is feminine; to be crass is masculine), and not to abolish expression itself. To group together a series of traits under the umbrella of a single gender is absurdly broad and unnecessary; the hyper-generalization of traits is the reason why many feel that they can't be well categorized into any of the genders that are commonly found in a single culture.  This model may seem utopian, but it's not very complicated to stop labelling items, actions, and appearances as 'manly,' etc., and it seems too dismissive to classify the abolishment of gender as some far-off and unachievable goal.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

That being said, while it isn't uncommon for people in the transmed community to attack others (something we need to work on as a community), I do think the arguement was a little miscategorized here (I apologize if I used that word incorrectly). I won't deny that there are more radical individuals than I am who do think that way, but the majority of the transmed community doesn't define dysphoria as hating your body. I'm a firm believer that any level of dysphoria is 'enough' dysphoria. I would never tell someone who experiences even the slightest dysphoria (which I am defining as discomfort or distress in being percieved as the individual's AGAB/feeling uncomfortable or distressed by things about yourself that remind you of your AGAB), physical or social, that they were invalid.  I apologize for the long paragraph, and I hope you're having a good day. :)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I cited violence, harassment, and 'none of your damn business', etc., but I think there is just more to it than that and I'm not aware. Do you think you could do a video on that?

"A thing that I saw happen, having friends on both sides of the shitstorm, was a pagan event that had a single 'biofem only women's mysteries' class.  It was all 'moonblood, and womb worship'  The Actual concern (apart from a potential TERF connection by the woman leading it) was one nobody would bring up publicly, was there were a couple trans women in the community that any time 'Women's Issues' came up, they would derail the discussion and make it all about Them and their transness, when it was Supposed to be about 'moonblood and womb worship' and nobody wanted to deal with that.    The resultant fight caused a schizm in the community, who Should all be on the same side.     It got Really nasty and hurtful all around.  And apart from the outright bigotry, I could see from my very outside perspective where everybody was coming from, and it was like watching people bash their defensive wounds together.  And I, of course, couldn't chime in with what I was observing, where the emotion and immediacy of the fight was way to personal for everybody actually involved to...  There was no communication, there was just fight.    After watching that go down, I've been pondering this question, of how do you discuss some of the hard things surrounding the Difference, which there functionally is, between Born Women, and Trans Women, and where those differences Matter and where they Don't, in a way that keeps everybody safe?  I just don't know.  But I think that's a thing that needs to be explored-  but any nuance seems to be a crack that assholes come howling through with their disingenuous and bad faith arguments.  That seems to be a Thing with everything now.    This doesn't really exist with trans men and bio men- provided nobody's an asshole bigot-  that's an unfair thing, and partially a thing of male privilege (we are not defined or punished for our biology) and partially, well we're just not... share your beer, don't be an asshole, and we're cool, pretty much.  Our identities and worldviews around biology don't inherently conflict, in the way that 'BioWomen'  and TransWomen seems to in certain places (from admittedly outside observation).    I don't know.  I fundamentally 'get' *Other*, wrong skinsuit, all that jazz.  I've got some *Other* going on. What I wonder, is where is the line between 'reasonable accommodation' of *Otherness* and where we just have to accept that We are, in fact, a weirdo that must navigate a strange land and deal with our own shit in a world that isn't ever really gonna get us, IS exactly?   I think...( wow, I've spent way too much time on a comment which will likely never be read or discussed, but whatever) I think across the board with Social Justice and Identity etc (which I am all in favor of)  we Also need to assess just how much other people need to give a shit about whatever we've got going on that doesn't apply to them, beyond basic human decency.  Some things, Yes need more attention and specific respect, some things, I think anyway, we've just gotta get right with the fact that we're an extreme minority weirdo (not so different than Nat's utopia thing).  I don't know what those lines Are.  But I think that's a discussion that needs to be had, without malice or affront.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"***Disclaimer: I say all of this with the idea that I hold views similar to feminists, but I also realize that feminism is a broad category. As such, I'd like to note that it is absolutely likely that there are other feminists who disagree with what I've said. I didn't mean for this to be a summarization of feminist view points. I just meant this as my perception through my own feminist lens. Also, at some point I use words with strong connotations (oppressor and suppressed). I don't mean it as intensely as it sounds, but I just don't know what other words fit there insofar as ease of understanding my point. /Disclaimer.***   'TERFs' bring up two genuine concerns I have/had that directly relate to feminism. One is that by dressing in overly/extremely feminine ways, transwomen were perpetuating a stereotype that only encourages the seemingly patriarchal ideal that women are supposed to go through extended effort in order to make themselves attractive for men. Meanwhile, I also hold that belief for women in general.   The bad thing is that dressing in overly feminine ways irritated me more with transwomen because it's as if they're saying that this is what it means to be a woman. This is what women are. This is how women act, behave, and dress. The summation of it is insulting. It's as if transwomen are the people in that Always commercial who are told to 'run like a girl' or 'throw like a girl' and they're doing it in a stereotypical 'girl' fashion. It felt, and perhaps still feels, like the 'oppressors' are taking something distinctly from those they're suppressing and trying to glorify in its suppressive qualities. It's like they're taking this unhealthy idea about our gender norms and are trying to keep us down by perpetuating it.   However, as soon as you said that transwomen feel the need to be overly feminine because they fear so much the idea of being mistaken as a man, it made sense. And I can understand that. So, I'll try not to be so bitter about it, especially because you're right; abolishing gender is a completely unrealistic ideal, and it shouldn't be fought at the expense of others.   The second issue I take is with the very idea of wanting to be or the idea that one might feel like one gender over another seems to be an idea that encourages these sexist divides, like one is putting a value and idea of what it means to be that gender vs one's own. And I think that's another issue that feminists have with the trans community. It is, at least, an issue I have with it.   I think transgenderism is a fruition of an unrealistic expectation of societal beliefs on what men and women should be. And being transgender is an acceptance and surrender to those expectations, which feels like a smack in a feminist's face. It feels cheap (in two ways, but for sake of length, I stick to the previous sentence). Really, it isn't fair to trans-people. Cisgendered people accept and surrender to these expectations daily - if not hourly. I succumb to these roles often, despite my best efforts to avoid doing so. Yet because it's normal and expected for cisgendered people to follow their assigned roles, it's harder to detect. Meanwhile, trans-people aren't a norm, which acts as a more pronounced reminder to feminists of the unrealistic roles and expectations that we're subjected to.   Basically, what I'm trying to say is I think you, ContraPoints, did not fairly represent those points (not maliciously, of course). Granted, the people you encountered were ignorant, so I understand the position you're coming from. But posing in stereotypical 'girlish' poses is insulting. That's not all we, women, do and are. I know that's not what you're saying and that isn't what people mean when they do it. But I think you can also understand why it would be interpreted that way.   TL;DR: There are serious concerns in regard to gender roles and transgenderism. However, I think that transpeople are not the source of it, rather they are the reflection of it. This creates a constant reminder and emphasis of our gender roles, which is frustrating for feminists. That doesn't mean it is okay to degrade, demean, or exclude transpeople. It simply means we need a better understanding of each other - and I do mean each other.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I'm one of those 'not particularly feminine cis women' and my take so far as been that I do see some of the more generic points made by 'gender critical' are somewhat interesting. But at the same time I do think that most radfems appear to be assholes and that any arguments they make are made in bad faith and hence it's pointless to discuss them. It's kind of like there are probably genuinely structural things worth criticising about islam as a religion and religion in general (just like with catholicism or hinduism), but right now the only people who want to obsessively talk about this topic are racist assholes.

"Anyway, here are my thoughts on some of those issues.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"1.) No gender/stereotypes. Again, this as all opinions is a pretty selfish one. As a woman with some non female typical hobbies/lacking a lot of female stereotypical hobbies like fashion or shopping, naturally I'm very much on board with 'these signifiers don't define me', aka boys can wear makeup and skirts and have long hair and act girly, women can wear pants, have short hair, act brash etc. So to me the way some transwomen express themselves does sometimes come off as trying to hard. Like maybe it is influenced by having to prove to the world what you are. Most cis women just have never had this experience and hence it feels very foreign to me. And it  often makes me wonder: how do you know that what you feel is 'woman'? If woman is just a vague feeling and not something you can enshrine in long hair or periods or babies or dresses? Like I get how one might feel that what has currently or what is approach as currently is not what one wants, but how do you know that the other you want is really 'woman'? Like, you are sure that you are not-A, but does that necessarily mean that it's B? Especially if it is really vague what B really is? How can you be sure that what you want or are is really B and not just the stereotype you built up about B? (admittedly I do have this feeling way more with how men portray women in movies and how transvestite dress, and I do think that transvestites and transwomen do have a very different feel in how they carry themselves) Can anybody really say for sure what B really is?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Based on things you have said in other videos my guess would be that maybe you have read books by women and maybe what they wrote resonated with you on a fundamental level in a way other things didn't? But to me that usually brings up more questions, surely no women can speak for all women? Are there really any traits that are or should be exclusive to women? Like being meek or being desired or having great hair. If anybody wants these, is there any reason why they should not be enjoyed by others? Are women just whole bunch of typical traits that usually go together and most women usually have at least some of them, though usually not all? (I should probably mention that I think being a woman in my eyes is neither something to strive for nor to run away from. To me it's just a trait)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I've read that hormons make a difference and cause big changes, which again makes me wonder, how can you sure which part is you and which part is hormones. Would hormones give the same stuff to anybody even if they didn't have the inclination before?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I do think that some element here is exposure though. It's not like there aren't any transwomen who regularly wear just baggy colorless clothes and have frumpy hairdoes and no makeup, it's just that you usually don't see them in the media/on youtube.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"2.) Childhood experience/Male privilege: I do think that boiling this down to male privilege is super stupid and I do think that acting like getting cat called at age 9 is somehow quintessentially woman is also stupid. But it seems to me that a lot of modern feminism is a lot about the media and the expectations put on women. Like what you get taught as you grow up, what behavior gets encouraged and discouraged, what the people around you expect of you, what kind of stubject you get encouraged to study. These don't even necessarily boil down to oppression even, but to me it still seems very different.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"And like I said I never had to struggled with proving my gender to people on a fundamental level, so that seems like a pretty core experience that most cis women are missing compared to trans women. So if chances on both sides are pretty good that we grew up very differently, aren't the chances also pretty great that the results and experiences are somewhat different? Again, it doesn't really offend me if you still want to call the result 'woman' either way, with just two different flavors, cis and trans. (but I guess this is the gay marriage debate all over again, where you have 'this things has been defined by these people for this many years' versus 'what are the fundamental traits that make marriage meaningful' and most people agreeing that those traits are 'people who want to share their lives and spend it together, ideally forever', but again, what are those traits for 'woman', if it's just a vague feeling, how can we ever be sure that my vague feeling ever matches your vague feeling? But surely there must be more to it than 'I think the word woman sounds kinda neat').","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"3.) Celebrating female bio stuff: My impression on the argument is that terfs claimed that there were some tumblr style trans types who complaining that bio stuff celebrating made them feel bad and left out and hence shouldn't be done. I have no idea how frequent that actually/whether it's actually false flagging. And I do think that as usual the reaction along the lines of 'Aha!!! this proves that trans women want to oppress cis women and shame us!!' is completely overblown. But that's what my impression was what the original arguments were about. That they were more like 'you were fat shaming/living out your thin privilege by posting pictures of your thinness or your weight loss success' style arguments.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"4.) Terfs say we act too male and too female at the same time: I think the main narrative of terfs is that (some) transwomen vibe male because the terfs feel that they exhibit some behavior that others have criticized as typically male. Like in modern feminism there seems to be a lot of debate on how men tend to act very entitled, from 'manspreading', to talking over women, interrupting them, making everything about themselves, whining if it is every not about them, being bossy, being competitive etc. So acting 'too feminine' can be seen as just another version of 'oh typical man, always overdoing everything.' Like it's kind of a 'Dances with Wolves' type situation where the outside comes into a community and immediately wants to become the leader and dominate the conversation. Then the whole debate 'it should be okay to reject a transwoman as a lover because she just does not like penis', again is usually framed 'this is just like the straight men who obsessively want to get into our pants'. Same with 'transwomen just like men get into your face or get physically argumentative or get into fights'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Again, as somebody reading the debates about this, I usually feel really skeptical how often that really happens and how much is just made up, hypothetical fear scenarios (a lot of these things remind me of anti-refugee/anti-immigrant/anti-muslim/anti-black debates, particularly also with the whole 'I'm just not attracted to [insert race], I can't help it' whining you see in some racist places).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"5.) Terf as an insult or slur: My impression is that it is clearly a pejorative word and I do feel like it seems to get thrown out sometimes quickly to stifle debate or criticism, but I also do think that there are a lot of real hardcore assholes out there who deserve to not get talked to. It's complicated. On one hand I do feel like a lot of these things are very personal feeling based, so in reality there probably are a lot of limits to whether there really is a lot of discuss. But I do think that there are cases where it seems to get thrown around very defensively. And just because a group has good reason to feel defensive doesn't always mean that it's necessarily always the best reaction in every situation.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I like to think there is a lot to gain in engaging with some of that earlier radfem material, and since Dworkin was fundamentally against abuse of power I highly doubt she would approve of her material being used to bully and abuse trans people or any other marginalised group.

We want them to thrive, to be happy, to be accepted by society. I am respectful of trans people's feelings, I don't deadname, I don't misgender. But gender crits just question the need of some people to transition as something that was caused by a sexist society. A society that hates feminine/gender-non-conforming men and masculine/gender-non-conforming women. Gender crits know that gender dysphoria exists but we ask if this psychological condition is fueled by society. If we lived in a society,that was much more accepting of gender-non-conforming people, would there be less people who suffer from gender dysphoria / would there be less people with the need to transition  ??? Terfs answer this question with yes and they are hated for it and misrepresented by you. You can't compare people who call themselves gender critical rather than TERFs to racists who call themselves race realists.  The core idea of racism is that people are defined by their race, the core idea of homophobia is that people are defined by their sex(you aren't allowed to be attracted to the other sex, you should conform to gendernorms); the core idea of gender criticals is that people AREN'T defined by their sex. That's why a lot of gender crits are LGB or detransitioners. Gender criticism isn't Transphobia, Gender criticism is a countermovement to homophobia and promotes acceptance of gender-non-conforming people.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The only time I have ever felt my tinge of gender critical feminism escape was surrounding the 'women's day protest'. I saw plenty of people I admire, of all identities, write off the protest as anti-trans and trans exclusionary. Particularly citing slogans of 'pussy power' and others that focused on female biology. It felt less of a stand for trans rights and more of a way of separating those who are more educated on trans-feminist theory and those who feel the oppression of our society but don't, due to what ever reason, have the chance to interact with feminism on a academic level. It also felt like a further way to shame others for their biology and owning their own biology; especially those who meant to only empower and not exclude.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This has been the most informative and important episode to me. While I am and have been supportive, (at least the last few years, wasn't always on the right side by any means) of the trans community, I did kinda feel like it clashed with the main idea that gender rolls are wrong in the first place. And I never feel like I can, or know how to ask some of these questions I have, because they could come off as offensive or like someone just trolling. I just want to be a better person and understand an idea or behavior foreign to my own, but I also don't want to hurt anyone. I was happy to understand better here but this took it even further and really opened my mind a bit more. Sure gender roles need to be fought but one battle at a time, and right now, there are more important battles. And maybe some gender rolls are ok, as long as they are never forced or expected.  Thanks for this video. This question has been tugging at my mind for a while now.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Aside from her transphobia, I find it abhorrent that Germaine Greer didn't immediately condemn FGM and called opposition to it as an 'attack on cultural identity'. It does nothing good for women, and it causes serious, life-long health issues, both physical and psychological. Cultural relativism ignoring the rights of the individual is bullshit. Yes, this is a hard and fast judgement that also has emotional aspects for me, but I don't think that is always a bad thing. All evidence indicates that it is harmful, and it stems from regressive and misogynistic ideas about purity. I can't take any 'feminist' seriously who thinks that the individual rights of women and AFAB people in general should ever take a backseat to cultural norms like that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hi hi hi Miss Points, as always another great video on a very interesting subject.   I do want to object to your 'gender abolition' section, and wanted to share another opinion with you. I'm a pansexual cis male who enjoys wearing traditionally women's clothing and supports beautiful transpeople like yourself, (imo not a dirty TERF) but I too think we should act towards the abolition of gender whole cloth. I believe that the expectation to act within the constructs of a gender binary acts as a form of social exploitation, and forces humans to restrict their personality into categories and refrain from embracing all their authentic interests and self-expression. The end of gender looks a lot more colorful than your bland, androgynous (but still cute) interpretation at 10:43   To borrow a quote from a ted talk by Scott Turner Schofield (an FtM transperson) URL  'I'm not for us all shaving our heads and wearing baggy clothing. I want us to be beautiful and I want us to celebrated using all the tools of gender and all of the tools of beauty that we have'  In fact, I think that the existence of gorgeous transpeople like you, Natalie, and even before your transition, is proof that people can and should express their beauty using traits associated with both femininity and masculinity.  Just wanted to share the fact that there's multiple viewpoints and reasons for wanting to abolish gender.

"Disclaimer: I am a (mostly) cis male.  I have to admit that I am considerably sympathetic to the radfem perspective on most issues, but not this one. What I observe in 'TERF'-y radfem discourse on this issue is not only transphobia, but anti-outgroup hatred that most visibly manifests in transphobia. But, make no mistake, they can be almost as vicious when talking about liberal feminists, anti-feminist women, women who perform femininity, and, of course, men. And they will tell you that it's justified, righteous hatred. Basically they engage in hatred of outgroups to build their ingroup. However, crucially, I think they are right about pornography and about prostitution, and equally crucially, I find their perspective on these issues notably absent from left-wing discourse if radfems are not present. And, they are often the very people building rape crisis centres and out there on the front lines fighting for abortion rights. So I very much don't want to see them ostracized from the left, even though I don't like the bigotry, and the legitimization of bigotry, that one often finds in their spaces. I have many disagreements with them outside of this - chiefly, metaphysical disagreements with their extreme social constructionist stance - but I have disagreements with anybody, and building political movements that can have success IS about overlooking such disagreements where possible.  The real kicker, though, is that the isolation of radical feminists from the left, even for real bigotry, _even when that segregation is self-imposed,_ is having a very pernicious effect, of amplifying the most bigoted and transphobic voices coming from that corner, and slowly erasing the distinction between radical feminist and 'TERF.' Which, by the way, is a term I don't like. On the other hand, I see problematic demonization and hatred coming from their opponents as well. 'Punch a TERF' is a vile notion, and you can see that easily enough if you visit the Chapo Trap House subreddit, or innumerable other left-wing hangouts that are in theory supposed to be pro-feminist. Further, while I have always considered myself strongly sympathetic to trans issues and trans rights, I don't agree with some of the new fringe ideas that have come out of queer theory - like the idea that you are however you choose to identify, and you get to define your own pronouns, and if anybody doesn't respect your they/them pronouns then they are a TERF and are fair game to be demonized. I think this is crazy and it's divorced from the struggles of most trans people who have always understood that changing one's appearance and social performativity is how one gains acceptance as a member of one's target gender, whether one 'passes' or not. In other words it's the group who decides what gender you are, not you. This is, of course, problematic for people who feel that their internal state doesn't align with their external presentation.  I guess I would just like to see more respect on all sides, and fewer hard lines in the sand. LGBT activists in leftist political parties have always understood the need to make alliances with progressive groups and individuals who have unfortunate blind spots and bigoted attitudes. I guess there is a sense that in 2019 we shouldn't have to do this, that anybody who doesn't accept you as you are can not only take a hike, but has no place in civil society. I don't like any kind of bigotry but I also know that the world is full of bigots. Most racists, sexists, and homophobes who are otherwise progressive find ways to mask their prejudices. It's increasingly difficult for transphobes to do this. I'm rambling now so I guess I'll stop. Thanks for the video, Natalie, I enjoyed it!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hi contrapoints! I hope you'll find this amongst the deluge of comments you get.  I wanted to note that even medical language is not going far enough. The hospital where I had my kid completely erases trans men when it comes to pregnancy. The only place they concede that a scary tran can have a baby is on the exit survey, and the only gender options are 'female' and 'non-binary'. (Makes the pride flag they were flying outside a bit hypocritical)  So yeah, it's frustrating that because of terf panic over 'pregnant people' (what's wrong with the phrase 'women and pregnant people'? idk) instead of a nice slightly painful confession of being non-binary at my next midwife appointment, it happened in tears, ten minutes before an emergency c-section.

"What really bothers me about TERF ideology is that they can follow the 'abolish gender' mentality without putting down trans people. I don't think gender or biological sex should matter all that much and I also believe trans people should be allowed to dress however they want without the anxiety of whether they pass or not. Parents should raise their kids with the freedom to explore their identity and not let social norms hold them back.   It's also not like trans people will suddenly be comfortable with the body they have just because gender is abolished, making everything gender neutral isn't going to eliminate a basic desire to want to look and feel a certain way.   Heck, those who believe gender should be abolished shouldn't have to give a shit about someone using a different pronoun. If pronouns can be interchangeable and have no regards for biology then that's a great argument for why gender is irrelevant and based on a pair of arbitrary standards that aren't even consistent. It demonstrates that gender roles aren't biological, anyone can take on the role of a man, woman, both or neither and qualify as such. That is already one step closer to abolishing gender and is way more effective than putting down trans people who want to dress in hypermasc/fem ways.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The great thing about trans women is that you could have been men but you chose to be women with all the bullshit that comes with it because you know it's fucking great to be a woman. And you are not afraid to live out your femininity in all its 'pretty' and 'less pretty' aspects, because you are not scared to be called sluts, or considered a naive virgin or not taken seriously for being too feminine or not being considered desirable for not being feminine enough. Because as former males you know all these misogynistic standards put on us are bullshit. You know all these rules about how women should behave to be considered worthy are just a trick to control us and that the moment you satisfy one you inevitably fail at the other. You also don't have the need to constantly prove to men that you are intellectually as capable as them, because well, you were men. Terfs on the other hand view womanhood as a cage which was forced upon them and they hate it and they hate anyone voluntarily coming into the cage and celebrating it. They have internalised the doubts and hatred for their own gender from the oppressors. They only know how to fight the cage by screaming about their suffering or by trying to be like their oppressors. Since you have a better way of being a woman, one which inevitably rests on pursuing personal freedom, you crush their view of the world. I on the other hand appreciate very much your contribution to our gender. As a woman, you make me feel better about being in my gender. You destroy the feelings of frustration of being a woman - your freedom makes me feel free. So thank you. As for experiencing sexual trauma as a girl as a qualifier of being a woman, that is some serious bull. Growing up in a post-communist society I have never experienced trauma or discrimination as a child based on my gender, nor did I experience being afraid based on gender because our society was very safe in general. It was only when I came to live in the West as an adult that misogyny started being shoved down my throat. I don't believe that makes me any less of a woman. Plus if someone has always considered themselves a woman I am pretty sure they have internalised the suffering of women around them at least to an extent, as their own.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's interesting how some persons are annoyed with terms like 'pregnant people' and 'menstruators' but have let 'men who have sex with men' become so commonplace that the medical profession has turned it into a TLA. The terms have use. They are instructive to medical practitioners, a fair amount of whom are quite clueless and went to medical school for the wrong reasons, for example; a parent's love, enhanced dating options, or that infamous Beemer. Anyway, the terms! They get to the heart of the issue. If I'm talking to an MSM about STIs, it's because I'm concerned about risk of STIs; sexually transmitted infections. Thus, bicurious men who do not have sex with men need not have this conversation. (at this level; everyone sexually active is at risk of STIs, kiddies) If I am talking to a woman (not a menstruator) about altering diet to increase iron intake during menstruation to allow the body to more effectively replace blood lost in the process, this conversation is not assistive to a trans woman or a post-menopausal cis woman. Use of the terminology reinforces this idea, and I have had some coworkers sorely needing this basic level of instruction. Be thankful for these terms, patients, they are present for your benefit.   Thanks for another great video, Ms. Wynn!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Your point starting at about 9:20 regarding femininity, womanhood, gender-non-conformity, and the question about why feminists don't leave comments on Kardashian pictures regarding enforcing gendered norms by dressing fancy finally clarified a prejudice I've been struggling with for a while. As you said, I was/am one of those non-gender-conforming-cis-women who kind of side-eye the High Femme aesthetic many trans women adopt.    I've struggled with this because having the 'freedom' and courage to craft my own gender expression rather than conforming to feminine expectations has been a major part of my process of maturing and defining myself as a woman in our society. My girlhood, and especially my adolescence, was in many ways defined by defying those stereotypes and defending my clothing choices and (lack of) make-up and hair styles, mostly against other women and girls, while still identifying as a straight, cis woman rather than a lesbian. I was repeatedly, falsely, clocked as a lesbian in high school and college, and even accused of having a beard boyfriend, which made me very angry on my own behalf and on behalf of actual lesbians. It also made me reluctant to come out as bi for fear I'd be 'confirming' everyone's 'suspicions' about how I wasn't 'really a woman', or not the right kind of woman, i.e. a straight woman.   So I found it a bit off-putting to see my gender seemingly distilled into very shallow signifiers like fancy hair, nails, and makeup, which have been used by the patriarchal society to dismiss women as being 'too frivolous' and 'too superficial' while simultaneously demanding that women dress well and put heavy emphasis on how our appearance defines, or is at least heavily influences, our worth as humans. (And also, I realized an embarrassingly few years ago that identifying expertise in fashion, make-up, and hair styling as 'shallow' pursuits, or indicating superficiality on the part of people who excel at these skills, is also a symptom of our cultural misogyny, dismissing these disciplines as somehow more venal or disposable than other art, because their main devotees are women and gay men.)  Your explanation of why many trans women choose High Femme looks to make it crystal-clear what gender they are presenting as makes perfect sense. But the Kardashian example really clarified that I'd been staring 'downstream' at people who were negatively affected by societal misogyny and transphobia, rather than looking 'upstream' at the cultural messages and gatekeeping used to keep women obsessed with presenting as 'proper' women, forcing all of us, cis, trans, straight, lesbian, bi, into uncomfortable roles that don't fit the people we really want to be. Thanks so much for this video.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i know for me that the fear of men and the childhood lessons on how to survive  (ie: don't go to the bathroom alone, walk with my keys in my knuckles, always stay in lighted areas, don't go anywhere alone at night ect) reinforced my transphobia. now as shitty as those lessons are they're sadly probably needed, but it wasn't until my trans teacher explained why it was okay for her to use the bathroom that i really understood. Now i see the whole bathroom argument for what it is: hate and fear.  One reason it was hard for me to accept myself as non-binary was i felt like i was turning my back on women and their struggles, like i was leaving them.

Like you can wish you live in New York but can't call yourself a New Yorker until you actually MOVE to New York.

"I've wondered about a lot of these sorts of questions, especially the one about how transwomen usually seem to go for feminine stereotypes. But the idea that they have to basically shoot for the moon in the case they might be able to land among the stars makes sense. It is still a shame that is seemingly? the only way they feel they can actually be recognised as a woman. But perhaps we are not quite up to the point of gender being viewed simply as an expression as opposed to something mandatory yet. People need to get used to the idea (for lack of a better phrase) that gender and sex aren't so concretely linked before we can move past that altogether I think. Although, saying things like people with vaginas seems really awkward to say, but at the same time saying females (as in based on sex, not gender) is exclusive to transwomen or transmen? (I'm not sure which, maybe both?) Can anyone help me with this last part?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"How is 'I live as a woman' different to 'I am a man who lives as though I were a woman?'  Why can we not just accept that there are people born male and born female, and people born intersex, who to be themselves live as though they were the opposite sex or somewhere in between? When we label people as transman and transwoman I think what we are actually doing is saying that these people are only valid if they are perceived as members of the opposite sex.  This is stupid and wrong.  You're still valid if you're a boy who lives as a girl and vice versa. You're still valid if your identity and biology don't align.  Gender-critical stuff basically says 'a transman is not male and a transwoman is not female, and that's ok' Because from a gender-critical perspective you should be free to express yourself as you wish and not face prejudice because of that, regardless of your biology. A transman expands what it means to be female, and a transwoman expands what it means to be male. And what's wrong with that?   Ok time for the critiques. 1. Holocaust denial versus Gender critical. Saying that there are two sexes, is nothing like holocaust denial. Seriously. What the fuck was that?  2. Abolishing gender is a utopian project requiring massive systemic change. Yes it is. Hence radical feminism. But the comparison to 'abolish borders' is not equivalent. Borders have not always existed. X and Y chromosomes, people born in between the typical XX, XY, and people who identify as the other sex to the one they are, pretty much have existed for as long as human civilisation at least. Also then saying 'denying transpeople their gender identity is like denying citizenship because abolish borders' No sorry, it's not at all. The metaphor is too imprecise. First of all, who is denying anyone their identity? Again the problem comes back to whether or not the terms man and woman refer to biological sex, or gender identity. If they refer to biological sex, it's not about 'denying' anything because 'deny' implies there is something true or due which someone is denying. Male and Female are not the same thing.  If they refer to internal identity, then you can make the argument that someone is 'denying' that someone else identifies as man or woman.  Being female is a biological reality and so is being male. I don't understand why I should have to start saying that one is the other, which is untrue, just because it makes someone feel better to deny their biological reality. These are my thoughts. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't choose to treat someone as they want to be treated. Look at it this way, I don't believe in god because I see no evidence for it, and I don't believe that transwomen are femal or transmen are male for the same reason. That doesn't mean I want to go around abolishing religion or telling every catholic or buddhist I meet that their beliefs are hokum. I don't live inside other people's internal realities. But being told I have to include catholics in the same category as atheists is just as hilarious to me as having to say that male is female and vice versa.  Men can present as women and women as men and go about their lives in peace. But they can't, at current levels of tech, be the other. I hope someday they can!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think u have a really good sense of humor, and ur channel is always entertaining. I respect ur honesty, and that u don't seem to have a cultish mentality, and I love ur hilarious sense of humor. In the effort of having a constructive dialogue where each may hopefully understand the other side better I feel that I should say some things to clear the air.    Often times questions are not meant to disparage trans ppl but, simply to wrap one's head around it. Then when trans act like any views different from their own, or any questions are evil, it shuts down healthy dialogue and creates unnecessary hostility leading to a toxic environment between trans and not trans. There is a difference in believing certain things, and being disparaging, or having malice towards someone. Just b/c one believes ur not a woman doesn't mean they believe ur an abomination, think ur any less valuable as a human being, any less of a beautiful soul, or even hold hostility towards u. A man is far more likely to view u as 'monster gender' than a woman is, unless she's had bad experiences w/ trans. One can view u as a feminine man, and still love the fk outta u, and appreciate u as a human being, and not see u as a freak. I think the tendency to label those w/ different views as hostile enemies (or terfs or transphobes) is a self-fulfilling prophecy that only burns bridges instead of uniting. I think b/c trans ppl have been bullied it makes them as a community overly sensitive, and mistake things as malice when they're really not intended that way. Likewise us 'terfs' may take something a certain way when they don't understand the intentions behind it which are also rooted in negative experiences. Both sides can project the trauma of their past experiences to one another, and that can cause conflict. I think ppl should be able to atd w/o being disrespectful or hateful towards one another, and realize despite all our differences that we are all one, and best profit in peace and love.    The terms TIMs and TIFs are actually supposed to be the LEAST hurtful terms as they are basically stating what both sides believe in a non-mocking fashioned. If someone was trying to be hurtful they would just say tranny, crossdresser, heshe, and ect. But really though, when trans ppl use the term TERF, is it really any better? Esp. when u nvr see anyone say things like 'punch all TIMs' 'kill all TIMs', and ect.    What you are saying about trans metaphorically claiming to have female brains, may be true for u, BUT alot of trans mean it quite literally, and will talk about studies, even though there haven't been very many studies on trans done before cross sex hormones, and although the gay male brain is more feminine the the hypothalamus and vice versa this wouldn't apply to a hetero male transwoman who called themselves a lesbians though. Also some transwoman do think that feminine clothes and being female are actually the same, like that 'it's MA'AM' guy, or Catlyn Jenner, Riley J Dennis, and those that identify as trans but don't want to get the surgery, and insist that their body's female b/c they identify as a woman. Ik u obv hate them and cringe just as much as we do b/c ur one of the good ones, not one of those superficial hivemind idiots, that...unfortunately there are alot of. While many trans will say they understand sex and gender are different things, many will conflate the two, calling lesbians transphobes (and it's not just Riley J Dennis) b/c we don't want to suck or fk d!cks (even though after the operation that might not a problem b/c they'd have a constructed vagina, some insist they're penises are a female part and they're female confusing sex and gender). I think this is very much a source of contention. It annoys me as a lesbian when they try to call us terfs for not fking them, and it also gives good trans ppl a bad name.     I think it's good that u aren't of the hivemind, and are open and honest w/ the fact u weren't raised as a girl, b/c it's open, and honest. 'Terfs' don't wish to compete in the oppression olympics, and I agree that it's stupid to make it a competition when all should try to empathize w/ one another. Often when one points out women are oppressed b/c of sex and not gender, and points out 'male privilege' it's in response to delusions of trans ppl thinking 'cis women's privilege' is a real thing that exist, that genuine safety concerns are excuses (and we wish to point out u only think they're excuses b/c u have not had the experiences we had), that TRA's at the women's march demanding they get the vulva's off everything, and start calling their vagina's 'front holes', and ect. is unreasonable, ect. Things like this seem very misogynist, and creates Terfs, as well as the fact that many  trans want women to march for them but not march for the women. Pointing out these things, how u were raised as a male, is also to drive home the point that u most likely don't understand the safety concerns as being real b/c boys and men don't have to look over their shoulder like girls and women do as a whole, and to be so dismissive that u so naively think that it's just an excuse to make trans ppl feel bad, when in fact, b/c of biology, it is  real concern. U see, even if u could guarantee every real trans person was peaceful (which LMAO they're far from peaceful), u'd still have natural men who are misogynist rapist taking advantage of the fact they can enter a woman's bathroom just by declaring themselves trans b/c of identity politics.  Women are protective of their spaces not bc they hate u, but b/c we learned thru experiences that we need to be. Even disagreeing w/ trans ppl can get women killed or beat, so to me this just emphasizes the fact they shouldn't be included in the space. Women can disagree w/ eachother, and still keep the peace, TIMs want any 'TERF' that disagrees w/ them dead, not for bullying, but just for having a different point of view.    Hilarious point on the abolishing gender thing. LOL Ofc uk 'abolishing gender'' does not mean ''pretending the human species doesn't have two sexes''... ''Abolishing gender'' means getting rid of gendered stereotypes, and becoming a freer society. The fact that males and females physically look a certain way or sound a certain way (high or low voiced) isn't really a stereotype or social construct. Often questions arise b/c many transwomen while dressing stereotypically feminine, don't seem to think like a woman, or as u put it, have the soul of a woman. For instance there are many TRA's that will get violent w/ lesbian women for not liking d!ck, or what have u, and they get loud and violent, or they'll go to Rose McGowan's book signing only to interrupt her rudely screaming about transwomen's oppression when she hasn't done $h!t to them, then that trans person will be found out as a rapist. This is when women will reach PEAK trans and become a terf. Alas not all trans are bad, but there's alot of trans ppl that seem to be misogynist and wanna take everything out on women, which is another reason why 'terfs' will call out male privilege and socialization. The contempt they have calling out imaginary 'cis women privilege' when they have had male privilege, even if not as much at their more masculine male counterparts, and coming up w/ words like terf to berade women just for not believing the same way....while many men don't just disbelieve in trans ideology but brutally kill and rape them, leaves many women resentful. I think if we all felt respected, there would be alot less of this war of worlds.    Gender abolitionist and transphobia aren't really the same thing, and to think it is is just oversensativity on ur part. The gender abolitionist  sees a gnc person and thinks 'cool u do u'. The transphobe wants to beat that gnc person up, or to force them into a stereotypical role. The gender abolitionist person thinks there should be more gnc ppl. However if u were to say to them 'this is what makes me a woman or man, these clothes, and these mannerisms' they wouldn't would disagree and say, 'gender roles are bs, I believe your biology is what makes u a man or woman.' Again, this point of view isn't b/c we hate u, or want u to not exist. We just don't agree on the definitions, u see womanhood and manhood as gender, as we see it as sex and consider this a term of biology. Disagreeing isn't a form of hate, or the same as agreeing w/ POS that bully u and want u dead. I understand that bulling for @$$holes and trauma has made u hyper sensitive but, in reality I want every good person to be treated w/ love and kindness. I don't want non-violent trans ppl to be hurt or killed.   I think if more trans ppl existed like u there would be ALOT less transphobia. There are many good trans ppl out there but, sadly alot of bad overly aggressive ironically misogynist ones give trans ppl a bad name. This is unfortunate.I hope one day ppl will put aside their petty differences, and be as one.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Finally someone goes to the heart of transphobia, my internal, and others external disgust masked as critical gender reasoning. Breaking down everything to oversimplified stereotypes, prescribing delusion, or attacking how we present to pass, or how we present once we pass. I've done this to myself for decades, mix confused feelings to prescription and tagging by both 'professionals' and the average person alike. First it was, 'stop calling yourself a boy, you're a girl,' to 'the sexual abuse you suffered is why you hide behind presenting masculine', 'you still like *insert non gender conforming thing or act* see! You're confused!'. These are just the more recent ones after came out as a trans man. Before it was 'why I have homosexual tendencies is because I was molested by a female', 'you can't be bisexual, only gay or striaght', 'don't have a *insert masculine thing* they'll think you're a dyke!'. And when I finally stopped dismissing all of the personal tells of being transgender I didn't tick every box. I loved pink and was a girly girl until puberty, I grew up liking both males and females, and I continue to like non gender comforming things. So now I'm getting clocked as a lesbian or a gay man, and my transphobia family is trying to refer to this as a phase I will one day grow out of.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The funniest part of being a trans man who is open about trans is how many people assume I'm a trans woman who is passing badly. I had one guy who literally bear hugged me regularly not realise I wasn't a cis dude until I excitedly started talking about my voice FINALLY STARTING TO DROP LIKE 7 MONTHS IN FUCK. People are TERRIBLE at clocking gender and they never learn if they are right or wrong about who they clock in public, so they just assume they've found All the Transes when they've actually just decided to call a burly cis lady sir. Which happened to me, before I started transitioning. I DID have a girlhood, and it was full of people either assuming I was a boy or treating me as invisible. I was a wrestler body type who built more muscle than two thirds of the boys I knew, I was brick-shit-house and girls aren't that, so I didn't exist to people. Fuck people talking about cat-calling as a universal experience of girlhood, when actually it's more nuanced than that and you have young girls wondering what's wrong with them because they aren't targets for that like they're supposed to be.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hey, thank you for this. Most of your videos address right-wing arguments that I would never be susceptible to. This one, though, addressed some that, as a post-menopausal cis-feminist (so, a woman and not a 'menstruator'), I have thought and had questions about. Specifically, I've had the thought that if we didn't have such rigid gender roles and expectations, if girls and boys weren't told 'boys don't do that' or 'girls don't do that' growing up, if we didn't smack down 'feminine' men or 'masculine' women, would anybody feel like they needed to be a different sex than what they were assigned at birth? Does the existence of more and more openly trans people actually represent a failure of feminism, because of that?  I've never spent time in any of the hate-filled online spaces you describe, so I appreciate becoming aware of how this stuff is weaponized, and I really got something from your 'abolish borders' analogy. Also, I read about trans activists protesting 'The Vagina Monologues' because not all women have vaginas, and thought that was ridiculous. But it's been decades since I've been a 'campus activist,' and I suspect that story is an outlier, another something exaggerated and weaponized by the right. Anyway, I really like your addressing these ideas both seriously and  irreverently, in good 'balance.'  You go, girl!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"When she says radical feminists that think the only difference between men and women are sex differences and that gender is a patriarchal construct, does that mean when Jordan Peterson pretty much uses the same exact language he is actually referring to TERFs? I never picked up on that before because I thought that social constructionist theories of gender are actually asserting that and in my gender class the only way my professor said this might be trans exclusionary is that trans people might say they 'feel they were born in the wrong body,' which I agree is likely metaphorical or speech that might not necessarily be accurate but is accurate in expressing the feeling.  I'm confused because I always thought that social constructionist theories, especially ones that argue how women are defined by men, did seem a bit uncomfortable to me because of how they seem to speak about gender in a really rigid way. I chalked that up to how many of what I read was not written in the last 10 years. Lastly, I always thought that these theories we are talking about do have room for non-binary identities because it seems to me that if gender is a social construct surrounding the natural fact of differences between men and women, then, given that these differences can be overcome, the social differences can also be overcome. So am I confused? Sorry for long comment","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Even as a cis woman, gender and I have an interesting relationship. As a kid I was taught by my (polarizingly) feminist relatives that I could not like skirts, makeup, the color pink,or any other feminine thing. But as I grew older, I realized I did like those things. Makeup is fun to wear as long as I'm wearing it because I like to, pink is a great color, and... well, no, I still hate skirts. They're uncomfortable. But what that taught me was that everyone identifies with and expresses their gender in different ways, and there's nothing wrong with expressing it in traditionally/patriarchally approved ways. TDLR? Hearing TERFs say trans women are faking womanhood by dressing the way that they feel the most comfortable sounds a hell of a lot like my aunt telling me I'm prescribing to patriarchal values by wearing lip stick.

And actually, although I am fully aware of how insensitive speech toward minority groups can be dangerous or become a slippery slope toward actual real life repercussions or violence toward these groups, generally I support the 'right wing' position that the 'snowflakes' need to toughen up and deal with the insults hurled their way. No one is doing him/her/them self a favor by shedding tears over what some dumbass has to say about him/her/them.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"All I can say is that my male experience has been nothing but cold, uncaring apathy. Nobody cares about my life, my pain, or whether I even survive, unless I am somehow providing value to them and as soon as I don't, they cast me aside. The moment I threaten their world view, suggest men have institutional disadvantages, legal discrimination and suffer from all the nasty social hatred and assaults on our very being (something one would expect trans people to understand) that's been going on lately, I get attacked and have a witch hunt hate mob going after my livelihood...  Tell me all about my male privilege. No, males don't have privilege, they have thier own shit to deal with. The grass is greener syndrome I'll call it. You want men to stop hitting on you? Too bad. Make yourself hideous. We men don't get hit on and the ones that do, are not representative of the 90% of men. Unlike women, who get more attention than an equally attractive man could ever dream of. Hell, even mildly above average women get more attention than a top tier man.   You wanna transition? Okay, make an effort and don't freak out when you're misgendered. Show the normies you aren't a threat and they'll at least leave you alone. You won't have that problem from me at least. I have sympathy for you.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think one of the main problems in society is the 'fear' of having to accept more gender orientations of people and/or that their own gender is somehow under threat? This is common in other issues too, such as racism. We seem to fear what we don't understand and this is a good thing to work at to build bridges with others who are different to what mainstream society calls 'normal'. (wow, it's a minefield of feeling like having to be careful what to say, but I'm no expert and please forgive me if I come across in an inappropriate way, I am a fair, nice person.. sort of hehe).  I hope that the future continues to make more room for people of different sexual orientations / genders/ whatever we can call it :) But it is something that we should embrace and respect. Cutting through controversy, let's see how society has been told to respect diversity amongst people with mental illnesses, or disabilities; Individuals would be chased out of town for trolling a disabled person, or someone who is 'different' tends to get called 'weird' and is isolated from the 'popular group'. It's not to say that gender orientation is a disability, but what I mean is we should be more educated and accepting of people who identify as a certain gender, because they are people!!! People who have just the same goals of enjoyment in life as everyone else.  ughh, if only the world was a nicer place eh? heh. It's nice to see people on the internet trying to forge a way forward into the future of society and you are giving a platform for others in leading by example, and with some intelligent humour too :)  All the best.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"First let me say that I love, love, love all your work. My girlfriend and I await your new videos eagerly every month and I put them on at night to fall asleep to often. Thank you for being a literal genius. That being said, I was a little let down with this one and wanted to provide some feedback. In other videos where you break down bad ideas (I'm thinking Jordan Peterson) you engage with those ideas sincerely while poking a little lighthearted fun at those who embrace them, and I love that. Here though I felt you started out claiming to engage TERFy ideas in good faith but that quickly that no longer seems true. Like, yes the way that TERFs say 'abolish gender' when really TERFs mean 'abolish trans people' is whack, but lampooning the idea of abolishing gender as hard as you do takes attention away from the gravity of what they really mean (abolish trans people) and, as you later say, is more likely to provoke infighting between cis and trans folks at a time where we need to stand together. This is just one example; I'm not as good as arguing as you (few are) so I won't go on for too long. And also maybe I'm misunderstanding what you were trying to do here. But look: I too believe TERFs deserve a good dragging and I hope you had fun doing so. If you wanna really argue in good faith while poking fun, do that, or if you wanna totally skewer folks within an inch of their lives, do that, but be honest. I know you're good at both so I trust you will.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"About the 'abolish gender' thing:  I personally believe in it, and as far as I'm concerned, I do not discriminate against transsexuals or harass them (and yes, I am not the one to judge about that obviously). But to me it's more about not seeing gender as this binary 'truth', but just realise it's a constructed system designed to categorise people. And categorisation of people is always the very beginning of opression, as is identity in general. Which is why I don't care what gender I am, even though I don't think anyone will ever assume I'm anything but cis-male. But I don't want that gender assigned to me, I don't want the boundaries of what is considered male, what is considered female, cis, trans, straight, queer, bi - I just want to be me. And *that's* what I believe in when I say 'abolish gender': That nobody should have a role assigned to them at birth, that nobody should have to even pick one of the roles, but for everyone to be able to do anything that is not harmful without having to conform to some 'role' or 'identity'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I love you and your channel so much. I struggled forever with my own gender identity and it made me bitter about a lot of things. To me, for a time, men transitioning to women was essentially black face. I hated being a woman, I hated  feeling like less than a man, I felt that I was too unattractive and unwilling to conform to gender norms to be loved by a man but was still cat called and harassed and abused because (from what I could tell) 'any hole's a hole'. I wasn't comfortable with my attraction to women and being sexually assaulted by them only drove my insecurities home harder. I wanted to have been born a man and I dressed as one and used male pronouns but felt I would never be satisfied with that because, to me, it would never be real. When I saw strong, beautiful trans women being strong, beautiful trans women in my youth... well I was pretty pissed. Here were these men, so happy to be what I hated being and doing it better than I could. To me, they were the privileged men who abused me changing into the prettier, more confident women that abused me but without ever having to experience any of the struggles that I had gone through to get there. I didn't hate them, I didn't want them to stop doing what made them happy, but there was bitter indifference, confusion, and no small amount of jealousy.   It took a long time for me to look inside myself and identify where my own trauma and self loathing was making me into an angry person. I also had to properly educate myself.

"What is a woman or a man, really? What are we identifying as? That's the only thing that I don't understand. It has nothing to do with privilege to me. I don't mind trans rights or seeing them thrive , but I don't see how changing anything about yourself makes you different from what you are born as. You can live through life however you want, it doesn't change anything. I can see someone is trans and still use the proper pronouns because I don't want to fuck up their day for no reason. No matter what though, they'll also be that sex to me. They're not the same as cis people and I think that's okay. I get that we aren't socially far enough for people to just be who you want. I think it's because I was really masculine as a kid and the only thing that made sense was just that I was born that way. It didn't matter that I wasn't into anything ' feminine ' because I'm a female.  I really hate being on the wrong side of history, but no matter what I try, I just can't get it. It's not for me to get though I guess. It's just about what makes others FEEL better . It's not about what's real or what makes sense I guess. Everything that you said about terfs are real though. I find myself constantly having to defend trans people with my family even when I don't believe that gender and sex will ever be the same when switched. I keep trying to solve my cognitive dissonance but I've been failing so far on that point and only that point. Some people are absolutely insane when they're talking about trans people though so it's hard to be in the other side when the people are so ignorant and cruel.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I think it's being skeptical of gender norms is healthy and the idea of living in a more 'genderless' society is to me not about living in a world that is robotic and dehumanizing. There is nothing dehumanizing about the androgyny of Prince, Davide Bowie, and Grace Jones. I'm not saying that all trans people should be androgynous, trans people should be treated the same way cis people are with their identity and gender expression.  However, I don't want to get to point where the validity of trans people is being judged by how well they assimilate to mainstream cis beliefs on what makes someone a woman or make someone a man.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I hope you can see the humour in me saying #notallterfs - but in fact there are plenty of people out there that will disagree with your ontology and *some* of its legal implications but actually still want you to live a good and happy life, overall feeling safe.

"It is disappointing and falacious (the classical ad hominem) how you start the video by insinuating that radical feminists have been 'traumatised' by men and that is why they hold their 'flawed' views. Quite the same argument as those who say trans people are so because they were molested as children. There is a biological and surely physiological explanation to transgender experiences, unless you believe in some supernatural impetus, and this is why negating their reality is not only inconsiderate (and even dangerous, I do not intend to frivolize), but also factually incorrect. That being said, the trans discourse many times presents the traditional genders roles as the elements that define the person's identity, thus validating these traditional gender roles. No, make-up, being soft spoken and wanting to shop in the women's section does not make you a woman. Surely the feeling is more profund and must have something to do with the structure of the brain, and the person does feel like a woman, but the rethoric around often reinforces and validates traditional gender roles and stereotypes- which, yes, are a contingent and very harmful patriarchal creation. Also, it is blunt disrespect- and also untruthful- to minimize the actual biological experience of being a woman, with all that entails and that you have never experienced in the same fashion. Sometimes what I hear is people used to live with all the entitlement that being male grants in our society, wanting to lecture those who have only and absolutely experienced being female on how to be female. You win the 'feminity' contest, though: I do not need femininity because I am female, I have nothing to prove nor I need to justify that fact. And probably neither do you! I do recognize that transgender women do feel as women and deserve respect. Just show respect yourself to women who may point out  that there are realities you may not share or understand. This is like the debate about transgender women competing in professional, high-level female sports: sure, after male puberty you are going to have an enormous advantage and push many fellow athletes aside, so much for sorority. For fun or on a different scale we can all play,  that should be a given, but in that case people's careers are at stake, for instance. 'Man hating', such extraordinary language. You may start calling cis-women feminazis along those lines. The excerpt you showed at the beginning was very hostile and insensitive (and deserves criticism), but to have you low-key saying that people who are critical of genderism- and who vindicate the trascendence and importance of their physical reality- do so because they were molested is also quite problematic.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"This may have been my favorite Contrapoints video so far, at least 10 or 15 times I had to pause and rewind and laugh over and over at a funny joke, and just as many times rewound to soak in the glory of Natalie's intelligent discourse. My life has been improved a million times more with her in it.    As to the actual discussion, I had never actually heard of TERFs before Natalie's videos introduced me a while ago but as a cis female feminist it always riles me up that there are women out there giving the title a bad name by disguising their transphobia as feminism. I don't associate with that, I don't relate to that, trans women experience the world the same way cis women do, and isn't the whole crux of feminism your experiences? Feminism is supposed to be about men and women being equal, and trans men and women are included in that as well as gender fluid, non binary, and others within our gender/sexuality spectrum. The whole point is supposed to be EQUALITY, by definition TERFs aren't feminists, they're cisgendered female superiority activists. I already had this discussion when it came to just simply men vs women in that usually the argument is that radical feminists see themselves as superior to men and that's something I've seen before and it's bad enough, but to also say you're better than trans men and women just makes you like a white nationalist but for cisgendered women.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thank you for this video. I needed this, I actually need more too. I had a hard childhood (not compared to other people of course) in a nuclear family as the only girl with an older baby boomer mother and father who pushed me into bows and stockings and 'womanly' duties from a very young age and I have a lot of anger. A lot. Directed at people who say 'what a woman should be'. I wasnt allowed outside of that girl sphere. Everything was expected of me. Everything I did wrong 'isnt what ladies do' Sometimes I feel like I was pushed so much into the oppressive parts of femininity that I don't understand why anyone would want to take it on. I feel angry when someone else doesnt understand MY oppression. That im 33 and still suffer with unpacking my bullshit. But I know that's my own self-centered view, because I'm hurt by how my parents limited me, I feel like I didn't fight back enough. I feel like I was weak, I am still weak. I feel like femininity failed me, but it is the only tool I have. Resentment mixed with confusion. My mother was a 'Perfect Wife' As an adult, the only skills I was taught was cooking from scratch, separating laundry, wrapping Christmas presents, throwing a dinner party, gardening, dressing up, how to shop for sales, how to sleep in curlers (thats right), how to make a bed and table (a big one with my mother). Don't get me started on their white-bubbles (read: RACISM). The last couple years I have felt like some trans women didnt understand my childhood oppression although as a *die-hard feminist* I would never say that to any of my lgbt friends because I consider myself a LGBT ally. I've always supported trans people because even if I didnt always understand every single detail of the trans experience, I knew it was my responsibility to educate myself and open myself to trusting trans women on my own. I went to college, I have my little English degree, I took Feminism 101. Because I knew I was being self-centered I was afraid to ask questions, I never want to seem homophobic, because I am a big supporter in my community of lgbt rights. Anyway, your video helped me unpack. I want you to know that I love you, and that you have helped me do that, and I am going to try to keep fixing myself and helping to make the world a safer place for me, you, and all women.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Humans are not always born with either XX or XY chromosomes. Humans aren't always born with a penis or vagina. Sex and gender aren't binary.  Many people are born with only XX or XY sex chromosomes. Others have XXY, XYY, XXX, XXXY and many, many other variations. The idea that all humans are born with one of two genders dictated by their sex chromosomes is absurd, and anyone who pushes that idea has no grasp on the science they are attempting to wield as evidence.  Welcome to the world of intersex people. In the past, people have called them 'hermaphrodites', but they don't like it, and it's inaccurate for a lot of them. The term hermaphrodite is a compound of Hermes and Aphrodite, one male and one female god, meaning intersex people are half male and half female, and like I said, that isn't accurate.   In the past, doctors who delivered babies with 'ambiguous genitalia' would make snap decisions immediately following birth - without consulting the parents - handing babies off to surgeons who just visually examined them and decided which genital qualities looked most prominent, and altered the genitals to look more 'normal'. Then they gave the babies back.  They were wrong. A lot. So when these babies grew up, they'd often be left with genitals they don't identify with, or dysfunctional genitals, or a host of other issues.   Today, because intersex people have campaigned for their rights, doctors no longer perform surgery on babies with ambiguous genitals, unless there's a functional issue. Like, the baby can't urinate or something.  Adults who underwent sex assignment surgery at birth have expressed the trauma they had to experience, and because our society is making progress, many intersex kids today don't identify with a 'traditional' gender. They also don't feel pressured into surgery and more and more people are rejecting the binary idea of gender, and feel like their gender identity exists outside M or F.  And just as intersex people are born without a fixed male or female gender based upon their physical biology, the idea that others are born with their identities in conflict with their non-ambiguous physical biology is obviously valid as well.   There are more than two genders, physical biology cannot dictate psychological identity, and anyone who disagrees with that is either grossly misinformed or is intentionally spreading disinformation to achieve an ulterior motive.  The facts are directly at odds with all the arguments these bigots make. Which is amusing, given that one of the most vocal advocates of the disproven binary birth genders based on sex chromosomes is infamous for his incessant assertion that 'facts don't care about your feelings'.   Well, facts have demolished that entirely false opinion concerning gender and identity. And I don't care how you feel about that either.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Why cant people just live and let live? Getting to actually know one trans person would cure a good portion of transphobes. As for traps who claim trans women cant know what being socialized as a woman is like from birth, do trans people not have mothers, sisters and friends? I would assume that most trans women identified with those people in their lives much more emphatically. We mostly learn from watching those people in girlhood. Also, it's not easy to be socialized Male. Especially when you dont identify as one. Not being able to show emotion. Expected to be strong and tough all the time. I can empathize with both sides because my father wanted a boy and my brother wasn't born until I was 11. So I was simultaneously treated as a boy and told I was never going to be as strong or smart as a man. That I had to stay thin and act dumb if I were to ever find a husband. Individual experiences cant be put into these boxes. Ever. I wanted to add that I remember being about 13yrs old and hearing myself be referred to by female pronouns meant so much to me.

"So I have no idea if anyone will read this or in fact care but this video made me so emotional because I was definitely a TERF for a good minute. I'm not sure if anyone ever called me one and I was maybe less vocal about it but I certainly harbored those beliefs. Nothing really changed until I underwent emergency surgeries to remove my ovaries due to precancerous tumors and no the eggs were not salvageable. I went through an identity crisis because one my hormones were different and some of the characteristics of estrogen loss are very apparent maybe not to everyone but certainly to me and two I was unable to yes ( this sounds dumb even typing this) be the gaia I was meant to be and harbor life although I still have a uterus and can in theory still carry a child I cannot without expensive intervention get the hormones or pregnancy that I had believed made me a woman. So I struggled and masked my pain in a lot of humor and reassurances to my partner that we would save a lot on condoms now and this whole experience shaped my empathy for gender dysphoric people because to me I still don't 100% feel like I should as a woman whether that's because of my pcos symptoms(Google it) or  post surgical menopause and I almost cried when I experienced a period again. But this whole thing boils down to these women mislead themselves into feeling threatened by people who aren't in this situation because they want to be but because that's the hand they were dealt and they are doing the best they can as we all are.

You nailed it, as I knew you would, and I so appreciate you taking these important questions seriously while answering them effectively.

And their argument about gender stereotypes seems pretty invalid because then what about hyper feminine cis women? And am I toxic for being more masculine? Their arguments have lots of holes. And I mean as far as abolishing gender, why would they claim that if they care so much about being women? Yes Karen, you are a woman, somebody wanting to identify as a trans woman does not change that for you. Just like how you don't have to say anything you don't want to say, it will just make you look like an asshole and an idiot when you call a trans woman he or it. My own mother is like that with racism and talking about trans people... 'I'm not racist but...' or (on a friends trans ex girlfriend) 'Well let's just remember he dated an unstable boy, that was the real problem'. A lot of people claim to be all inclusive then use the iconic 'but'. Like how people know I'm bi but I'm either a predator to women or want to fuck an entire football team of guys because like that's totally how it works. And don't think they realize using oppression is also a moot point because I'm pretty sure a straight cis woman has it a lot better than a trans straight woman. I understand abuse could also play a part in how terfs view the world, but it shouldn't excuse being such an asshole. Positive side note though: Love the aesthetics for this video. <3","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm confused by the 'abolish gender' segment. She says she's going to abolish gender, and then appears costumed as if she's about to do Ophelia's mad scene from Hamlet. That's femininity of a particular type, and not genderless. Then she puts her hair under a cap, so that there's no hair to distract from her face. Since her face still appears feminine, this makes her seem more feminine, because it becomes clear that she doesn't need hair to appear feminine. Then she stops using words, and the mind no longer has to process what she's saying and focuses entirely on the image, which again seems more emphatically feminine because it doesn't depend on feminine speech patterns . At each step of the way, removing things that signal femininity without decreasing the impression of femininity makes her seem a bit more feminine as the segment progresses.  I don't know jack about makeup, but it looks to me like she's wearing blush throughout the segment, and there may be some other light makeup. Along with the Ophelia outfit, that would seem to undermine any effort to appear genderless. In addition there's the problem of subcutaneous fat softening the contours of the face and making it more feminine. And finally, even back when she was a cross-dressing man, she was a pretty girl. So take someone who's 'naturally fish', as she puts it, feminize the face with subcutaneous fat, feminize it further with a little makeup, and you don't end up with genderless.  She ends with 'I can't stand this. Fuck this.' What is it she can't stand? There doesn't seem to be an obvious reason for her distress. I'm not criticizing, I just don't understand the choices she made in this segment, or what she was trying to communicate.  Edit: Removed references to Natalie's beauty, because that wasn't what was at issue.  Second edit: I guess this segment is about disphoria? Sorry for being obtuse. To me it's not intuitively obvious that a beautiful woman, demonstrating that neither her beauty nor her femininity depend on the usual props of hair, heavy makeup, feminized clothing, or even female speech behavior, is feeling disphoria. I had to work it out intellectually, and intellect without intuition is pretty slow. Apparently, I don't have any intuitive empathy for trans women's disphoria. The only thing I can say for myself is that I'm sincerely trying to understand.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think I can add some elements to the conversation with my experiences. When it comes to having your life supposedly shaped by male privilege, this can be completed reverted by being 'fem' (as Natalie points out (lol miss Points)). As a gay male having  very easily identifiable male body features, I often find myself experiencing and understood what women go through... Because I wear heels and had lately extra long box braids, it became very common for dicknuggets to express whatever they thought about me outloud in the street. So when I went out wearing a skirt that week, I felt fear: I knew I was drawing the attention of these stupid people and I knew what I would be associated with... So I experienced life as a woman (eventhough these stupid guys weren't likely to sexualy harass me, which makes women case so much scarier) and my understanding of what women go through became visceral, I then realised how impossible it is to figure out what the real tee is when you don't drink it yourself, but how fast you get it tasting the tiniest drop.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Oh one comment I have that isn't necessarily a 'concern' but I've seen a lot of cis women state discomfort with the idea that to be 'not trans' is to be comfortable in one's own body. I myself often feel a lot of discomfort with societal expectations as a lesbian and a woman who doesn't present as butch anymore but still doesn't wear makeup and isn't really good at 'girly things' and as someone who doesn't have a whole lot of love for their own body. It might be useful to reframe it as 'someone who doesn't feel as though they are the gender they were assigned at birth' rather than something to do with comfort e.g. you're 'comfortable' with the gender assigned to you at birth (which I see a lot) and which doesn't totally ring true to me or a lot of other cis women (especially lesbians.) Rather, I don't process this discomfort as a belief that I don't belong to the category of 'woman' but rather acknowledge that this discomfort is part of my lesbian womanhood.   I think too that people having similar feelings and coming to the conclusion that they AREN'T the gender they were assigned at birth feels somehow offensive because they feel that they're being told they can't process the same feelings differently. And, to be fair, sometimes I also feel that way when my nonbinary friends have asked 'are you sure you're not nonbinary?' It's difficult emotional work to be queer and it requires empathy towards the fact that people can come to different conclusions from similar experiences.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Some of the criticism is valid, there is a lot of visceral hate in TERF forums that really is disgusting. But in real life, i've encountered a few very reasonable of gender critical feminists recently, and i'm kinda started agreeing with some of their points. The problem is, that it's very hard to have a discussion about this with trans people when they get offended by the tiniest indication of denyig their gender identity/womanhood/manhood, because they believe that's denying their existence. GCs belive gender identity is essentialism and doesn't exist. (That's not the same as when conservatives say that, because conservatives actually do belive in gender identity, they are just unaware of it and think it's unseparably connected to biological sex and gender expession.) So are gcs offending humanity all the time? The whole point of gender critical feminism is that NOBODY should (eventually) identify as any gender, we should only do it for emancipatory reasons, similalry to the working class. Questioning if  - in class sense - trans women are women is completely reasonable. The video didn't give an answer to that question either.

"The fact that these feminists attack trans people rather than the Kardashians is kinda like how the leftist factions warred with each other during the Spanish Civil War (despite having far bigger Franco fish to fry), and how universal religions denounce those who deviate even slightly from official dogma as being heretics (and tirelessly seek them out and purge them).

"Reminds me of how I responded to a 'gender critical radical feminist''s desire for debate. She said both the stuff about reinforcing stereotypes about womanhood thing and made fun of masculine trans women, and responded to almost all points with 'source pls' and insisting calling women men isn't misgendering, it's just her opinion. So I got a bunch of sources together, pointed out that trans communities challenge stereotypes far more with nonbinary people (whom she had called disgusting), and so forth. She didn't reply. I think she must've realised that I wasn't going to simply say flimsy one-liners OR resort to simply insulting her and decided I wasn't fun anymore. I had begged her to see the similarities in how MRAs and her crew (I specifically avoided saying 'TERF') talk and act about trans people, and she just claimed that MRAs actually like trans people (with no source) which somehow proved we're all really men. At least I got to see how their ideas are just paper cutouts, I suppose. She obviously didn't expect any trans people to actually bother responding to her.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As always, an incredible informative and well-worded Video essay. I respect you as a content creator so much.  I would probably group myself as an angry cis & queer feminist. I have no personal experience with trans people, so my view has no nuance at all. I just say: everybody deserves love and respect. That's about it.   A while ago, I came across a TERF forum and read through a few of the comments. One thing really stuck with me and to this day, I have no idea what to do with it. The thread discussed the topic whether it is alright to exclude trans women from some female spaces simply for not being able to have certain experiences.  The OP described her deep fear of being sexually assaulted and getting pregnant from the experience. She felt like her trans friends and the trans people she talked about it to online tried to silence her on that matter because it is supposedly trans-exclusionary (since trans women usually can't get pregnant). The OP wanted a space that people who are able to have these experience can safely inhabit and felt misunderstood and traumatized by trans women who felt excluded by the topic.   Now of course I can't know whether the OP has ever experienced backlash from trans-people or trans supporters for wanting to discuss topics that usually don't apply to the trans experience. But it really got me thinking. This is also a topic that women who can't have children can't relate to. Is it wrong to create separate safe spaces within female communities because parts of that community don't and will never have any insight on a specific topics? I honestly don't know.   Anyway, sorry for rambling. Great video!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"They targeted gamers.  Gamers.  We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.  We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.  We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.  Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us?

There are few things more satisfying than being entertained and educated at the same time. I found myself nodding along the whole time! I would just say one thing, and I'm sure you know it already. Many cis women can understand what its like to be rejected by society for the way they look, to be looked on as monsters becaue they suit a certain ideal. Fat women for instance, often have to have secret love affairs because the men who fetishize their bodies do not want to be seen in public women. I am sure that many differently abled people across the gender spectrum can relate to this. Ultimately, there is no ultimate victim card that can be pulled. Pain is pain but it is not all the same.

"Terfs are supposed to be the champions  of women presenting as butch or femme as they like, but mock transwomen for qualities that cis-women can have too. Cis-women can be very tall, very muscly, bearded etc and these women are not really accepted by society, and supposedly who terfs are fighting for. They are therefor hypocrites for mocking transwomen for their manly attributes, when they say that they want women of all shapes and sizes to be accepted by society. If I was a bearded cis-woman, then mean comments about a transwoman's stubble would hurt me too.

"Cis-Man here. I've been asking these questions in good faith for years, desperately trying to understand. I think I struggle with black and white thinking generally, and can't hear the simplified catch-phrases without them just sounding Orwellian. 'All women are women! Four legs good, two legs bad!' I struggle to talk to my ftm, mtf, and nb trans friends, because the questions I don't feel like I'm allowed to ask won't stop repeating themselves in my brain long enough to think of something else, anything else to talk about. I want to reduce suffering and promote flourishing, and calling people by the names, pronouns, and genders they request seems like a really low cost way of doing that. It's just when I feel like I have to accept claims that seem metaphysical and make no sense, I can't do it. And it's made me isolate myself more than normal because I'm afraid my only social circles, all of which are very trans-friendly, will find out I don't agree with the dogma and cast me out as a hateful bigot.  I dated a person who is non-binary, and I could never even quite figure out what they meant by it. Like, it was absolutely central to their sense of identity, but the few times I tried to gently probe so I could understand, it just sounded like they were upset that people care about gender in the first place. Which I can respect, but I don't get how that makes *them* not have a gender. And it always felt like they were doing double-think to hold that view while trying to also respect trans-men and women. But I could barely ever talk to them about any of this, because everything I've read told me that I would be invalidating them and causing violence and real harm to them. And I loved them (still do), and didn't want to hurt them. So instead I just kept myself at arms distance, because I also thought it was unfair to them for us to get closer when I so clearly didn't understand something so fundamental about them.  Natalie, I've watched and re-watched every video you've made on these subjects, hoping to come to some answers, and really hoped that this one would do it, but all it's told me is that you don't personally hold views as extreme as every single feminist I know. I don't have issue with any of the things you said (that I can think of, at least), but your nuanced views are so far away from everyone else in the trans community that they're basically worthless for me to understand what everyone else means.

"I'm not seeing any rebuttals in the comments, so here's mine. For one, I don't think TERFs have an issue with trans women being too feminine AND too masculine, at least based on the information presented. It seems like they have a problem with people of obvious male sex (hairy paw, neanderthal in his 50's) attempting to be feminine. In addition, using a desire to be regarded as female by incorporating societal stereotypes of what a woman should be into your persona seems like a cop out to me if you're really against societal constraints on identity. Lastly, I wonder what Natalie thinks constitutes being a woman, cause I didn't find her perspective on that. If it's not being 'feminine', and it isn't being born with XX chromosomes, what is it? A meaningless word, at least in regards to some real structure to the world?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I wasn't dissapointed, as you are always articulate and lovely, but do feel like you haven't approached the topic in very good faith (and if I'm honest I wasn't really expecting you to). You've rightly pointed out that so-called gender crit online has devolved into little more than hubs for bigots to express their...bigotry, but you've failed to acknowledge (or perhaps, minimised) that there are genuine concerns that have caused the core of friction between feminism and transactivism, which has been greatly exacerbated by a failure to engage with each other in good faith on BOTH sides. You highlight the transphobia of Germaine Greer and gender crit reddit, and fail to show one example of the misogyny espoused by any transwoman/man, in the name of transactivism or in general. So you somewhat paint women's concerns, inadvertently or not, as being silly and irrelevant because you personally are reasonable and can sympathise to an extent with the ones you present in this video. And also the fact that, like any social-political movement (including feminism), transactivism absolutely has flaws and does have issues (with individuals and as a movement) with how it relates to and engages with women and other LGB people. Particularly lesbians. I felt like....you almost acknowledge this but stop just short. I understand that this is a fairly personal video where you are simply giving a reasonable and level-headed response to a number of feminist concepts that have been turned into catchphrases by people who have never read a thing about them to throw at anyone who's trans.

This has been said to me after i expressed this of myself in very gender-friendly terms. and to me, when used like that terf is ABSOLUTELY a slur because it's basically 'dyke' veiled in progressivism.  also you never did in fact define womanhood which is why radfems criticize both passing and non passing transwomen. THERE IS NO INTRINSIC FEMALE ESSENCE. GENDER WAS INVENTED TO OPPRESS FEMALES. i wont deny that you face whats probably a mix of misogyny and homophobia but that doesnt mean you have to call what you feel WOMANHOOD because according to gender theory itself womanhood can be anything, is thus completely meaningless and useless as a term.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's funny how males have discovered a new form of peacocking that is highly effective for catching attention of males and females: femininity. Contrapoints is really capitalizing on this trend. That's quite interesting. As an entertainer, I give them props. The costumage alone is almost as neat as the setting and lighting.   Transfeminism is an oxymoron. Transwomen have pioneered something women never could have---a form of phallocentric womanhood, where the penis is now, whether it's removed or not, the center of womanhood, where male reproductive costs are equated with female reproductive costs (because a male IS a female), and where female sexuality suddenly always includes males, often with penises. It's a conflation of the sexes, both form and function, i.e. a female does not come in a male body form, in fact it is the body that is male or female, never both, never metaphysically female while materially male. The body cannot be internally bifurcated on the basis of sex, it is always one or the other. It seems transfeminism is based on the varied social experiences of males who like to look feminine, as Contrapoints at 13:40 or so explains that feminine males like himself are not granted 'male privilege' when, for example, walking down the street. Contrapoints, just remember, you do have the privilege to be a female if you want and all that that legally entails, so... there's that. Maybe there's 'female privilege' which I'm guessing is just the ability to make money off of being sexualized and looked at or physically used for sex (#trans #transgender on Twitter are both filled with transwomen selling feminized sex), more so than any male.  No person is an 'it.' So... that's bizarre. Clocking a trans person is like clocking a fat person.... I mean, you'll see it if they are really fat. Try clocking a 'cis person' instead. Is that easy? Can you clock a pregnant woman? You cannot always tell someone's bodily state by looking at them, but humans are wired to investigate because we are most interested in each other.   If females at any point get confused and believe that they have the same reproductive costs as males, they will be disadvantaged.  (Having to specify male and female when talking about humanity really makes us sound like an animal specie---a primate where males often peacock for attention, heh).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Cool video, and I like your take on gender metaphysics. I'm cis myself, and haven't done a ton of study on the topic, so I'm not exactly super qualified to say, but since I'm allowed my own opinion, I think this is a good counterpoint (sorry) to PhilosophyTube's video on transphobia, which I don't think makes sense. Watching it, I thought that his claim that people must have a robust ontological understanding of trans people as the gender they identify as rather than simply saying, 'I'll treat them how they want to be treated' came off as an excessively cumbersome prerequisite towards anti-transphobia to ask of most people, especially if you actually want to reduce the number of transphobes, and I think your quote from Catherine MacKinnon really spoke to what I felt about that. Of course, you made a lot of the same arguments that Olly did, which is great, because most of them were good, especially pertaining to actually answering people's questions about trans feminist theory. That said, I think that as far as people who aren't really interested in metaphysics are concerned, that take is good. Very educational video, though!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I find it refreshing how you are honestly taking on each of these concerns in a critical way. I feel like this is a place where I can honestly voice my concerns. I like how you come up with good arguments to honest concerns like myself and other cis-gender people have.   The feminist inside of me is one of the major forces that makes it hard for me to believe that someone can truly be transgender. I guess I feel that a lot of transgender people identify with a gender stereotype rather than actually being born into the wrong gender. The feminist inside of me says things like 'Just because a boy plays with dolls or wears dresses, doesn't make that boy a girl' or 'Just because that girl likes tools and trucks doesn't make that girl a boy'. Despite this, if someone asks me to call them by a different name or refer to them by another pronoun, I will do everything in my power to abide by those requests. I may not think that your gender dysphoria is valid/real, but I will do everything in my power to protect that freedom and right for you.

The second option is to erase the concept of gender and say that only what's in your pants ever matters. I love how this video takes a very nuanced look at the messy reality that's in between those false alternatives.

I hardly identify at all with the gender roles, expectations, beauty and grooming standards, etc. etc. assigned to me by having been born female.

Racists are not excused if they once had a negative experience with a black person, nor should misandrists be for the same reasons.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The whole assumption makes no sense once you stop assuming all trans men are straight. Speaking of which, I hope one day you do a video on the hellfire that is the trans masculine community, because the level of in-fighting, dysphoria and gender expression policing, and emulation of the ideologies of the 'anti-sjw's' who once plagued the internet to humiliate the most outwardly queer of us, internalizing those ideas and learning to hate their fellow trans people in the name of respectability politics, leaving those on the fringes helpless. They don't even realize they're harming their own community in this 'purge' of 'trans-trenders' because this obsession with getting rid of people who are 'not really trans' leads to thousands and thousands of even slightly feminine or androgynous trans men who don't have the energy to always hate their bodies agonize over their own legitimacy. That kind of self torture is not what you want in a community of such vulnerable people in society. Anyway I think it's an interesting topic that really needs talking about by someone who is able to go in as a more level headed neutral party, looking in on the community as a whole rather than being part of one group talking shit about another from within the community. idk","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I doubt ContraPoints will read this, but here goes nothing.  Let me start off by saying that I agree with pretty much everything you said in this video, and now go off on a really wonky tangent.  I have a step-sister who is half-Filipino, half-mixed white European descent, who is going around saying she is a Native American... I told her that I thought it was offensive to appropriate the racial identity of a group that she has no connection with whatsoever and she cut contact with me.  Anyway, I had the accusation leveled at me that I shouldn't support transgenderism if I don't support trans-racialism (although she's not even claiming trans-racialism; she's outright pretending that she's always been Native American to the point of pretending her parents... aren't her parents).  While I have my own thoughts on why this is ludicrous, I'd be curious to hear what you or others reading this think of the subject of trans-racialism in general.  I think if nothing else it could make for an entertaining video, lol. . One of the things that I find strange about this particular situation with my step-sister is that unlike, say, white women using blackface as we've repeatedly seen in the news (and accusations from detractors that this is solely done by white women and is therefore obviously a byproduct of white privilege), my step-sister is half-Filipino.  It's part of the reason why she's easily able to convince idiots that she's a Native American.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Hey! I loved the video but there was one thing that I thought you got wrong- with transmedicalisim, the beliefs system is that it's A.) Necessary that transgenderisim remains medicalized for things like being able to use insurance to have stuff like surgeries at least partially paid for and B.) That it's necessary to have gender dysphoria [As in having a disconnect between your gender and sex.]. Now of course, there's a lot of toxicity within the community, and I'm sure there are people who are exactly as you described, but either or, how it was presented in the video wasn't fully accurate, or at least from how I see it.

I didn't want to argue it further. I'm a cis-gender male, but I understand and empathize with people. It can be frustrating trying to have a conversation about these topics, because so many people think transgender people are just 'making it up' or overdoing it somehow and fantasize about a utopia that doesn't exist.

That is to say, they claim to be gender critical, but would shame even cis men who express in feminine ways. Not because 'femininity is bad' but because they see it as sacred.  Gender critical, even going so far as to claim they don't believe that there are male and female brains, and yet males are somehow *innately* rapey, regardless of socialisation.

"This was very interesting but IMO it doesn't really address the worries of 'normies'. I'ts Trans vs Turfs vs a whole group of academics who are all the same; most of the rest of us don't have these concerns...    For me the issues never addressed are much more practical (where it spills over into real life).   Is sex with a trans women who passes actually rape and where do you draw a line with informed consent?    Do trans woman have an unfair physical advantage against XX women?  (Fallon Fox was a low level MMA fighter as a man who's career spiked after she changed). I remember watching her break a females Skull (before she was outed), I remember thinking they didn't belong in the same cage! With hindsight it looked like a man beating a woman. I don't know 'Gender Critical issues' but I do know a little about MMA and it was unfair; in a world where men can fight women you will lose all your female stars (a great female fighter is often beaten by a good male fighter). And again where do you draw the line with consent?      In the UK we put a trans woman in a female prison and she raped other inmates, don't you worry that allowing men who wear dresses to use female facilities will in courage some of the worst people to align themselves with you? Again in the UK the 'pro-paedophile' Groups are fighting for inclusion within the LGBT community.    I think Feminists et al all live in thought bubble, for the longest time Germain Greer tactics were accepted because they were used against SWM now she has turned them against members of the LGBT, you live buy the sword!   Personally I think the first side (Trans or Turf) to come up with honest answers and practical solutions will win the normal's but honestly sometimes it feels like LGBT is much more academic and doesn't care to win anyone outside their circle?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It's the kind of rhetorical device I EXPECT to see from the people who don't support nonbinary identities-- well what, are you a robot then? gender is an essential part of the human experience! you can't NOT have a gender! you're just broken-- and although I think I understand why it was used here... I don't know. It wasn't uncomfortable in an 'I should examine my thoughts on this!' way. It was uncomfortable in a 'wow I think that actually hurts' way.  Fuck TERFs, though, obviously.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This video ignores the central tenet of the gender critical position, which is that sex is immutable, so no matter how much gender-bending you do a man can never become a woman.   This is quite important when you're saying that trans women rapists shouldn't be locked up with female prisoners, or that trans women MMF fighters shouldn't be allowed to beat the shit out of female opponents, for example.   This was never discussed because the material reality of it is just incompatible with the metaphorical gender feelings and adamant thinking that support the trans position. It's impossible to reconcile the two, so here we are.   The rest of the video is just squabbling over the most unedifying behaviour that you find in every corner of the internet. The fact that a lot of rad fems can be unnecessarily rude sometimes doesn't mean the whole gender critical position is worthless. You wouldn't want the legitimacy of all trans people to rest on the behaviour of the most violent and unhinged of your lot.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I wish you would have gone one step further in your analysis: I 100% agree that the petty cruelty has its origins in disgust, but the question is where do you go from there? Are we just supposed to somehow rewire people so that they no longer feel the visceral gut wrenches they do at seeing Ms Yellowhair? You're right to project the same feelings onto more mundane homophobia, but how are you supposed to get someone who perpetually associates homosexuality with anal sex and feces to not want to vomit? As much as you can work to change the culture, it seems to me that there are a large number of people who will simply never be comfortable on a primal level with some or all forms of queerness.    Let me put it this way - I know worldly, educated, sexually experienced people who are still nauseated by the notion of straight oral sex. They can suppress their disgust all they want, but they still will actively avoid the topic in conversation and prefer to be kept in the dark about it. I don't think you have to do much imagining about their feelings on more heterodox forms of sexuality. While these people are not in the cultural mainstream, the disgust mechanism carries over in the same way. How would you expect them to feel about the normal public goings-on at any major Pride parade? There's obviously a difference between the feeling of disgust and the bullshit that is imposed on queer people legally/physically/financially, but it seems like an inescapable situation for anyone that LiVeS iN a SoCiEtY that being a source of physical disgust to others is not conducive to everyone having a good time.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Dead ass serious question drinking buddy, (and I want a response from you ContraPoints if you see this), are you a wine person? Cause I can't stand most wines to save my life, and that may strain our one-sided perpetual binge.  Also, what exactly are 'women's issues'? I took two classes for my major that at least touched on feminism, one of them about feminism in politics.   When we talked about increasing women's representation, gender quotas, legislating for women's issues etc. a big question was, aside from being half the country and it's fair (which rarely works historically) was why?   Do you think that more women in politics would fundamentally take the political process and parties in a less corrupt, more cooperative and humane direction, as was the argument of many Suffragettes back in the day once they realized appealing to the idea of it being inherently right and fair wouldn't suffice? Which many modern scholars point towards as still being 'ahhh sorta valid' due to social conditioning of women and girls? Or would they just end up being crooked and ruthless like most everyone else?   What are women's issues? I typically got answers about healthcare, childcare, reproductive rights (generally pro-choice), assault and harassment, etc. Things that tend to play into stereotypes of what women 'should' consider important. As a man, I have shit healthcare so that's an important issue to me. I really want to have kids, so parental leave (and it's almost always framed as maternity leave....like I don't deserve to see my child or some shit), daycare etc. are also important issues. I've had men and women say and do things that have made me genuinely uncomfortable. So what makes these things 'women's issues' specifically?   Should we really frame them as such, since there are probably a lot of men who could actually relate and see these things as important too?   Just wanted your opinion Contra.

"I like this video, and yeah I watched it to the credits. You're taking an interesting approach to this that I haven't seen or heard many trans people do. And I really appreciate that! And not to kiss your ass but only because you brought it up: you do look really good. I'm kind of newly radfem since just a few months or so, while still having half a foot in the trans community, hence why I'm here. I'm fine with the term 'terf' (and I agree it's not a slur, unless it's said to lesbians for the reason they're lesbians, then it's pretty much a homophobic slur, or used as one) although I think it's silly and incorrect, which is why I'll mostly be using radfem instead here. I like to jokingly call myself a terf, though. This is gonna get long, but I tried to keep it short... in vain.  My background is I used to be mostly transmedicalist but not very strictly so at all. I was fine with nb and didn't have a huge problem with non-dysphoric trans people. I still acknowledge that some trans people don't have dysphoria while some cis people do, cause it's not so black and white. I was part of the trans community for a solid decade as I was transitioning ftm cause I truly believed with my entire essense that I was a trans man since my teens. I also thought I was bisexual.  So then wtf happened and how did I turn terfy? I detransitioned, and on that way it was. Basically I started questioning gender because when my dysphoria disappeared I no longer felt I had any internal sense of gender, but for the first time ever saw myself as fully a woman, and loving it. I needed answers, and radfem had them. About 6 months later I realised I'm only attracted to other afab people, regardless of their genders. You know, like a terfy lesbian who doesn't like dick but could maybe get down with a trans guy, but is primarily into cis women. That didn't exactly fit the 'attraction goes to gender, not sex' view I had previously believed. Again, I was confused. And again, radfem had the answers. And an amazing lesbian community that surely got me hooked.   Shortly after that I considered myself no longer adhering to the trans community's views and joined radfem. *But* I still respect and care about trans people.  Because I still remember what it was like to have gender dysphoria and feeling like I really was a man in my past. And because I also remember what other trans people have told me about their experiences back then. I know that femininity and masculinity is not what makes trans people think they're trans, because I was a gnc trans man. And I know exactly what it feels like to 'feel' that you're of a gender different from your sex and willing to defend it to your death.  But I'm still not quite on your side of the argument just because I have a deeper understanding of it than most cis women and can regurgitate my former beliefs well. The way I see it...  is that at the core it's dysphoria that makes trans people think they should be of the opposite sex. And that's pretty much it. It's a belief that comes from that suffering or disagreement with your own body. However, I can also believe that trans people are the only ones who do have an internal sense of gender, cause it seems cis people typically don't. But regardless of who has it or what, to me it's just a belief, like believing god is real. I don't believe gender is real, although I absolutely understand that's what other people truly believe, and I respect that those who do, simply do.  Personally I've no issues with anyone transitioning (including non-dysphoric people), using the pronouns people want, and just being a decent human being about it, ya know. And actually I know that it's really only a loud but small minority of trans women who act like predatory creeps towards lesbians and women in general. Some actually do act like that, and it's the stuff of nightmares for me, but I don't think most trans women are like that at all. On that point, as with much else, I take an individual approach.   But I'm really not grossed out by most trans women. A lot of them are really beautiful, including non-passing ones. But even if not, so what. Beauty isn't everything. But I think that I see beauty in them a lot because I see myself in them. Not that I am, but I resemble. And to me seeing a badly covered stubble on the face of a very beautiful person who looks like a woman otherwise, or a deep voice, or receeding hairline, etc, is comforting. I usually can't see myself in other cis women anymore.  Also even I don't like the company of transphobic radfems (we call them 'rudefems' btw) and I specifically can't stand those who call trans people's medical transitions 'mutilations' cause well... that applies to me too, cause I was on testosterone and had top surgery, and I don't like being called mutilated for that!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The idea that you can preclude anyone from being a woman because they haven't had 'the universal female experience' is so fucking ridiculous anyway. There are all kinds of experiences that women have and some that a LOT of women have, and those experiences can be taken seriously and looked at deeply without converting them into a gatekeeping method. The fact that lots of women have been sexually harassed at a young age is a Big Deal, but there's a big leap from there to imagining that it's a Requirement for being a 'legitimate woman.' Girlhood isn't a monolithic experience. Even if we were just talking about Cis girlhood, THAT isn't a monolithic experience. Girlhoods are radically different - often directly opposite to each other in the very features we are told are definitive - depending on a lot of other circumstances; wealth, ethnicity, nationality, citizenship, gender conformity, ability, and - yes - cis-status.  Some women, like Natalie, didn't have girlhoods because they were not, by their own self knowledge, girls when they were children.  ...But some women did have girlhoods which were made a particular flavour of difficult by all the people calling them boys. That isn't NOT a girlhood just because it doesn't look like a cis-girl's girlhood. Just like how a lot of those same TERFs' descriptions of universal girlhood include things like 'not being allowed to get your dress dirty, being kept inside to play with dolls while your brother gets to play outside in the forest, being raised to be pretty and helpless and dependent and decorative' which is actually a VERY SPECIFIC niche of middle class white girlhood and has no relatability for, say, sweatshop girls.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Mmm.  I wish this was a more nuanced video because I am someone who is gender critical but I am not one to be nasty to other people ; there is no need to, plus it's rude.  I do not feel disgust or view transwomen/men  as less than. I just think the concept of gender as we know it is horse poop, which puts me in a pickle when it comes to the logic of trans-identities.  I am disappointed as I have heard some good things about ContraPoints, but (this being my first time watching ContraPoints) what I got was seemingly dismissive, mocking, patronizing, and funny commentary.  It seemed like the responses were delivered in the same tone and manner as what was being criticized.  I appreciate the cascade of funny,  but most of it seemed to be cloaked  in condescension.  This was supposed to be towards those who are genuinely curious,  right? Eh, maybe some other time.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

A world where feminine and masculine fluidity is seen as normal.   and maybe in such a world there is less of a need to transition. Maybe it's as you say  a 'post modern Utopia'. But if we were in a world where people are free to live how they want without fear of judgement or alienation would that lessen the pressure of fitting into that box.

"I wonder if you'd apply this logic to trans-culturalism and people who dress like they're black and tan themselves darker and claim they identify with the black community. It seems kind of asinine to make this argument unless you support the caricature of gender or culture.   The trans community can do whatever they want to do. I believe they should be allowed in all non-competitive OR non-prison spaces. But to pretend like, 'Oh honey, we're in this together,' when you choose to try to be a woman is kind of ridiculous. A lot of women just want to exist without having to conform to gender stereotypes. I agree that referring to trans-women as 'it' or claiming they have it easy is stupid as hell. Or excluding them from spaces where gender segregation isn't vital. But you are a MRA if you think for a second that you choosing to wear makeup or 'act like a girl' gives you the same experience as being born into a sex that is treated like a second class citizen. It's just silly.   And yes I watched the whole video. I enjoy your content and I think a lot of your points are strong- but dismissing gender stereotypes being displayed by a man to appear like a woman as not being a legit argument is nonsense. It would be no different for me to talk, dress, and look stereotypically black, claim I'm black, and not have any of the upbringing to even justify that behavior. It's just stereotyping when you weren't born with that culture.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I agree with most of this video except the point of TERF not being a slur. I personally think it's definitely used that way towards women who aren't even feminists, or afab lesbians who aren't sexually attracted to transwomen. Just look at how Ariana Grande was dogpiled for that one music video she made and how a bunch of people started calling her a terf because of all the vagina imagery. I also think gender critical women DO go after any woman who they see is 'enforcing the gender binary', especially when it comes to the modeling industry, or the sex work industry. Overall, it was a good video, but I do think in order to have a healthy discussion about sensitive topics, we should try to not only represent both sides as fairly as possible, but also the people who also don't really fall into any particular side but are still affected by these topics to an extent.   Also, try not to worry so much about the socialization aspect, Natalie. Even women are socialized differently according to the individual. I honestly can't say I've ever been catcalled as a 9-year old either.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"The Germaine Greer quote of her cruel treatment of a transwoman fan who found value and inspiration in her work really struck me.  Imagine being in the fan's shoes - meeting this feminist thinker whose work had inspired and moved you deeply - only to be completely crushed when you read THAT later and realize she was talking about YOU. Then watching as Greer went on to make a major agenda of constantly barraging people like you with hate.  Imagine how utterly soul-crushing that would be.   It's also worth noting that Germaine Greer has some VERY dodgy rapist-enabling & colonialist--dogwhistle-racist opinions about rape.  TERFism and soft normalization of white male rapists (while of course demonizing nonwhite males as inherent rapists) are major pillars of the brand of exclusionary 2nd wave 'white feminism' that people like Greer spew that reinforces the rape culture, racism, and queerphobia of white supremacism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I feel this whole conversation is completely meaningless because there's absolutely no consequences here - nobody can stop you living as a woman just like you can't stop anyone from thinking that you're _not_ a woman, especially not when nearly all the arguments on both sides boil down to 'I feel a certain way therefore that's how it should be'. Nobody on either side is giving any statistics or studies, it's all just academic theory that's been bastardized toward whatever angle they're pitching. It's your word against theirs in the courtroom of who-gives-a-fuck.  This is the problem with every damn ContraPoints video: everybody talks about how great these are but this person doesn't actually _say anything_ most of the time. There's a great flow of ideas and a lot of big words and fancy concepts being bandied about but no actually substance to any of it and nothing ever truly gets proven or resolved in any way. It's the equivalent of philosophically arguing why God made certain atoms are lighter than others - _who gives a steaming shit_ ?

"I am tired and a little drunk, and gender politics fascinate me. Prepare yourself for a long ass comment. I apologise for nothing.   Gender is a mixture of hormones, chromosomes, and the psychological need to feel as though we have a role in society. Humans are social creatures and we need to find a way to connect to other people while still retaining our sense of individuality and feeling important to our social group. So we gravitate towards people who have similar interests to us and we allow those people to influence how we think and what we do- we are socially conditioned by them. THIS DOESNT HAVE TO BE A BAD THING! Some social conditioning is good. 'Don't steal' for example, or 'be polite to others'. Social conditioning becomes a problem when we start to punish those who do not conform whilst holding our standard of conformity to an impossible standard that may be out with the person's control. For example our standard of womanhood might be described as 'be feminine, be more emotional and empathetic, have a vagina'. The reason this is problematic is that a) not everyone will agree on these standards and will try to argue or use shame to get others to conform to their particular set of standards, causing inter group fightung and b) some of these standards are completely out with a person's control (For example being born with a vagina) so they are immediately excluded through no fault of their own (which is bullshit!)  In order to solve these problems we need to 1) ask ourselves what our standards for womanhood actually are 2) ask ourselves if any of these standards are unrealistic or out with an individual's control and 3) bear in mind that different people may have different standards of womanhood to us and be willing to acknowledge that   I'm a (cis) woman and I like make up and boys and fluffy animals and knitting and dresses. Being a woman is a really important part of how I see myself in the world and in relation to my friends and family. I'm also a feminist and I'm happy to embrace the fact that other people see womanhood differently and have had it weaponised against them. And that sucks for them- but does that therefore mean I should give up my own experience of womanhood, which for me has been formative and generally positive? If the answer to that is no, then logically you must therefore come to the conclusion that nor should trans women. And if the answer is yes- then you are imposing your standards for womanhood on me. how would you feel if I did that to you? If I told you that just because I find contentment and empowerment in my femininity, that all females should embrace their femininity in the same way or they aren't really women?  In conclusion being a woman means different things to different people and it should! And Its totally ok to find people who have things in common with us and agree with the way we understand social situations, but it's not ok to impose impossible standards on others.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm in medical school, and I work at a hospital that has a very sick cohort of patients. I often see patients in heart, lung, liver, and kidney failure. I have seen patients deteriorate and die. The same 'lizard brain' that compels people to hate and disgust, has the potential to compel people to deep compassion. When a patient is suffering and dying, I believe that most people are more than happy to bring them any bit of comfort. Earlier this year, a patient came out to me as transgender. When I told the rest of the team, all of them had no problem making this sick person feel a little more human and cared for. My hope is that there is some way of scaling this kind of learned love.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Why is something or someone being disgusting not a valid reason to dislike it or them? I understand that your criticism of TERFs comes down to them hiding their true feelings about trans people behind a radical feminist smokescreen, so that's fine, but I think there's a discussion to be had beyond that. I already knew TERFs are disgusted by trans people. When you read their content, you instinctively understand that.

"In terms of not using gendered medical terminology: the other reason that it benefits CIS WOMEN as well as trans men and women to say 'people who mentrate' or 'pregnant people' or 'people with vaginas' when talking about something specific to those things, is it also recognizes the cis women who don't have periods/have had a hysterectomy/don't have a vagnia . These people exist and to imply that ALL women can get pregnant implies that women who can't (who are no doubt struggling with this reality already) are somehow less of a woman. I love the gender neutral medical terms becasue they're SPECIFIC only to the people that the issue concerns. Like 'people with cervixes should get a pap smear every 3 years' makes it clear that if you've had a hysterectomy or don't have a cervix that you don't need to get pap smears. This may be obvious to some but many teens don't know what a pap smear even is. It's just clearer and more informative than 'all women should get pap smears to be healthy'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I know there is like an 'average' cis woman socialization and there are things that most cis women experience, but looking just a little close there are just huge differences as well. Sometimes I can't identify with aspects of the average cis woman early upbringing and socialization, my parents had good paying jobs and wanted me to grow up as a leader, they got me legos and science kits, they always encouraged me to be loud and proud, to participate and take leadership in class. Of course I also experienced parts of the 'girl upbringing' but the thing is that there are many aspects that may change between early socialization of cis women from different backgrounds.  A rich woman will have a very different experience than a poor woman, the country and culture, racism , everything plays a role. Recognizing this differences is extremely important  and that isn't what separates us, it is important to acknowledge some women had different, sometimes even way way tougher, upbringings and that doesn't invalidate anyone's womanhood, prejudice separates our fight. Here in Brazil, one of the countries that kill LGBT people the most, a lot of poor trans girls, when they are feminine presenting from an early age, get kicked out of home and driven to sex work when they are as little as 12 years old. More than 90 percent of trans women here are sex workers due to lack of opportunity, prejudice and being abandoned at a young age, if that isn't absurdly opposite to a cis guy's social upbringing and reality I don't know what is.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Being MtF or FtM has always made sense to me, but when ze/zim/zer and non binary genders came about online in 2014 (or thereabouts. Memory is not infallible.), I couldn't figure it out. Often I have heard from individuals the great deal of pain that came in their lives; people who are vengeful and bitter. That is not to say I haven't seen any that don't speak from pain; I have seen a fair few. But what makes sense to me is to pick one or the other biologic sex/gender--- and then just not give a fuck about gender stereotypes! Present as you wish but keep regular terms and pronouns, and then live without having to create plenty of new terms. Even changing them on the daily if one should wish but the creating of new terms--- especially when out of spite--- seems to just make more pain in this world.

"I love your content it is gripping, irreverent and just loveable.   I'm not familiar with TERF thinking and deeply want everyone to live their personhood and identify to the fullest.   I can acknowledge my privilege as being cis in many ways. However,  I would be lying if I said my gender identity was easy.   For much of childhood and adolescence I daydreamed not about being a boy, but of getting to live the life of one. And yeah maybe back in the Lilith Fair days you  could call me butch. It happened and it did ruin my day.   It was just easier to PREFORM the gender I was born into. And by college I was wearing fit and flare dresses and heels to class.   In grad school and in the job world it's a tight rope of performance. Dress like a woman. Wear makeup or G-d forbid someone will think I have the flu. But then lower my voice to be taken seriously, learn to talk sports and maybe try golf. Basically try to be more if a dude sometimes...super fun game show it isn't.  These are small aggressions compared to actual harassment and assault (yes both happened).   Yet, the reason I bring this all up is to say even though I'm Cis. I still have to think and act on gender ideals set not by myself and I despise a system that puts us all into these tiny boxes.   I feel like sometimes (not always!) Prillviage is a trade off.   I can't even begin to imagine the feeling of being born into the wrong body or the dating issues or safety risks my trans sisters go through.   And, yet if tomorrow I woke up passable as a man it would be liberating in so many ways. From the outside it can look as though trans women have been willing to trade some external prillviage they might have gotten as passable men. (Perhaps not unlike racial passing ....a historical issue I know little about, but perhaps there are parallels).  In an age where reproductive rights are under attack and a known pussy grabber is in the Oval...perhaps TERFS are fustrated and wrongly coming to the conclusion that this is all a zero sum game.   This isn't an argument. Just a moment to reach out and share and throw out the arms of solidarity to ALL my sisters.

"i really like you natalie, and i find you a wholesome activist, artist, thinker, etc.i am gender critical, i think that this vid was partially great, and that's because this issue gets in your nerves, i think you missed some points or you purposely caricaturized them yes, there is mockery and cruelty amongst women and MEN who describe transpeople that way, and yes also hate, that is transphobia, but not all gender critical people refers on those terms to trans people, its not hate what fuels me, for example, i don't feel you as a  woman, and of course, not all women have the same shared experience, but we do have a thing in common, all of us, rich, poor, pick a color, old, young etc. we are thought by men, conceptualized by the patriarchy as property, we are for men, to reproduce men, to enrich men, you name it, and that happens when our sex is observed at birth. in my country it is custom to pierce girls ears, that happened to me because i was born a girl. simply put, there are experiences that we all women share that makes us feel each other in a certain way, we sort of sense each other, we are relieved if there is a women in a place that you may consider dangerous or sketchy, and guess why is that, because of men of course, we band together for a sense os safetyness, and that feeling may not occur with a transwoman next to me the phrase trans women are women is a bit violent, it's something that you know it's not true, you may be happening as a woman now, and as you said, you weren't one in 20 years, that period of time in your life does not simply vanish as you say you are a woman, you obviously know this. i understand that this sort of reaffirmation helps  transwomen to cope with the hundreds of agressions that they face everyday, but you have to understand that it does rub in an obnoxios, almost entitled way, and it has material consequences, eg, sports, that's an issue where wellknown female sport players have raised some valid points that have been completely shutdown by transactivists, check martina navratilova i think you might try to give more time to your inner GC i look forward for your vids, love you natalie","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"What a profound disappointment Germaine Greer has turned out to be. I (a cis woman) idolized her when I was in my early 20s (this would have been mid-late 90's). There's a Sinead O'Connor album that opens with the quote 'I do think that women could make politics irrelevant ... [by fostering] subtle forms of interrelation that do not follow some hierarchical pattern which is fundamentally patriarchal. The opposite to patriarchy is not matriarchy but fraternity, yet I think it's women who are going to have to break this spiral of power and find the trick of cooperation.' That quote resonated so strongly with me and my social/political view at the time. It still does.   When I heard a few years ago that she was a TERF, I had been out of the loop for a while, and I was shocked. I was sure she had to have a good reason, or at least a well-articulated sense of the subject? So I looked up her more recent writings and speech transcripts and was really sad to see that, no: her reason was that she wanted to exercise her right to be a complete asshole about the subject of transgenderism and transwomen especially. She's HORRIBLE. I'm embarrassed that I fell so hard for her. She should show some integrity and do some of that 'difficult emotional work' that she needs to do.   Transwomen are my sisters, teachers, and friends. I really appreciate this video.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is a very well put-together video! I enjoyed watching it beginning to end. A couple things to say:  I've noticed it's nearly always trans women that get the brunt of the harassment. Bathroom issues, safe space issues, sports issues, etc. Trans men are usually considered dumb / lost / pressured lesbians or tomboys, meanwhile I've seen trans women get 20x more harassment and everything else. 'Trans women are stealing what it means to be women, they're perverts trying to rape women, etc.' That kind of thing. I think I know why that is, it's just something i've noticed from personal experiences. Speaking of which...  As a trans-man myself, I've had scrapes with these kinds of 'gender critical' people before that make me wonder how people like them can even exist. I once had someone argue that I was a 'lost lesbian who is being told  to be a man to seem normal,' and that I should 'embrace my inner dyke and start dating a real woman.' I felt disgusted and ashamed of myself in that moment, since being called a lesbian / woman is one of my biggest fears and taking top spot along with someone finding out I'm trans and doing something to me.   Gender critical people have concerns, yes, but they're so dumb that they...really shouldn't exist in the first place. Just the idea that any trans person is lost or creepy or disgusting for us being trans.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The thing is, the idea that all or most trans men experience what it's like to 'grow up female' is certainly not uncontested in the trans community. I myself am a trans man who considers himself to have very rarely if ever meaningfully 'experienced' misogyny (inasmuch as growing up in a patriarchal society at all regardless of position in the hierarchy doesn't count as experiencing misogyny). I grew up in a household that had very few gendered expectations for me, was never bullied or abused or sexually targeted (for gendered reasons or otherwise), and internalized gendered messages from society that were more directed at men (ex. I was an edgy 4chan misogynist when I was like 12-13 and it basically never occurred to me that I was technically a 'girl' too). I came out at 15 and started hormones at 18 and have never/will never experience adult womanhood firsthand.  For a while, my own experiences kinda put me in the 'trans men's gendered socialization is much more similar to cis men's than cis women's and the ones who say otherwise are just trying to deny their own privilege' camp. Now, though, I realize that, like you, my experience was tempered by my whiteness, class privilege, etc. much more than it was ever really about my casab. Trans men who are more marginalized than me along other axes (and/or whose families and environments happened to be more sexist) usually also experience significantly more gendered trauma because all systems of oppression are closely intertwined. I'm glad you're starting to touch on how other trans women's lifelong gendered experiences, especially for women who don't have some of the other privileges that you have, can also be very different from your own and that it isn't casab that determines how your childhood gendered socialization affected you.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"In the end, measuring worth of gender by who has the worse trauma is one of the things that disturbs me most. Why does being a woman require suffering, abuse, and oppression? Why can't people just be glad that a woman (ANY kind of woman), is able to live a happy life? Misery loves company I guess. All this does is normalize abuse, tbh.  America's Next Top Victim indeed.   I think anyone who wants to look plain and live simply should be able to do so. And anyone who wants to look fab and live a loud life, should be. I know it delves into the whole utopia issue... But why can't everyone just enjoy being beautiful in whatever way it means for them, whatever form it takes? It just makes me sad. :(","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i'm a gendercrit lesbian, because the material conditions of female/afab people in and outside of the western world just doesn't add up with any other worldview i could espouse. i also have endless sympathy for trans people and have distanced myself from other radfems/gender critical people in the past for being completely deplorable. i feel that some parts of gender critical thinking were misrepresented (as they usually are) (i.e. how most of us are lesbians and women of color), but i genuinely appreciate and understand, empathize with, and agree with what was said here!! obviously some gender critical women are committed to being as transphobic as possible under the guise of feminism, and obviously some trans women refuse to accept anything that cis women say about our lives/bodies/experiences (or are...downright misogynists), but there's a lot to be learned from every voice and solidarity goes a long way. don't be afraid to ask questions or just not agree with every single part of something, it's all a learning process and discovering what *you* believe is most important!!

"5:37.  This question is actually one I ask when it comes to trans.  It is not hatred...it is what I live.  I do not identify as a woman, but I do prefer things normally assigned to women.  Note that word 'assigned'.  I was told when growing up how boys behaved, how they dressed, and what they did not do.  All children are pushed this sort of thing.  I was told when I wanted to wear a skirt opposed to pants that boys didn't wear skirts.  When I stated I did not want a hair cut I was told that boys did not have long hair....and while being told these things I was seeing girls wearing pants, and having short hair.  To me the issue is not that I 'feel like' a woman...but that the rules foisted on myself, and likely others are the problem.  The concept that gender is a social construct is an accurate one to me.  Or more correctly, Gender stereotypes are socially constructed.  They are also harmful for many.  Many of those mannerisms Contra does would be considered inappropriate for a male to do...unless that male was doing drag......but why?  What makes things 'masculine' or 'feminine'.  Why is it a boy is shunned for liking 'girly' things?  What pisses me off is when people seem to know what my sexual orientation is based soley on my clothing.  Another is judging my mental stability based on my wearing a skirt, hose and heels.  This is not helped by most every time a child (usually a boy) shows up to school in clothing or styles not fitting the stereotype of 'male' is now considered to be Trans.  NO!!!  He may just be a boy that was like myself that saw even at a young age what non-sense it was that boys could not do things that girls could do (and later learning what nonsense it was that girls could not do things boys could).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I'm a gender critical feminist, but I don't frequent the GC subreddit. I don't like it, I find it too extreme. Try the debate sub instead - r/GCdebatesQT if there's any genuineness to your open-mindedness. Plus, let's be honest, TERF doesn't actually mean anything, since it gets lobbed at basically anyone who doesn't agree with the most extreme opinions held by (some) trans activists (and their allies). It gets lobbed at men, women, radical feminists, non-radical feminists, folks on the Right, folks on the Left, and guess who else... yes, that's right, other trans people who hold different opinions about their experiences.

"If having having a traumatic experience with men is enough to justify hatred then how is that any different than someone having a similar reaction after a traumatic experience with another race, Liam Neeson for instance. In fact I'd say there are many people who've had bad experiences with other races, consistently, or significantly enough that they use it as a justification for their fear, hatred, dislike, disgust, etc. of any other member of that group. That doesn't mean their views are accurate, everyone's experience is individual so what may be 'true' for someone might not be true to the next. These are the same people often referred to as bigots because 'there is no excuse.' Playing by your (proverbially) game, that means that no bigotry of any kind is excusable, but maybe all of it is. There is always a reason WHY someone is a racist. They don't just wake up and choose to be. It can be from ignorance passed on by their elders or other role models or T.V. or the internet or a host of bad experiences or a combination of the two. If you can afford to give man-hating women a voice you should be able to give black-hating whites one too, if you are operating under an actual principle and not just bias.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"There are distinct differences between the brain of a male and a female (like penis and vaginas 8:10). Research has been published that men have larger amygdalas and woman have larger hippocampuss. The physical differences also manifest in many ways such as how drugs affect the body and basic differences between males and females such as stress responses and neuro chemical reactions (Cahill 2006). I am for inclusion of all regardless of the decisions they decide to make, but gender reassignment seems like a brash and crude answer to gender disphoria. It is obvious that if one wants to be identified in their daily life as male, female, or transitioning, that can be done with a fair amount of work (cosmetic and psychological). I wonder what the physical augmentation of the sex organs gives to the receiver besides a placebo? I do not have much experience with gender disphoria, but I know it is controversially classified in the DSM-5. I can't imagine a physical change of the genitala can combat the root of the disphoria. I would also like to say that I do not support the disparaging of people who are trans, and communities that do that are problematic regardless of their ideology viewpoints.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Queen! Being judged as unworthy by femenists is something a lot of cis women deal with too.  Their rejection pushed me down the  anti-feminist rabbit hole for several years until I realized that the real problem wasn't feminism in itself, the idea was basically good but some femenists have bad execution. To me femenism is supporting the right of all women to live as they choose without experiencing oppression or violence. That's the goal right? But some femenists want to dictate what that life *should* look like. No stay at home moms. No sex workers. No plastic surgery. Don't be too conventionally pretty. Don't be a Christian. Don't play mainstream videogames. Don't wear dresses. Go work in STEM, even if you don't enjoy it, we need numbers damnit. Don't be a nurse or a teacher. Don't ask questions. Fall in line. If you disagree with me it's just your internalized misogyny talking, you poor thing. Etcetera. I'm sorry that trans women have to deal with that, may it serve as a small comfort that being badgered and bullied by a bitchy subset of femenism is definitely part of the female experience.

"Natalie, I've got a question: Why are you portraying a world without gender like a white and empty space? That's bullshit. You would still look exactly the same without gender roles. The only thing that differs is that your cloths, your makeup, your hair, your voice etc. wouldn't be associated with gender anymore. Nobody would dare to call you a man because nobody would care. Every person could wear what it wants without refering to itself as a man or a woman. The world would be exactly as colorfull and diverse as before.  To me it seems like you fetishize your concept of 'femininity'. You want to be called a woman because you love this gender role. Otherwise you'd just give a shit and define yourself as a person. This radical gender identity is enforcing the existing categories because you still have to decide between being 'male' and being 'female' (or any other kind of gender).

"Glad to see that Winona Ryder has her own platform. I like when anyone goes to the effort of making a film and making a point about anything they may believe is a worthy subject.  Many of the world has no idea about variation by choice or by hormonal genetics/ or the combo. Also comedy in no longer a right, you can practice law and medicine but no practicing personality.  Is this a scripted short, or is much of your dialogue plain out in the moment improv. What was the full pre production film clip time of this 33+ minutes. My former business partner and still elder cousin, is a male that has medically transformed his body into one of a female.

I am too busy trying to keep my own butt on the straight and narrow.  That is an old term. Straight meant at one time, a 'righteous & good well meaning lifestyle.  I was brought here to understand the fear a modern comedian has in trying to remain an individual and express what they think is funny without fear of jail, social poverty, career and possession loss.  There is a lot of education here, it is a walk down awareness lane. I do not want any judgement on my ability to not bow down to anyone. I may recognize anyone, I may not understand them, generally if they are not dependent on me, or I o them, I move on.  My cousin has also made me too aware of adjective pronouns, he & she, and possessive his/hers. So I now avoid them at al;l using you your their. Hey you! Don't get upset if I am illiterate to your language and definitions. Like the many songs we grew up with Spencer Davis Group's I'm a man',  Beautiful moment in time for some.  Even they were criticized for stealing Kool from the blacks, as if it was a racial trait.  I graduated from SFSU in Cinema (Doc) so I am in a tiny position to express my limited awareness, which cannot be right or wrong. I never was aware of mensturators, even youtube wants to autocorrect me.  Yes, I would like to know the status of one I am attracted to. To accept their position, and either continue or abort my intentions.  It is not always about sex. Perhaps knowlege, referral, or just plain friendship. Re we allowed to choose to MAKE a friendship or is that a bad thing now????  Well I will con tin my quest to learn the fear that lives inside the current comedian who must be so PC that they just are not fulfilled.. Walking the line was much easier, Chirsi Rock, Pryor, had privilege.  Gilbert Gottfried and Kramer (Michael Richard) were stifled quickly. Poor Pee Wee, was shot down for doing a normal thing in an abnormal place at the wrong time. , Advice- Never suggest money with anything you do. Aways tell women that the sex is free and that you expect no compensation, so you never get stung by the police department, no matter how hard they might try. Seduction is a one way street, only one is holding back for some reason.  Only do this if you record it and have a legally astute friend. Because being right and smart is not free.  Ask how much does a one hour massage cost, what is the range, never ask what they do in that hour. Do not agree or suggest. If they say 'would you like ......'  just reply,  I do not make suggestions, it is the decisions of the masseur/seuse as to what they wish to do or not. I expect any professional to be concerned utmost about their customer, do you agree, Wait for a yes...... if not they're probably a cop or a reserved employee.  Oh yeah, we were talking about 'blue comedy'. and its persecution.

"Damn, I really hate to hear that 'gender critical' is being used as a dog-whistle... I consider myself critical of gender because femininity/masculinity as defined by social behavior is a spectrum filled with often arbitrarily-defined 'gendered' signifiers. I don't see the complete abandonment of gender as realistic, at least in the short-term, but the pressures put on people to conform to either extreme of the spectrum is silly at best and extremely harmful at worst. A cis or trans man should be able to freely enjoy 'feminine' things while still identifying as a man, with the inverse being true for cis and trans women. And for those who feel a connection to both or to neither end of the spectrum, they shouldn't have to experience pressure to conform to one side or the other just for the sake of making other people feel more comfortable. That discomfort is irrational. At the barest minimum, even if someone cannot empathize with or understand those who don't fall neatly into hyper-feminine or hyper-masculine identities, tolerating flexibility within the gender binary is a pursuit of doing the least amount of harm - if someone is happier living as they are as opposed to how one thinks they should live, then why insist on the alternative? I recognize that this is an idealized view of how society SHOULD be rather than a reflection of what it is... but still. I don't like a phrase that is so broad being used to label such a very specific and narrow definition of how one should or shouldn't perform in the social gender construct. That flavor of 'gender criticism' is just reinforcing the gendered patriarchal divide that feminism-as-gender-equality aims to deconstruct and fight against.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There's a big point that got missed I think, which would go right about where the genderless skit went. Basically something like 'it's gender stereotypes and society that's set up all this is a man this is a woman stuff, so why can't you with all the clothes and makeup and fabulousness, dating guys, whatever, ALSO be what a man (XY) is?' I don't think the reenforcing gender stereotypes argument's opposite is genderlessness. Like, why can't this be a man you can 'miss/mame'? I feel like if we just came to understand gender as independent of sex, even if it's statistically correlated, then you wouldn't have to ride or coopt sexual terms so that you can have gendered features and treatment? which really has a lot of problematic aspects that... although you address them and make sense of WHY you do it and should do it, is just not accurate at the base level. You have XY biology. This is the confusion... if you take 'woman' to mean all the gender norms then yes you're a woman and more power to you, but why can't all this be you being a man? This is why I think a good compromise actually is 'transman' and 'transwoman', and realizing that those are just as equal as man and woman, but it also recognizes the physical reality. We can say a transman is a real man but also a real female/woman... masculine female? And this is the nomenclature problem that's causing issues with gender norms, imo. I hope I explained that right. Anyway, Great vid as always!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'women who had traumatic experiences with men and found comfort in a binary worldview where women are safe and men are dangerous' Sorry Contra Points, I know this is unpopular, but there is a HUGE elephant in the room here.  You are basically defending trans women by saying they don't count as men because they are discriminated in their own way, implicitly reinforcing that men are, in fact, intrinsically dangerous and deserving of prejudice by women who found comfort in a binary world view.  I'm not sure this is what gender equality should be about Perhaps that binary world view is a problem. Just saying.

"I really appreciate your attempt to reach out and try and educate the misinformed, it gives you a really approachable persona that's still somewhat lacking in a lot of other content creators I really like, so thanks very much for that. One thing I would say is that I do feel it would have been worth bringing up how lesbian lifestyles/identities are often brought into this - as someone with a lot of lesbian friends and icons, I'm seriously fed up with how it's being appropriated by TERFs, particularly in regards to lesbophobia. I was reading an article by Gay Star News showcasing a very clear example of lesbophobia in action, about how the lesbians being killed in Chechnya were talked about far less than the killing of gay men, because of how it tended to be carried out in secret, the lesbian victims being women tended to be dealt with by their families rather than in public. And in spite of this showcasing, some fucker still decided to comment that Gay Star News was somehow complicit in lesbophobia by being pro-trans. They were literally bringing the topic away from a serious discussion about an intersectional human rights violation to flaunt their first-world transphobia. It was immensely sickening. Outside of this discourse, I do feel that a lot of high-profile feminists tend to be heteronormative in their approaches - a lot of feminist pieces I find of relationships and sex seem to be almost exclusively about dating and sex-ing (not a word, but should be) men, so I kind of understand why lesbians are feeling erased, the 'gender critical' ones are just picking the wrong target. You mentioned something about cis women and trans women being pitted against each other when they really should be putted up a united front against social injustice, and I agree, and I think that's as true of lesbians as anyone else. I don't want this to feel like I'm bitching about your video, because it was incredibly well-made and has continued to cement your position as one of my favourite content creators of all time, this is just something that has been building up under the surface for ages and I needed to vent. :o Oh, and just to be clear, regarding my comments on Chechnya above, OBVIOUSLY I'm not saying that the killing of gay men being talked about means that everything's fine and dandy for them over there.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Even though I am a Black Lesbian Woman, I am not exempt from biogted views which you have successfully swayed with constructive arguments and rebuttals. I would just like to leave the comment that I am so happy you brought up the Trans-medical community, because most who make up the community I find, are trans people who go after other trans people for 'Not suffering the way I suffered and thus not being trans enough.' Which is something you also hinted at with this video. I used to watch Kalvin Garrah, Blair White, and few others who eased my mind to be transphobic and bigoted with those who were gender nonconforming, nonbinary, etc. I find that the LGBTQ+ community should stop attacking each other for 'not being the real deal' to 'not make the conservatives and under cover bigots hate us more' because this divides us and dissalludes what we REALLY should be after, AKA the asshats who force us to want their stamp of approval. I honestly without a doubt hope that you can talk about this situation/topic more and create a larger dialogue about how we [those who identify with LGBTQIA+ community] can try and combat not only our inner conflicts but also our outside oppressors.

TERFs) think they have a kind of 'trans-dar' and I can guarantee they don't, and they're actually really, really bad at it.

"One thing I think might help dissolve the conflict on some of these points is to differentiate between 'gender' in the sociological sense that has to do with role and presentation, and 'gender' in the psychological sense of how one feels about the sex of their body.

"Thank you for this. :)  As a teen I tried to become as androgynous as possible and actually succeeded in convincing people I was a woman, until I opened my mouth and shattered the illusion I projected. I was catcalled. But unlike a REAL woman I found this endearing, simply because it filled me with a sense of pride at what I was accomplishing. I had really not experienced sexism and misogyny in the same manner. There simply is no comparison between a biological woman's perspective of her world and a biological male's, even if they share a lot of overlap. I'm glad you're honest about this, perhaps even brutally so. If we're to ever accept the nuance and complexity of gender we need to be fair first and foremost and accept our limitations.  However, for much of my life I felt out of place, uncomfortable. Even though I blended with men and could interact with them with success, I never felt right. I never felt at ease (without a shitload of booze first) and find my mostly redneck brethren uncouth and difficult to take in large doses. I was always weaker, more emotional, and found their rituals distasteful and unnecessary. I never saw a future of a wife and children and husbandly duty without wanting to kill myself and kill myself (with a shitload of that same aforementioned booze) I tried.  Transitioning was something I only really discovered recently and it gave me hope at a future I could accept and work towards. That being said, I often questioned myself. Feminists say this. Cis say that. Even other transwomen have their opinions and those opinions can cut to the bone. My motivations have always felt scrutinized and dissected beneath a microscope.   * Do you hate your penis? No. But I can be quite indifferent towards it. * Are you really wanting to be a traditional woman? No. I have my own vision of womanhood. * You aren't super feminine, is this what you really desire? Yes. Again, own vision of womanhood.  So on and so forth...  It humors me how often the people who want to shed the gender and sex roles are often some of the most rigid traditionalists out there for those same roles. Sorry but I don't hate my penis. Sorry but I don't want to wear dresses constantly and tons of makeup. What I want is to have my hair in a ponytail, wear my nerdy ass glasses, use a light, modest amount of makeup and bask in the sin of plaid shirts and fucking denim while I smash the buttons on my playstation controller like a guerilla with my massive fucking ape hands. THATS WHAT I WANT.  This video makes me so happy because it argues the points that I've been wanting to argue for ages and how ironic it is that even those supposedly fighting for equality and an eradication of ludicrous social norms are still often being ensnared by those same norms. We will only be free of these shackles once we accept who we are. Both the things we're hurt to admit and the things we hide within us and are afraid to indulge to the fulfillment of our lives.  The only norm I give a shit about at the end of the day, personally, is finding a husband to my waifu and again, that's all down to preference.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Although I'm far from any kind of Terf ideology, I think the way you disregarded the 'Abolish Gender' argument is quite disingenuous. For me, it isn't about removing 'gender signifiers', but rather, it's about fighting against the idea that these practices should be thought of as inherently masculine or feminine in the first place. Basically, the goal is for everyone to act how they want to act, and wear whatever they want to wear, because they are individuals and not members of some gender group. I wouldn't 'deny trans people their gender identity' -- you can call yourself whatever you want to, and I'll address you however you wish, if it makes you more comfortable. I just think it's unhelpful as a whole to insist on upholding these labels, when they don't make an accurate distinction between individuals : i.e just because two people use the label 'woman' doesn't mean they are similar in many respects.  I think your analogy with the 'Abolish Borders' ideal is slightly flawed. While I do believe citizenship is also theoretically as arbitrary of a label as gender, in practice they are different. Practically, citizenship is steeped in international bureaucracy which determines people's rights and laws -- changing it would be one hell of a hassle. On the other hand, changing the meaning of 'Male' and 'Female' to refer to what kind of reproductive organs one has, would change next to nothing. People should just be individuals who act how they want ; the labels only refer to their genitals.  (again, let me re-emphasize that I have no problems with you identifying similarly to the traditional gender stereotype of a woman, whatever your biological sex -- that's fine with me. I just think you should do so as an individual, who has their own set of beliefs and differences with respect to that stereotype and thus shouldn't try to describe oneself by it).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

In other words you take apart and are critical of notions of Gender essentialism then the existence of Trans people should be food for your ideas. In that the very existence of Trans people at the very least puts into question, at least, certain notions of Gender essentialism and certain attitudes that Gender is binary.Instead 'Terfs' after talking about the absurdity of Gender essentialism then proceed to embrace Gender essentialism!!!! What the fuck!!! I just don't get it.And what makes it even funnier is that at least some Radical Feminists, such has Catherine McKinnon and the late Andrea Dworkin were perfectly willing to accept Trans Women has Women.I read The Transsexual Empire years ago and I have recently reread it. You know there is some actual points worth thinking about in the book. (Particularly the stuff about Transsexualism being used to push a binary attitude about Gender roles.)

It just makes it seem like you're not actually interested in engaging with opposing views (something that you accuse anti-SJWs of doing).

"I love and agree with almost every second of this, except one of the very last things you say, 'there's just no reasoning a transphobe out of bigotry', was that it? I may not have gotten it word for word, but that was the point of what you said at the very end, and I'm like, wait a minute, what has this channel been doing for the last couple years then?!?! I mean, I know that that's probably not the *goal* of the channel, or maybe it's one of the hopes you have.. idk, I obviously can't read your beautiful mind, Natalie, but I'm just very confused by that statement.   Sure, transphobia is largely a lizard brain, disgust response, I agree with you for the most part, but isn't your own movement to acceptance proof that it can be overcome?  My thing is I know several people who were transphobic, some of them pretty hardcore, and they were quite literally reasoned out of their bigotry by this channel, and concurrent 'educational' experiences over the last couple years. Forget transphobia, I can think of a bunch of bigoted perspectives that I know people like you have helped people to break free from.   Am I just missing something here? Surely you must know that at least one of the byproducts of your work has been getting bigoted people, transphobic or otherwise, to see the light? Are most bigots convinced?

"I'm leaving this comment here too because effortpost:  I liked this video but I just wanted to say that ime a lot of TERFs DO relentlessly attack cis women's expressions of gender, even famous ones. Some of the most virulently transmisogynist sites out there are full of self-described 'gender critical radfems' specifically  imageboards are dedicated to gang stalking both cis and trans women, with a focus on cis women who they deem to be unfairly tarnishing the reputation of the female gender (on some imageboards, there are hundreds of threads dedicated to trashing 'e-girls' who they deem to be amusingly mentally ill and unhinged.) Of course the great irony here is that the TERFs are the most active womanhood policers of them all towards trans AND cis women which obviously results in the perpetuation of gender stereotypes. My personal opinion and by examining the demographic of people who tend to be 'gender-critical' (personal experience too) is that a lot of these women feel threatened not just by trans women, but by cis women who they perceive to endanger their sense of the potential for self-individuation via femininity. Sure a lot of TERFs have been sexually traumatized or something in the past, but this just seems to result in their ironically clinging to womanhood while paying lip service to abolishing gender as a coping mechanism. Also, all of this animus results from the fact that a lot of gender-critical people describe themselves as 'apolitical' and thus lack any serious political convictions, let alone a sophisticated analysis of capitalism and how it affects gender and identity politics. Makes it easier for the gender critical people to engage in this endless projection game focused on individuals rather than structures ('patriarchy' in TERFdom is usually too ill defined and mercurial to be an actual structural analysis)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'excuse my beauty...!' hahaha, this is what grates me about terfs, their lack of appreciation for femininity, in itself misogynistic. As if women aren't supposed to ever WANT to be feminine; there are so many pressures, but I think it doesn't take much to notice the feminine women role models who MEAN their femininity; nor the basic dynamic of sex requiring a complementary relationship, at least between straight couples or masculinity and femininity as gender expressions in a more abstract sense. There's no reason to assume short hair or leg spreading should be neutral rather than masculine; nor that having long hair and wearing makeup should be feminine rather than neutral, on an individual basis.  Femininity is totally valid, and if some of it is derived from physical sex, then in that sense, it IS meant to complement the male counterparts - which is a funny point because by the lesbian terfs' own argument, their identity should be invalid because a female body is meant to be with a male body. It's so deeply cognitively dissonant.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"So, interestingly enough, there is actually more evidence for the 'female born in a males body' argument than just brain makeup. In essence during prenatal development hormones have a much larger impact on the way a person develops. These are called sensitive periods. Females who experienced extra androgens during certain developmental periods actually showed more male characteristics (Better performance on spatial tasks and more likely to play with things like trucks). This is important, as a lot of research shows that men perform better on spatial tasks (Yet, worse on other things, this isn't some kind of weird superiority argument). It's also been proven that boys with higher testosterone during sensitive periods are more likely to play with male typical toys. This was true regardless of socialization. The inverse of this phenomenon has also been shown to be true for males who received too little testosterone/too many estrogens  TL;DR When people are forming in the womb and shortly after hormones seem to be a determining factor in the degree to which a person expresses gender identity, at least in terms of the simple testable markers in current studies. (Female spatial task ability, gender typical toy choices) Socialization was not a factor in these studies (In fact, often parents had tried to socialize them TOWARDS their gender typical activities and failed This goes beyond the brain anatomy of men and women The affects of hormones aren't as strong outside of these sensitive periods SO it is possible that trans people genuinely have developed a 'soul' that is the opposite gender of their body.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

None of their theoretical basis actually even supports the conclusions they've come to, but really they just have for some reason thought that 'The Transexual Empire' is somehow not as bad as it is. I remember distinctly someone referencing a passage about how transwomen *shouldn't* be allowed to transition at all in any capacity (socially or otherwise) in order to protect women as an example of it not being 'that bad' when this was worse than I thought it would have been. Interactions with these people has moved me from radical feminism to Marxist feminism. I still disagree with liberal gender politics, but the fact these people contradict the positions of Shulamith Firestone(who called for the abolition of the sex distinction) or even Dworkin's stance that trans people should have full access to the means by which they can transition, is really painful and has pushed me out of their circles. That and some of them are culty as fuck and it seems a few of the women there prey on the other, and often younger, ones. Which is... Concerning... And even more so when there narrative is that basically every predator is actually a transwoman, sometimes they even just let cismen off the hook and view them less critically. It's weird and discomforting","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"love the video!!! my only addition would be that if TERFs truly cared about 'male socialization' they would ally w trans men, who experience 'female' childhoods yet also male privilege. i don't know about other trans men but i certainly still have instilled fears associated with the 'female' experience, like the constant awareness and fear of the possibility of sexual violence, and memories of my parents not allowing me to do things that my male friends could for fear of being raped. like if any men can empathize with that experience it's trans men!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"All these gender criticals appear to me as if they have a deep spiritual wound to the feminine, receptive principle of their being. They essentially mock any expressions of femininity, trans women being the easiest targets. I feel it is like a projection, where they reject those qualities in themselves, because being feminine made them feel powerless and hurt in some point of their life, rendering femininity as weak and something to protect. And by ferociously protecting, they are taking up the masculine principle, making a(n angry) disbalance... That all being said (by me, a person who felt degraded and used for being a really feminine girl), hate speech is not the way to healing, which they unconsciously seek.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Yes, exactly - the point of troll questions is they waste a lot of your time (and if you are not willing to waste your time, the troll takes the point). My new approach is to take the time to thoroughly answer the questions, with the proviso that the troll will listen throughout, will read (if applicable) and comment on, as well as review cited sources. BOTH of our times are gonna be wasted (the the case of a Gish gallop that can be a lot of time). And if a troll refuses to invest that kind of time in their own questions, they are loudly and publicly proclaimed a troll, and thus irrelevant, and from that point on any of their discourse on the subject on which they were trolling is ignored. And PS why do trolls always have all those stupid points and non-trolls don't? Because if you have one, good reason you tend not to sit around bolstering that good reason with a lot of shitty ones, and if shitty reasons are all you have, you try to have as many as possible.

"When I was younger, I was very much a TERF, but like, without knowing what that is or anything. I thought, here are these guys just waltzing into our space after enjoying a life of privilege and putting on a minstrel show of what they think it is to be a woman - boobs, hips, dresses and makeup.   Growing up, I wished that I could be a man, but the surgical transition from female to male (especially in terms of genitalia and its sexual functioning), seemed mutilating. I came to the conclusion that I could never be a man, that even if I were to transition to being a man, that underneath it all I would still be a woman because of the years of conditioning as a woman. So I resigned myself to being a woman, but I decided to not let my gender stand in the way of who I wanted to be, what I wanted to do, and where I wanted to go (or at least to the extent that is possible within legal and social restrictions).   I guess this is why I disliked transsexuals. It was in part a sense of jealousy at how much easier it is (at least by perception) to transition from being a man to a woman. I figured, if I can live as a woman and be satisfied simply having male tendencies, why can't these people just live in their assigned bodies, and do what I do? Secondly, I found it annoying (and still do really) that transsexual woman get so much attention from the media while trans men are left in the shadows. It's like, even when presenting as women, men get more spotlight. Thirdly, I thought, why in hell would a man want to give up all the privilege to become a woman? I thought, if they knew, like really knew, what it was like to be a woman, they wouldn't do it. So to me, that willingness to transition was a signal that trans women had a very simplistic view of womanhood.  But with some thought, I realized that transitioning comes with its own set of issues and dangers, and if someone was willing to go through all that, then who am I to add to their burdens? I still think the world is sexist and it's not fair, but transsexual men didn't make it that way. They're just as much a victim of this shit as anyone else, often more bc as you said, at least I'm a 'she' and not an 'it' and the people I sleep with (in general) will publicly acknowledge me. I can retreat into my sex and 'hide' whenever I need to or want to, but as a trans, you're putting yourself out there in a way that's scary and bold. And for that reason, I'm a little bit in awe, because anyone brave enough and resilient enough to live life their way in the face of dickheads and assholes is admirable. (And isn't living your life with grace, inner strength, and resilience the essence of being of woman?!)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"15:30 on the topic of masculine uprising. Content(warning): male tears:  This was one of the biggest things keeping me out of feminism, the way male uprising is treated as some form of gift. For sure, it is a position of extreme priviledge, and for sure, the role young girls get is usually the victim of that system.  But being rased as a winner in this sick hiearchical system is, ironically enough, not a treat. The role of a master is psychologically damaging, leaves young men with disfunctional feelings and severed sense of humanity, and forces them to a constant battle against eachother and oppressed groups. And while that role is definitely antagonistic and deserves to be fought against, the priviledge is never enough to satisfy.  This leaves us men in a weird spot. We carry out the same sins of our fathers, but it brings no joy. For most it's a role of misery and pain. We are told the only way out of those 'growing pains' is to rise to the position of masters of the status quo, become the fully aknowledged part of the hierarcy, and constantly strive towards a higher position. At some point this starts probably starts feeling okey, and at the end when you are fifty and people forgive you for shittalking transpeople because 'you are old and important', your head is probably deep enough in your own arse that you tickle your own prostate.  But in my opinion, never does this system actually benefit most men. That's the thing about hierachies. Most supporters are there to lose less - not to enjoy their priviledge. The elevated position is just a couping mechanism for dealing with even higher elevated position.  Opressing and hate can never truly fullfill ones needs. And for me, that summarises my experience as a man. And that is why im feminist. For my own sake, so I myself one day could suffer less from the toxicity I used (and still) inflict on others.  Now some want to call this mentears and whatnot. And that is fair. My point is that men-tears actually come from the same origin. The priviledged class is not a winner - we men just lose less. And that message is an important weapon for connecting with young men like myself, who so often - as we are trained to react - attack feminism because young men feel it's a threat to our personal success. In reality, young men suffer from perverted definition of success, fighting against eachother and hurting those in weaker position, to climb towards a role that can never truly satisfy human needs.  I don't wish to define genders, but I do wish to destroy any hierarchy assosiated with them.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think you can reason some transphobes out of transphobia. When i first saw trans people when i was around 16 i didn't understand, i didn't get it at all and said vaguely transphobic things, like 'why do you want to be a woman', 'you will never be a real woman and you won't be able to give birth'. I saw trans youtubers say 'i am a real woman' and i just didn't get it, so thought they were delusional. What changed my mind was when a trans woman simply expressed that they know they aren't a biological female, but they feel happier living their life as a woman, now that i could understand, i have always been of the attitude just let people live the way they want to live and express themselves they want to, so simply saying they feel happier living that way was enough to then make me accepting. I then learned about the difference between biological sex and gender and the brain structure evidence for trans people.   Then many years before the 'are traps gay' memes and debate, i saw a ted talk basically explaining that anonymous data collected from all the porn sites showed that a vast many straight men watch porn of trans women, the reason being they look like women,  men are mostly visual in their arousal, so seeing breasts a feminine face and body all still arouse men. It made sense because gay men aren't for the most part aroused by feminine bodies and appearance, they are attracted to masculine bodies and appearance. People are not primarily attracted by genitals , you can't see them when your in public, but yet you still see people that are very attractive to you.   So rather than giving up on reasoning transphobes out of transphobia, i think it is likely the only way forward, just saying the discussion is off the table isn't going to work. Gay people would have never got acceptance if it wasn't for them explaining to people how they feel and the hate and abuse they have received and the science backing it.  Some people may still consider me a transphobe because my understanding from the science is there are 2 biological sexes, i think gender can vary, but the reason i understand biological sex is truly binary is because biological sex has to do with reproduction and to reproduce you need 2 components, 1 sperm and 2 an egg. Intersex people exist ofc but to my knowledge none of them have 2 sets of functioning reproductive organs, so they can't reproduce with both sexes, i haven't seen any intersex people that are mid way between sexes, i have only seen them as like 98% 1 way or the other with a medical condition that is an anomaly. A persons sex isn't solely determined by genitals or gonads, its a combination of traits and structures, just like being human is not defined by 1 sole feature, its a collection of features and structures. Humans typically have 2 legs, that does not mean someone born with 1 leg is not human or that humans are now on a spectrum of how many legs they have, no they are fully human just that their amount of legs is anomalous in the population where the other 99% of humans are born with 2 legs. Exceptions to a rule do not disprove a rule, unless there are more exceptions to the rule than apply to the rule.  I am willing to change my mind on the science, i am willing to be shown to be wrong, but so far i haven't heard a convincing argument or seen evidence contradicting my view.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I wouldn't say I was ever a TERF, but at an earlier point in my life, I shared many of these concerns about what transgender people meant to the feminist discourse I knew.  [Long story warning!]   I was a huge tomboy as a child, and enjoyed stereotypically male play and clothing. I found it extremely unfair that the type of play I enjoyed and clothes which were actually comfortable were the domain of boys. I remember saying something to the effect of 'I wish I was a boy!' to my mother at around age 9-10. In the early 2000s, my mother interpreted this as me rebelling against gender norms. She subscribed to the 2nd wave feminist views she grew up with in general. Her insight helped me through those feelings of inadequacy and rightly identified that it was a case of what would nowadays be called 'gender non-conformism'. She bought me what she considered 'unisex' (now, gender-neutral?) clothing (it was boys clothing that didn't scream BOY), let me cut my hair and took me to Judo class. After puberty, I became more feminine and gender conforming and my life became a lot easier.  When trans activism started gaining traction recently, I went back to my 9-year-old tomboy self and asked: 'If this were today, would my mother have thought I was a transgender boy?' This bothered me deeply. I thought 'How many girls like me could be misinterpreted because of gender stereotypes!?' This lead me to have many TERFy concerns expressed in this video. Mainly: 'We should be moving AWAY from gender' and stuff like that, especially when it comes to children. Stories about parents letting their trans children pause* puberty to facilitate transition later horrified me.   Of course, I never really wanted to be a boy. I wanted to be free, like Sylvia Plath, of what I perceived were tethers holding me down because I was a girl. Once I realised this distinction, between gender non-conformism and gender dysphoria, I started taking some steps towards more sane lines of thought. I wanted to understand what trans people thought of gender issues. After I opened my eyes and actually decided to hear trans voices, I pretty much alleviated all of my concerns.  I'm now proud to call myself an intersectional feminist and hope we can achieve gender equality not only for our cis sisters but also for our trans sisters, who came to share our gender later in life. I hope we can break these rigid gender norms together and allow girls and boys of the next generations to be free.  *edited","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Kim Petras still experienced a radically different childhood from cis women/girls because she had a say in things. That's not to say that she chose to be female, but she did choose to be treated as one by coming out. Perhaps she was choosing between life and death there, but she still chose nevertheless, and that's a choice that cis women never get. They get womanhood violently forced onto them from birth and never have a say in the matter or get to formulate thoughts on their womanhood until much, much later. The understanding of gender and agency that trans girls (and I mean girls, not women) have is something that cis girls never have.  I think that age of transition matters a lot less than what people around you treated you as. Sure, the life experiences of a trans woman who came out as soon as she could speak would be different from an old trans woman who had a wife and several biological children before coming out, but I would still say they have more in common with each other than the early transitioner does with a cis woman.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think the transmedicalist position was a bit over-simplified. The only 'doctrine', so to speak, of the transmed ideology is that some level of gender dysphoria is expected- not an intense self-hatred but at least a disconnect from your assigned gender. The majority of us seem to be trans men who are tired of this idea that anyone is trans just because they say so, which leads to peoples ideas of being being able to identify as attack helicopters and detransitioners and people who think they can 'experiment' with gender by going on hormones only in the end to cause themselves actual dysphoria. Saying your transgender without dysphoria is like saying you're depressed but don't experience depression. There's just integral part to the experience of being transgender that can't be ignored without consequences.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I know that the gaming community at large is TOXIC, but derailing a toxic society is hard and takes a lot of work from those trying to oppose it, and to say yes all gamers is kind of ignorant of some of the efforts by gamers to really change the culture for the better. The super smash bros community, for example, is highly toxic and although there are prominent females in the scene, they are constantly berated and attacked for anything they do, BUT there are some people who publicly oppose this culture and they shouldn't be attacked for trying to experience a dynamic piece of art and better its community. Omni for example, who has a youtube channel by the same name, frequently speaks up about these issues and has called out the misogyny of the community every time it prevails. He's even made donation funds to go to top placing women at tournaments. I won't pretend even for a second that he's perfect, but if the argument here is that gamers are bystanders by participating in toxic communities, I think he derails that a little bit.

"More and more I find that it is a privilege to be able to calmly discuss the issue at hand without becoming emotional and 'losing it'. People who have had traumatic experiences are often unable to make the best arguments, because the bitter taste in their mouth is such that they can only scream. If you've had cock shoved down your throat (often literally) your whole life, it's understandable that you'll have a hard time feeling safe when there's cock around. If you've been expected to hide and apologize your whole life, then it's understandable when you lash out at the insinuation that you should 'tone it down'. I feel I've worked on my trauma enough to be able to do so and not scream, so here are my concerns.   I feel you make a number of great points, Natalie (and thank you for taking on this wasp nest of a topic) but when you talk about the reptilian-brain disgust-type response to trans people, it strikes me that mysoginy works the same way -- there's no shortage of gay men and trans women expressing their disgust of the female (xx) anatomy and bodily functions. It is dehumanizing and hard to defend, even though I am aware that the people spilling this crap are often very traumatized, as I've mentioned above. I'm sure you too, Natalie, as a student of all things bigoted, have read the violent, slurry discourse online from both sides (transfeminists and radfems).   I watched this 'internet feud' dismantle some of the most powerful feminist online spaces and have since taken my activism elsewhere (offline) because I was losing my mind. I can put a man in his place at 8am before my cup of tea, but I can't be knocking down other women in a space meant to be safe for women. The feminist internet battlefield is a patriarchal dream. In my personal experience, the Trans v. TERF battles showed up largely as an issue of access, and I honestly don't see the harm in most instances of so-called exclusion. To me, it's alsmost a non-issue that some feminist spaces will naturally be oriented to cis-women, and that others will naturally be oriented to trans-women, and that others will be intersectional and larger. They don't need to be officially exclusionary, but it is a very organic thing that the more specific a discussion becomes, the more exclusionary it will feel -- I mean, can you imagine a cis-lesbian claiming protagonism at a trans forum and calling everyone 'lesbophobes' because the topics of discussion don't apply to her experience? Of course trans people have a right to define their experience (and need the time and safe space to do so) of womanhood, but the vaporization of all things 'woman' does make it hard to have the conversations that are necessary to healing, for both cis and trans women, I'm guessing. I wonder if it'd be as comfortable for  a trans woman discussing an experience related to her own 'female penis' (for example) to get vulnerable online in a community where a cis woman might 'chime in' without necessarily being invited to do so. Frankly what I see (as a privileged 'not so broken that I can't think about it calmly' cis woman) is a two diverse groups of traumatized people who are hurting so bad they need healing spaces.   Also, I notice that people who have been disenfranchised for a long time have a hard time acknowledging that they do have some power to hurt another. But here's the thing, though: when transfeminists and radfems are pitted against one another online, this makes the inextricably  connected -- and this is heightened when we only amplify the most radicalized voices in both sides of the dispute: the violence against the (perceived) other is soothing for the traumatized at a certain point. Yet both transfeminists and radical feminists, including the 'gender critical' in question, have more pressing issues to address than each other. That's when actual radical feminist theory comes in handy. Transfeminists and radfems attacking one another do less to expose the other 'team's' phallacies and blind spots than to give a pass to the real oppressor. You know, the ones historically killing us off and brutalizing us? The root of the problem so to speak?   It bothers me immensely that radical feminism has become (on the internet anyway) synonymous with 'don't bring your trans girlfriend to our soiree' -- it's a spaying and neutering of a brilliant theory that describes the world in a very accurate way. Just as marxism, it describes the world based on a particular point in history. Is marxism a perfect way to describe the world in 2019? Fuck, no. But it is useful to describe changing dynamics -- like a pair of glasses you can put on to look at something from a Marxist perspective. Radical feminism is a very useful way to look at the power dynamics in the gender binary, and while it does not account for the whole gender spectrum it is certainly useful to understand historical patterns in this changing world. I suppose what really bothers me is the silencing and fear that pushes 'moderates' to the sidelines and turns the entire dispute of online spaces between TERFs into a screaming match. Can everyone just put down the baseball bats for a second? Here's hoping. ;)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm not entirely sure if this is going to make a whole lot of sense, but when it comes to whether I always was a man or became one when I started transitioning I've always come out with 'was always a man'. I would constantly mentally correct people when they called me by female pronouns, I never managed to consider myself 'one of the girls' despite only ever hanging out with them, and if left to my own devices I would always find ways to act more boyish. It was more like people perceived me to be a girl and therefore only interacted with me as if I was a girl, rather than me being one. Like the people around me never saw 'The Real Me'. And if they never saw the real me, can I ever claim to have been a girl? I'm not going to claim we're two completely different people, but if I could always look at her and say 'Practically none of this resembles me at all. Yea, you've got the basics, but it's all twisted into a fundamentally different framework. How could I ever look like that?' can I reliably claim that 'I' was a girl?  On a different note, I'm kind of curious as to trans men's and NB's place in this discussion. It feels like no matter where I go it's mostly either people hating on trans women or trans women making the best of their situation. Even with people just citing trans people it always seems to go back to trans women with two exceptions that I've found so far. NBs haven't even got that though, as far as I can tell. It sometimes comes off as if we're hated as a byproduct of people hating trans women, and that we're mostly forgotten by the side fighting for our rights and wellbeing. I don't think that's necessarily the case or that any of it is done intentionally in the off chance that it might be how things are. I completely understand that trans women have a lot of things to deal with, especially if you're part of another minority group as well. I don't want to undermine or take away from the struggles you go through. I'm more curious as to whether these feelings are somewhat justified or if I'm just really bad at looking for these things","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"FWIW, although Gender Abolition is often co-opted by bad faith TERFS, it's also a concept that's been developed by a lot of trans people (myself included) who think of abolishing gender as exactly that long term project that abolishing borders or prisons is, with the goal not being abolishing gendered characteristics (everyone being genderless robots) but for gendered characteristics to not be attached to symbolic power structures that restrict gendered expression and play, and I don't think it's exactly fair to characterize it as a pie in the sky Utopia when the reality of the process of gender assignation at birth is something is something that intersex people advocate for the end for because the specific violating way that the process affects them.   Abolition isn't destruction of gendered characteristics, it's a deconstruction of the system policing it, and reconstructing a new system that works for people who aren't just binary (this is in line with a lot of writings on Prison Abolition by Angela Davis and Ruth Wilson Gilmore if anyone's interested on the history of Prison Abolition as a concept!)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I love this video along with so many others of yours but the only issue I had was the poor representation of what transmedicalism is. Transmeds do not believe that being trans is based off suffering or hating yourself. The only belief transmeds have as a whole is that you need gender dysphoria to be trans. You can love yourself and be trans. You can be GNC and trans. You can be happy and trans. But you are only trans if you have a disconnect between your mental gender and body (aka dysphoria). It's a medical fact and dysphoria is what drives trans people to, Well, be trans. If someone didnt have a disconnect with their birth sex, why would they want to transition? And if they do transition, they'll only give themselves dysphoria when they end up looking like the opposite sex when they didn't want to, Being trans is not a choice and LGBT people have to fight to let people know it is not a choice but people who are against transmedicalism make being trans out to be a choice.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"it took me very few contacts with TERFs and their rhetoric to recognize that their core beliefs are centered around making their poorly concealed,  bigoted hatred for trans women seem like a rational thing to do if you want to fight for women's rights, and as it always happens with ideologies based on hatred and exclusion, a lot of their rhetoric makes me, a cis lesbian, feel extremely unsafe, constantly patronized and objectified for my womanhood. in attempts to exclude trans women as much as possible, TERFs will and do attack other women for performing their femininity wrong, ostracize them for not doing the right kind of feminism or purposefully misgender them for standing up for trans women. i feel reduced to bunch of glamorized stereotypes of abstract female goddess hailed for having ovaries by TERF/radfem crowd, instead of just a human who happened to be born female and is comfortable with it   i know and acknowledge that the most of the heat from TERFs and radfems is aimed at trans women, but as i look at how many young lesbians adopt radfem lite ideas and then start openly supporting trans-exclusive movements, i look how radfems are outright using covert tactics, akin to crypto-fash crowd, flirting with the ideas of how much you can exclude from LGBT without outright stating 'drop the T' and see what starts rooting in queer spaces (see tumblr now). i think that a good way to start diverting young women, especially queer, from being recruited into this movement is by learning that TERFs are not friends for cis women either.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Most noticeably you haven't engaged whatsoever with probably their main criticism: Self-ID leading to an erosion of female protections - whether in terms of safeguarding or in the job-market or in sports. I see myself as a 'centrist' in this discussion, and I don't agree with a lot of what terfs say, but I see way more shady tactics (no platforming, aggressive behaviour, ad hominems, logical fallacies) on the trans side of the discussion and its hard not to factor that in.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"First of all: thank you for making this video. I have tried to find other sources to where these conversations are had, but it seems in every forum I frequent these discussions and the people trying to have them have been dismissed as transphobic. (Which I also understand better now, after you explained how it's often used as time-wasting trolling. I kind of feel like I should have understood it without explanation considering I have experienced the same thing debating incels and nazis... so I guess that's on me.) I understand the need for trans people to protect their own mental health, but for me it lead to random tumblr posts of varying terfiness being the most readily available source material on these things, which is... not ideal. So again, thank you for taking the time to tackle this and present your viewpoints. It has helped clear up some misunderstandings I've had about how radical feminism and trans feminism fit together.  About the 'abolish gender' argument: I get where you are coming from, but at the same time it frustrates me when people simply dismiss it. Partly because we have actually made progress towards that goal. Partly because I actively try to break free from and advocate against gender roles in my everyday life and encourage people to not let gender roles restrict them, and I experience the social repercussions of it: awkward silences, ridicule, contempt, or just plain disgust. I absolutely agree that the 'calling out' should be targeted primarily towards influencial cis people, because, well, they are the ones doing most of the influencing... And I act accordingly. But when people talk about how their barista should have known not to call them by a masculine pronoun because they were wearing makeup, or how their parents always knew deep down they were a boy because they liked trucks, or how they just love doing housework since they began taking estrogen, they still validate the same structures. Again, I get that trans people risk worse backlash than I do and need to protect themselves, and that drawing upon socially accepted discourse helps them do so, but it does not make encountering another argument about the 'female soul' any less frustrating. Especially because libfems and antifems are always so quick to jump on it and go 'yes, see, women are just naturally like this because nature, no need to think about social structures'. And honestly, I think a lot of the backlash against trans people, nb people and other members of the queer community exists precicely because people are stuck in the whole evo psych 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus' gender binary bulls*it, and simply can't handle the thought of people with prostates wearing dresses.  If anyone reading this feel like they have something to add or disagree with me on anything in this post, I would be very thankful if you took the time to reply. I am legitimately trying to work this stuff out, but I'm not perfect.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You say that you perform over-the-top femininity because you're afraid of being misgendered or not being seen as 'woman enough' - what does that say about transgenderism? That in fact there is more to manhood and womanhood than performing masculinity and femininity. Performing femininity is the only thing that is stopping you from being recognised for what you are - a male. It's an illusion, a performance. You're just overcompensating because you know that people will see you for what you are if you don't. Most natural women don't have to worry about not being perceived as a woman even if we don't act super feminine because it's evident by just looking at us and listening to us. We have female voices, female bodies, female bone structure, etc. I've yet to know of a transwomen that doesn't speak like an extremely effeminate gay male. We have different bodies and that is reflected in how we are perceived. Transwomen may be able to imitate certain body parts and gender affectations, but they will never be a whole woman.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's funny because, being someone who *kinda* get some points of both sides of the matter, TERF still sound kinda ridiculous to me for many points The only situation that I'd slightly agree to their point of view is when someone tries to 'justify' (as if it needs to be justified) their trans-ness by lines such as 'I liked playing Barbie as a child!' 'I like pink!' and very simple things culturally associated to the female universe. But it's simply rude to think only your way of thinking is valid and deny that trans women find a safe place in the 'female universe'. Why can't you just let people be what they want to be and feel more comfortable being, when it's not harming you or other people?    Another thing I don't get is the *literal* 'man-hatred'. First of all, because it ends up adding to that 'feminists hate men' thing and makes it seems like a true statement. Second of all, because the 'all men are naturally scummy and will always be' is basically adding to the patriarchy conception that men have the right to do some scummy actions because that adds to their masculinity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a guy who does not really identify as a radical feminist, but is mostly in agreement with their arguments, I may have a biased or sometimes wrong view on where the radfems do indeed stand, but I still feel like I can add a bit to the discussion.  Many of your radfem arguments are things I have heard or read them say indeed, so kudos to you, for not misrepresenting those. Nevertheless I feel like you don't really engage with them fairly. One of the problems, is that you make concessions the trans movement in general doesn't seem to make. For example you are saying that it is ok to call male people words that reduce us to our genitalia too, but in the end it is just not done, so the question prevails: Why is this sort of dehumanizing language mostly used for women? Also why not use male people and female people, aren't these perfectly fine words to signify biological sex? Furthermore, radfems use the terms TIM and TIF for very similar reasons, you have for using the term TERF, they think they otherwise would be making concessions to an ideology they do not agree with and which they think is dangerous.  Another thing is that you say, they are acting in disgust, because you have seen a few radfems being disgusted by a transwomen, I agree that some do behave like that, but to me that does not seem representative of the movement. You say that 'there is no way, that transwomen could behave, that terfs would accept', because they oppose 'transwomen being transwomen' but I think you slightly miss the mark here. They oppose the idea that transwomen can be women, which also means they have a problem with most transwomen regardless of how they behave, as long as they seem to believe, that they are women, most of them (but not all) seem to be fine with dragqueens for example. They simply think any transwomen who says they are a woman is delusional (the same obviously goes for transmen who say they are men).  In my mind suggesting to transpeople to undergo transition to cure their dysphoria seems akin to telling a paranoid person: ''They' are really out there to get you, but don't be afraid, I can sell you a gun and home security systems.'  There are also a few important arguments, that you seem to have missed, but I think this is enough textwall for now.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thank you for this, I really did appreciate your approaching with nuance and I hope I listened with nuance as well. I'm a cis woman who has never been educated enough about feminist theory to hold an ideological stance, so nuance may be the only way I can engage in this space anyway (I'm 57 now and only learned ten years ago that feminism came in waves). My experience of being a woman was growing up as a tomboy, being interested in science and making stuff, being told I must be a lesbian because of that (and experiencing a lot of confusion about my sexual attraction to men as a result) working to he taken seriously in male spaces (physics major in college being told - literally, in those words - by professors that I don't belong, ocean going engineer being told - literally and accompanied by physical intimidation - that I don't belong, decades of such experiences).  So. I was with you on almost everything here. But one thing I was hurt by was your somewhat mocking tone when you read the quote from Sylvia Plath. She was expressing very precisely something that gets directly at a source of very deep pain for me, that is also directly related not just to my hurt feelings but also to professional struggles and the way I have had to work much harder and be much better just to fight my way to a place at the table that cis men were granted without question. So I guess my point is, please don't mock or belittle that.  You have experiences that were every bit as difficult, of course. It's not for me to grade whose shit stories are more shitty, and you were careful to make that same point - again, you have approached this topic with a nuance I've not heard before (from cis or trans women, but then, and I'm not a gender theorist, just a person doing my basic things). So. Here comes the thing that is my personal source of frustration, and the only thing I have to say that I would I guess like for a trans person to just acknowledge as valid. What I see a woman being accepted and taken seriously in tech spaces, or gamer spaces (accepted as a player, not a entertainment streamer), I get super excited. And then it seems that a high percentage of the time (considering the numbers ratio of cis women to trans women in the general population) the woman turns out to be a trans woman. My heart sinks a little because it feels like cheating to be able to get a seat at that table as a man and then transition or come out as a trans woman. I really, really hope that trans women who do get that seat at the table will reach down and help women up, not just other trans women but also cis women who, like Sylvia Plath, have been longing their whole lives, yes, since very young girl hood, to be accepted there. I say this hoping it's not taken as an attack. I entirely agree with you that trans women have experiences of womanhood that are shitty, and are at greater risk than I of violence, and experience much greater workplace discrimination than I do, just for being trans. This thing I feel is just a twinge compared to all that, and compared to the very significant consequences that come with being a woman of any description. I know it's a twinge I can only have because I am in a position of privilege from being white, cis and middle class. Anyway, I'm hoping to engage, and hope I don't invoke wrath by invading a space that is safe for trans women. Causing offense is certainly not my intention, and I'm open to criticism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Trans women arguably understand what it means to be a woman far better than cis women. They might not suffer from sexism as much until they come out but when they do, they suffer from it double the amount of a cis woman in their condition. They also know how to weaponise femininity and show that it's just as strong as masculinity while so many cis women are afraid of being feminine, or they associate strength with being like men. I know because I did, my cis female friends did. All in all, TERFs can fuck right off with their bullshit arguments.

"Speaking from the privilege of a millenial cis woman lol, i must say i never really understand the plight of the terf. it insults me that they even call themselves 'radical feminists' because i personally feel it muddies the feminist name, which there are already huge misconceptions about. i can sorta, kinda get the theory of this fear of 'men invading womens spaces', but mainly not as it is evidently clear that is not really any issue at hand. the fear of men invading spaces that aren't meant for them in order to keep women safe is not gonna be resolved by banning all trans women? that doesnt even make sense? a person who is set to invade a space for negative reasons will surely feel free to do that regardless of their gender identity, sort of seems to come with the word 'invade'? if feminism is about freeing oppression, which i believe it is, for things that people cannot control (such as their gender), i absolutely do not understand why these women would want to kick other women out of it and try to deny their existence. i dont understand how a movement that has strived for so long to be seen as more than just a vagina and a womb would start othering other women because of their lack of one. for me radical feminism is about abolishing all semblance of gender's suffocating role in society, however, as you said, that is an entirely utopian idea that we aren't even close to seeing as a reality yet. so in lieu of that, feminism has to be a sisterhood of protection for the people who are vulnerable and need it. i personally believe it is the role of more privileged women to provide that safe and welcoming place for those who aren't as safe in a world that struggles to accept them. the semantics of 'what makes a woman' shouldnt really come into it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"20:41 So regarding reproductive rights, aS a NoNbInArY pErSoN,  I feel pretty left out and ignored when discussing these issues. They are so centered around women that while some of our experiences are similar, they still don't bring up issues that I may face. I'm not sure, there is this sense of dysphoria and alienation when I enter these spaces because they are really female dominated and focused. It's like it reminds me of the gender that I was assigned at birth that I don't connect with at all. When reproductive issues are only centered around women, I am not sure if people in that space are educated and tolerant of nonbinary people, let alone trans people.   After hearing horror stories of trans people and medical spaces, and even experiencing some myself, I have to be extremely careful if the medical professionals that I'm dealing with are not prejudiced. It is agreed upon that women need services like contraception and abortion, but it's also accurate that trans men and nonbinary people need these services as well. It makes me feel safe and included that places like planned parenthood are using neutral language to refer to usual gendered services. That shows at least one sign that maybe I can trust the medical professionals in that organization to really tell them what is going on. Or else, I may have to make up a story to 'seem' cis in case the person I am dealing with might have biases.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Ugh, I hate to be critical, since this is the first video I have a major problem with. I think it's such a shame to have so carefully unpacked TERF arguments and concerns, to then at 28:25 reduce the argument to 'it's all transphobia, which exists in every culture, because we're born with an innate sense of disgust for trans people that anatomically exists in our limbic system' (to paraphrase). I think there's more to it ; there's internalized misogyny (cis women treat each other terribly too), there's a concern about which ideas should get more of a public platform (I mean, we've been fighting for abortion rights and contraception for well over 60 years, and it's still an urgent issue), and most cis women will never know what dysphoria and misgendering feels like (which is why I identify as a cis - rather than trans - non-binary queer and I love it when old people with poor eyesight call me 'sir'). I'm not trying to minimize transphobia or refute any of the claims about how transphobia affects trans people. But there have been many societies where transphobia wasn't a thing. Take the example of Hijras, who before the British rule, were considered valuable members of their communities in many Indian cultures.  I don't know where I'm going with this. To wrap it up, what really bothered me was comparing the disgust for the LGBT community to the instinct of disgust for feces and disease.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I spent so much of my life trying not to be transgender and spouting the same bullshit as a lot of '''gender critical''' feminists because I was ashamed.

"I'm very glad you're showing how there are different types of trans people and how gender transitioning isn't always done for one reason; because you have felt like the opposite gender from birth.  In reality people can have very different reason for transitioning, and may have felt okay with their assigned birth gender for quite some time.  Also, being referred to as 'it' is something that can happen to cis women, namely those who aren't deemed attractive to men.  They effectively deny your gender, forcing you to be something in the middle.  During school I considered if I was trans because of this very thing.

"It seems to me like a decent chunk of the issues and confusion around trans folk is... laungage. Words. Meaning.  Since trans folk are such an extreme minority, and 'non-binary' are a minority of that minority, they seem to dive in to a kind of emotionalist view of language that demands it be as bespoke to their extremely niche 'gender identity'.   I'll try and explain. I think it could be said that *there are as many genders as there are people.* But that the words 'man' and 'woman' satisfy the extreme majority of humans conception of their own identity. So, when it comes to the niche marginal groups, gendered language and these concepts buck against their identity. The fact that much of what we accept about our own identity is how others perceive us, and that the 'binary' laungage pushes people outside of the gender firmament seems to be a pretty big issue.  As far as I can tell, I am a man, what a phillistine from the jungles of borneo would recognize as man, and that recognition IS what makes me a man. Ultimately, I can never truly be a woman, setting aside the biology of sex differences, but I can only become a woman to the extent that I can essentially game the perceptions of others into seeing me as a woman.   I guess I mean 'passing'. If you aren't passing then you won't be perceived as a woman, therefore you are not a woman?  Woman, as in half of the two massive chunks of aggregated unique genders from all humanity lumped in to these signifying words. Man. Woman.   To go beyond the language of 'are trans-women women?' Seems to ask of the English language something it wasn't really made to say.

"On the subject of inclusive language, we do have to recognize it's a delicate balance. I have seen transmen state categorically that the statement that 'reproductive freedom is a women's issue' or discussing 'A woman's right to choose' is inherently transphobic, because some men experience pregnancy too. And it's true that some men menstruate and get pregnant, but it also seems that telling women that they are immediately transphobic if they refer to 'women' when discussing pregnancy in an activist, not medical, context, feels an awful lot like men (transmen in this case) dictating to women what vocabulary they can and cannot use to discuss issues that affect overwhelmingly more women than men.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There's no hope anyone will see this but I need to try - I love you Contra, you're brilliant, but you lump people into groups too much :/  you didn't once cover the fringe cases that cause so much of the emotion behind terf arguments, like the male rapist who decided he was suddenly female and was put into a women's prison where he immediately assaulted several women, which happened due to the strict antidiscrimination laws in the uk. I don't think people who have a problem with that should be lumped into the 'terfs who just hate trans people'  category.   I've been trying to bring this up as an issue that trans people should be fighting as it damages you so much in the public eye and can be weaponised against you so easily. I wish we could give it a name - I've settled on 'psychotic trans impersonation' but I don't care what we call it ultimately I just want to protect good people from the unintended consequences of inclusion when it's written into law and so vehemently enforced that it genuinely does harm women.   Terfs are often the very women who have suffered the worst at the hands of men and are disgusted and freaked out by trans people because of a very real trauma in their past, and while I don't agree with man-hating any more than I agree with transphobia I don't think it's ok to write off their strongest arguments, especially when those arguments damage trans people too.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

While 'trans women are women' is a nice sentiment, it doesn't help trans women who are struggling to understand the validity of their own existence. I think a lot of us have the same questions about our validity and existence as cis people do and that can be a very scary thing to admit if you don't even have the answers yourself. It's something I've struggled with even up until watching this video (and I'm 5 years into hormones and all that). So while I respect and appreciate what this does to help educate uninformed cis people, I also appreciate what this might do for trans girls like me who have always had those same questions and concerns that put us at odds with our own identities and feelings of self-worth. For that and so much more, I thank you.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You'll probably never see this comment, but I wanted to thank you so much for this video.   I'm a cis-female and I do struggle with discussing different experiences of womanhood with trans women. I never, ever want to be hurtful or offensive, I've been reduced to tears because I've tried so hard to listen & understand everything they are kind enough to share, but still got accused of being transphobic because I feel there are differences between a person growing up female as opposed to someone growing up feeling they are female.  I'm not saying 'You're not a real woman' and I'm also not saying 'I'm *more* of a woman than you' either, none of that. We're equals. I just feel we have different experiences of womanhood and what's wrong with talking about our respective experiences?  Your dialogue about this really helps so much, and I can't wait to share it and hopefully promote conversation with folks I know.   I don't want a trans person to hate me, I don't fear or hate trans people. I feel love & empathy, and always want to help. How can I help if I'm called a bitch for merely suggesting our experiences of womanhood are different? Just different, not better or worse, or more or less. Just different/diverse/varied.   I keep endeavoring to hone my own dialogue because I respect the fact the trans community is so attacked by cis-folks that defensiveness is wholly understandable. I'm not angry, I just want to get better at communicating.   Work like yours helps me do that, and I'm so friggin' grateful you exist and chose to do what you do.

"You could also go with a trans-inclusive Marxist feminist response that boiling down womanhood to a singular aspect that not even all cis women go through is an issue for the following reasons:   The predominant feminism appropriating reactionary transphobe's view on womanhood boils it down to bleeding and childbirth, which cis women born without a uterus, that have severe PCOS, or simply don't want children, either don't experience or don't experience in the same way. There's also the addition that the predominant view on biological sex is one inherited from the west, and isn't reflected in indigenous cultures across the world, therefore applying a cultural idea about womanhood is racist and western chauvinist, in that it assumes that the conservative western idea of womanhood is the only correct one, and colonialist, in that it applies this to everyone irrespective of culture. There's also economic class differences, in that a rich white woman is not going to experience womanhood and femininity the same way as a poor black or native woman, and to argue otherwise is either ignorant or just plan intellectually lazy.   As far as abolishing gender, my perspective on it is that it's less make everyone genderless monks on a cloud like some weird cross of the fifth element and bill and Ted in heaven, and more about abolishing gender and heterosexuality as a political construct, and eliminate its influence on social life. This wouldn't harm us trans, but would rather free us up from having ever been considered men or otherwise in the first place. This is what women's liberation truly is: to abolish class distinctions between men and women as a class. In a patriarchal society, men are the ruling class and women are united only in the experience of being oppressed by men. When you abolish gender, you abolish the class distinctions between men and women, and the social expectations of both. You can say it's utopian, but just as a socialist society is capable of abolishing economic class distinctions, it is also theoretically possible to abolish class distinctions between men and women as well.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thank you for this. Being friends with trans people and learning more through the internet really has made me think a lot about gender. I've thought about some of these questions before myself, and I really appreciate your answers.  Though, interestingly, most of the time the questions in my head are directed towards myself. Being a cis woman, I've asked myself many times, what makes me a woman? To me I've just been thinking that I've got the organs I've been born with and I don't mind them, therefore I'm cis. I had never really thought about what gender and womanhood beyond that means to me. And honestly, I'm still not sure.   Or, well, I guess I know what being a woman in this society means, but my utopistic brain just thinks what it _should_ mean. Because I don't want to be defined by my vagina by anyone in any way, I don't want it to matter. But I recognize that it does, and it's probably not going to change, and that all people experience these things and life very differently. Shit's damn complex, all I gotta say.

"This is Frances Smith using her brother's registration - this is only the second comment I have made on You Tube, but I think my brother might renew his offer of setting up an account for me (especially if I say something untoward).  Firstly, thank you for your output. I was ignorant of transgender issues and love your humorous and thoughtful contributions to the debate.  Many of the anti-trans arguments you outline I have made in the past (e.g. they are perpetuating gender stereotypes; why can't people play with gender and start to dissolve the differences; in some cases - white male privilege taking over more and more spaces; you can't feel what it is like to be female because you haven't experienced it from childhood; and so on).  When I was in my teens and twenties I was often criticised for not being feminine (mostly by men) and it would infuriate me.  I never wanted to be feminine (as defined and expected by society), but I didn't want to be thought of as having masculine traits either. I have read several of Germaine Greer's books and have found her ideas to be thought provoking. Of course, Germaine has been a hate figure for many feminists over the years (her book Sex and Destiny was particularly reviled), so she cannot be regarded as representative of all feminists (academic or otherwise). I agree with you that disgust plays a large part in the hatred of trans-people (as it does in many prejudices).  I am black, female, working class, English, and vegan. Only one of these categories has been self-identified (vegan), all the others have been conferred upon me by the society in which I live. (The English tag is problematic for some UK residents, who feel to be English is to be white despite there being a black presence in Britain for hundreds of years.)  I don't mind being called any of these things, but haven't thus far felt that I want to be a cheerleader for any one so-called attribute.  I do, however, feel angry when people use these labels to make assumptions about me and my beliefs.  Additionally, I have experienced someone else's disgust with all these categories over the years - the current most prevalent and least contested one being the hatred and disgust of the working class as expressed by the smugocracy that dominates the mediated public spaces in the UK.  Oh - I have had a proper gabfest, and don't expect many people will have the patience to read through it all. Anyway, thank you for being and sharing. I shall continue to watch your shows and to learn from them.  Much love, Frances.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"It's extremely hypocritical for TERFs to call a transperson 'it' while railing against the oppression and dehumanisation of women, considering that by doing so, they are engaging in oppression and dehumanisation. It is not acceptable to try to equalise power by stealing it from others through dehumanisation. And frankly, the descriptions that TERFs use as they talk about transwomen are rather telling. They include the exact same kind of rhetoric used by most bigots: the overt descriptions of 'subpar' physical features, so-called characteristic features that all people of the same group supposedly exhibit, the general scorn and belittling. And the fear of people who are different. These all reveal much more about the speaker than they do about the subject.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Another thing Germaine Greer doesn't even seem to consider is that some cis women also have beards and 'manly features'. It's so strange, for a faction that claims they're trying to fight against gender essentialism, they completely overlook the existence of their fellow sisters who don't conform to what they perceive is biologically feminine.  Between *2 to 20% of women* have some form of polycystic ovary syndrome, which can also result in physiological changes that are generally considered masculine, including growing a beard. And that's just one condition. Certain thyroid conditions can also result in larger statures, etc. etc. and it is possible that the woman Germaine Greer so triumphantly mocks for her hairy knuckles and poorly concealed stubble is a cis woman - and I know multiple cis women (I know multiple cis women you guys), who reading that, would definitely relate to the woman in question.

The old etymology is for smear related to mud which is a slurry of water and dirt. Also, swirl.

Personally though, suffering is not the basis for my womanhood and fetishising my 'suffering' trying to outsuffer others isn't my jam (I don't even think it's good for the people that do do this). So if the bravery of trans women undermines that narrative, that's a good thing.

"Abolishing gender doesn't mean abolishing individuality or now gendered stuff, on the contraty - it's about celebrating it without restricting it because someone's got a ding-dong or a coochie. Hair is just stuff that grows on your head, makeup is just powders and goo, dresses and pants are just fabric sewn together. That's what this 'utopian' idea is all about. In such a world there would be no need for transitioning. Whether you like it or not, present society is slowly coming to this. Maybe not in this form exactly, but eventually it'll be something along the lines.   Feminine visual representation is not the cause of oppression like trans activists ensue, but a symbol of it. So when a woman chooses to present femininely and wear a dress, it's brave, she takes pride in being a woman even though it's dangerous. But when a man does it, it's appropriation of the suffering of an oppressed group of people - basically like blackface. It's pretty reasonable to be offended when people who killed, raped, enslaved and abused you for millenias decide to suddenly dress like you and modify their bodies surgically to pretend they're one of your kind riiight when women started getting some freedom and safety, right when we finnaly can think of ourselves as humans. Coincidence? I don't believe it. You guys didn't want to be a woman in the age of domestic slavery, so you don't get to be one now.   Next, male privilege. Sure, now that you 'live as a woman' you're experiencing the same things as women, no shit Sherlock, welcome to the club I guess. But being born and raised male gives you an advantage in these situations that women don't have: the ability to stand up for yourself, to know your boundaries and defend them, to feel confident and strong enough to push back, to know that you have a right to speak up and use it, the inner confidence, the lack of deep paralyzing primal fear. So even though the same things are happening to you, you're not experiencing them the same way. And kinda going into the next point - you never will. Childhood years are indeed formative, they're a foundation of who we are. It takes decades of therapy to work through childhood traumas no matter how severe, and the result of therapy is not that people are cured of their trauma, but instead just learn how to live and function with it and it's aftermath. No matter how long you live as a woman, the foundation of your personality, the core of your being is male, and there's no amound of being interrupted and enduring catcalls to change that. Also, doesn't being bullied for being a feminine guy enforce the idea of female inferiority in your brain? Just a thought.  Wanna talk about language? Sure. The word menstruator, just like terf, sounds waaayy too much like a slur. First we were called meatholes, then cocksleeves, now menstruators and birthers, fucking fantastic. Only a man would think that that''s okay and there's nothing wrong with that. Now, the word terf is a tautology: there's no such thing as trans inclusionary radical feminist, those two words were forcefully put in front of the term to alienate those who might be curious about radfem. No radfem calls herself a terf unironically.   Here's another thing: radfem is not about bringing people down, mocking or hurting anyone or anything like that. If those are the feelings that this ideology evokes in you doesn't mean that it is it's goal. It's about looking at the root of the problem and looking for a solution to make people's lives better. The words TIMS and TIFs were made up not to mock you, but to better describe our ideology: it'd be weird if we denied that there's even a possibility for a man to become a woman and vice-versa, but still call you trans-WOMEN and trans-MEN. That's all there is to it, those words were not ment to offend anyone, trust me.  Now, about mutilation. What else would you call a destruction of organs and their function? If I say 'I identify as an insect, please remove my kidneys', noone would do that, because I need those for something, and no matter how much I believe in my identity, I shouldn't just be allowed to mutilate myself because of it. I can't ask for my tonsils or appendix to be removed when there's nothing wrong with them either. Don't get me wrong, I could care less about cosmetic things such as voice change operations, boobjobs etc, but HRT and 'sex-confirmation' surgeries seem fucky to me because I also see unfairness in it because if I, a woman with no kids under the age of 30, go to a doctor right now and ask to tie my tubes, I would get a fuck no. But if I do the same and say 'I think I'm male' - piece of cake. That's unfair and plain weird, if you want to completely obliterate some kind of your body function it should be equally difficult or easy for everyone.   Well, maybe radfems aren't the most polite people in the world and they do get their frustrations out in their private spaces sometimes - tough titties, but how about bringing public comments of trans activists about how 'all terfs must be killed and brutalised', how 'trans women are more women than cis', how 'vaginas and periods are fucking gross', how 'lesbians are just vagina fetishists', etc. You're just picking out the worst comments for the sake of your narrative, anyone could do that, that's not a valid arguement. Not accepting trans ideology is not 'transphobia' or animosity, it's just a CONTRAPOINT to the trans activism, an opposing ideology. When I only started getting into radfem, there were no bitter women in the movement who were mocking trans people - all i saw was a critique that transitioning is not the right way to go about things, that the reasons behind such desire is gender stereotypes and oppression, and that there are alternatives. But after years of death, rape and other violence threats and other disgusting things we get for our views, of course there're now women in the movement who say transphobic things, I can't blame them. You have to understand that it's reactional, transphobia is by no means in the core of the movement like you're trying to prove.

"Listening to the last part I couldn't see parallels to the idea that a lot of our convictions are subconscious and not rational (the elephant and its raider, see e.g. D. Kahneman Thinking fast and slow) and is basically based on the DISGUST. These TERFs do not find transpeople aesthetically pleasing, or even disgusting, and make up rational (or 'rational') justifications for their disgust.   Also, it seems to be linked with the morality of chastity (see Righteous mind by J. Haidt) - for these women femininity and its 'pureness' are perceived as sanctity and in their eyes transwomen commit close to sacrilege by putting their (previously) male selves into their pure female space. This may also explain the temperature of many of these reactions. This is not a rational, scientific, critical issue. This is a direct attack on their moral convictions.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The costumes, performance, setting, humor and overall production are outstanding once again, no doubt about that.  I still downvoted the video because in my humble opinion  the argumentative structure is insufficient and to be honest quite embarrassing for someone who was on the path to becoming a professor of philosophy (if I remember correctly).  At the end it becomes clear why your reasoning is as it is: you dismiss all the arguments you have pretended to address for the last 20+ minutes by calling them transphobic and so you dont care if you actually do engage with them. Apart from that, you want to be accepted as a woman and you dont give a shit whether any cis woman is offended by that. Of course it is perfectly fine that you hold and state that opinion, but you then just might say this instead of pretending to engage with the arguments you dismiss as transphobic and dont give a shit about anyway - but doing so would have not given you the room for creating a masterpice of a video in the artistic/entertainment sense, I understand that.    I want to give you some examples of what I mean by not really addressing the concerns:  Point 1 ('Gender Metaphysics' or the question whether gender has an essential biological component (that trans people miss regarding the gender they identify with) - thats what it really is about in my opinion)  Your opinion is basically 'Fuck off, I disagree with you, thats all nonsense'- technically speaking that is addressing the argument but not really intellectually gratifying.   Point 2-3 (displaying gender stereotypes does not make you a woman and transwomen enforce this very stereotypes by displaying them which they should not do)  You are basically saying 'I cannot overthrow gender stereotypes on my own, so I will use them to establish my womanhood in society as it is and you cannot ask more from me than from a cis woman  while a lot of them also display (and thus reinforce) these stereotypes'. The problem with this is, when it comes to a cis-woman, no one doubts that they are a woman. Even if they dont display female gender stereotypes, they will at worst be mocked and called names, but it will not seriously be doubted that they are a woman. Thus, if they display gender stereotypes, it does not imply that these gender stereotypes are what make them a woman. However, the only things that distinguishes a man from a transwoman are the transwoman's identification with the female gender (which is invisible) and the display of  female gender stereotypes. So, the only thing VISIBLE TO OTHER PEOPLE that distinguishes a man from a transwoman is the transwoman's display of female gender stereoptypes and that might give an observer the idea that what makes you a woman is displaying female gender stereotypes. And thus one could argue a transwoman displaying female gender stereotypes does more harm in this respect than a cis woman doing that.    Point 4-6 (a male born person doesnt understand the struggles of a female born person)  Well you set your experiences of discrimination as a transwoman next to the experiences of discrimination as cis-women and then say there should be no competition who is suffering the most - it was not until you made it that. Surely, being a woman is not mainly defined by suffering but it is about really knowing what you are talking about when it comes to being a woman, in post-modernist terms the 'experience' of being a woman. This is not the only factor defining a woman but it is one of them, that - as you acknowlwdge - trans women are at least partially lacking.   Point 8 ('TERF' as a slur)  I agree that 'TERF' is not slur, but for other reasons. To me, 'TERF' is just an acronym for Trans Exclusive Radical Feminist and I think this is a fairly accurate or at least acceptable description of this position. However, I disagree with your approach that they deserve to be called a derogative name because their entire position boils down to transphobia. I agree that there is one central point behind all of this, but I would not call it Transphobia. The point is 'drumroll pelase' , does a male born person who identifies as female psychologically and displays outer characteristics of a female/'femal gender stereotypes' have the right to call themselves a women and demands others to address and accept them as a woman while they lack almost any other factor that one might consider the essential factors for making woman a woman (e.g. being biologically female, being socialized as a woman, having a female reproductive anatomy with all the strains and demands that come with it, from society as well as individual males etc). I think if you say everyone who hesitates to confirm this fully without hesitation is a transphobic bigot you are making it quite easy for yourself.   I would like to help you to get some empathy for the ,,TERFs'. From their perspective, being a woman is stronly determined by the discrimination women face and society's as well as individual males' pressure to conform to female gender stereotypes regarding beauty, motherhood, being sexually available for men, but noch too much (slut) and other shit. Displaying female gender stereotypes is the last thing they want to accept as a main identifying factor for being female. Then along comes a male born person that identitifies as a female and uses female gender stereotypes to be accepted as a female by patriarchal society, but lacks almost all characteristics that make a woman a woman from the 'TERF' perspective. For them, this is like Rachel Dolzal identifying as black, its like a fully abled person identifying as disabled and using a wheelchair because they think this will make society accept them as disabled. From a 'Terf's' perspective, it is a cruel joke and one of the kind that is definitely not funny. If you want to call that transphobic, then this is an opinion you are entitled to have.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Not a TERF here but my mom has said some pretty TERFy things to me and I think I understand where some of it is coming from. Her concerns about trans people is wanting to set a threshold where someone is 'trans enough' to have a right to that genders spaces. I think that comes from wanting to protect those spaces from trolls who say shit like 'I identify as an attack helicopter' and would sneak into womens spaces for the lols. She also pushes pretty hard for the idea that gender roles have nothing to do with sex but uses that to invalidate me as a nonbinary person because I should just be happy and use my 'women-ness' to do and wear anything because nothing is stopping me from doing so. I dont even really know where to start with these. I think the first one is just plain ignorant and if she saw how that gate keeping hurts trans people she'd knock it off but I dont know how to tell her that womanhood is confining and its especially confining when almost every aspect of it is not who you are.

I may not fit into the whole gender system, even nonbinary genders aren't a perfect fit, but I would still hope that I can be myself, genderless and with a neutral gender expression, and still be just as human as everyone else...

"I feel like I'm really on the opposite side of the gender critical feminists, even though I'm very 'gender critical' myself, but in a way similar to you when you said 'non-orthodox trans person'. I'm kinda like a trans inclusionary Skeptic(tm). I don't believe gender 'exists', i.e. that it is a mechanism that explains how reality works (you know scientifically speaking). I believe gender is an epi-phenomenon. It's like the quote you cited: 'Anybody who identifies as a woman, wants to be a woman, *is going around being a woman*, (...) is a woman.' You know on the one hand it's kinda tautological. Someone who *isn't* a woman can't go around *being* a woman, grammatically speaking. You said, you are going to trust 'every social interaction I've had for months' and this is exactly what you and everybody else should do. This is really what gender means, I believe. And this is my problem with non-binary et al. folks. I mean they are not invalid as persons, but I think their believes about themselves are erroneous. It's like religious people. Probably gender non-conforming is really the best way to put it. From there on I could go on endlessly about how 'they' won't and can't be a genderless pronoun but I'm not gonna annoy y'all with that.  And in fact etymologically speaking every woman necessairily has a uterus. A woman is literally a womb-man (with man as in hu-man, but this is just a coincidence so forget that... And it really doesn't matter anyway.)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Honestly, it is so discouraging to see the hate trans women get, especially when it is about being too feminine or too masculine. It is a struggle that I cannot understand as a cis woman, but I can still empathize. I've always been told to wear makeup and so on, people have tried to make me fit their mold of femininity. That, however, isn't a reason for me to dislike women - trans or otherwise - who embrace the more feminine traits of womanhood. Who am I to judge or take away another woman's expression of womanhood? I find that trans women, rather than conforming to what girls are groomed into thinking of as womanly, as feminine, as womanhood, have their own expression of womanhood - and it is especially evident in how they are being flagged for being too much or too little. Society is still trying to control another woman's body, looks and way of life. Do I still have moments of 'why are they so feminine'? Yes, I do, but then I take a hot second and just... think that they are allowed to express their womanhood, their femininity, just as they want. (Granted, I have the same reaction to feminine women like the Kardashians like you mentioned in your video). But no two women experience their gender the same way, and that is fine. I am also learning to reclaim my femininity, and expressing my own identity not in spite of what I was told I was supposed to be, but because I want. We should all stand together in solidarity. Trans or cis, masc or fem, a woman is still a woman.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i'm a butch nonbinary lesbian & i agree with your video here. i can't speak for all butches, but we get very jaded sometimes and i think that may influence the side-eye you get from cis butch women. we're frequently also pushed out of 'women's spaces' many of us are familiar with security being called on us when we go to the women's bathroom, and in trans spaces many feminine presenting people who do not identify as a woman whatsoever often get put before us when it comes around to asking about the experiences of women in the group.   honestly i know other trans and nonbinary butches (2 the rest of the audience, yes there are butch trans women and they are equally valid women) who even within trans spaces, make people uncomfortable with our vehement rejection of femininity yet assertive claim to lesbianism. In modern lesbian spaces, butches are rare and it's actually very hard to find someone who genuinely wants to date you as a butch - most spaces these days are femme4femme and when i'm on tinder, i always end up matching with other butches where we lament how we barely get anybody willing to talk to us. trans or cis, even within lesbian communities we get treated as 'failed women', and i feel like some butches then go on to internalize that resentment and direct it at trans women for being, in their eyes, let in only for their feminine presentation.   ultimately while the woman=feminine view of many spaces (even feminist/trans ones) are frustrating - i've never personally felt the need to direct this resentment at feminine trans women. we're all fighting our own battles here & society doesn't like trans women existing as much as it doesn't like butch lesbians existing. it's not y'all performing femininity which is the problem, you're just doing your best to survive in a system which treats non-feminine women as gender failures.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I want to thank you for making this video. As a not-always-gender-conforming cis woman (a.k.a. I don't like dresses, make-up and fingernails, but I have long hair and don't try to be particularly masculine either), I had exactly some of these concerns, but was struggling to put them into words because I already understood at least enough to know it could hurt people and didn't want to ask questions that make me sound like a troll.  Since watching your videos, even before you did this one, I have started to understand that trans women's existence doesn't erase issues like menstruation, pregnancy or fgm as female issues and it took me a while to wrap my head around it, but there was still a lingering doubt, because it still all seemed so contradictory to  -which it really doesn't feel like anymore, but still was a thing.  Before this video, to me it was always there, kind of implied already, by all the subtext when you talk about other topics. Now I have it black on white. Thanks for that.  (I was introduced to the online trans discussion two years ago in a very unfortunate turn of events by Magdalen Berns, a terf and Blaire White which wasn't helpful to actually understand trans people)  I still think outward gender performance is a lot of masquerading and I don't like playing in that game of looking the right way which is obviously exactly why terfs are wrong, because they play that game.  Even if I feel like I'm totally above dressing up, I'm still obsessed with my weight, obsessed with chocolate and binging tv shows. And I still demand a say in deciding what's ridiculous. Am I bigoted enough yet?  Lastly, I'm fascinated by your costumes and I see how much work goes into it, so don't take this as a criticism but rather an expression of my personal taste: I watch your videos despite their aesthetics, not because of them, cuz I'm like one of those gamers who always runs around in shapeless, comfy clothing. Watching people wear costumes that certainly don't allow for a relaxed posture alone makes me feel uncomfortable, because I wouldn't want to wear that myself.

"This is so wrong.., what you're saying is wrong. I'm a gender critical gay guy because I believe in sex based oppression and homosexuality being based off sex. Trans activism just doesn't compliment homosexuality and same sex attraction (LGB). I support people with body dysphoria changing their bodies in ways that make their lives more comfortable, but I am wildly against erasing the meaning of female and replacing it with completely identity based definitions, particularly while females continue to be oppressed on that axis. I also don't agree with the perceptions some trans activists have on homosexuality. Sorry, but the LGBT just isn't working out atm.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Sorry for the long comment.   Honest attempt at a real question here. You mentioned that the 'lizard brain' is responsible for the natural intuition of disgust and rejection of homosexuality and trans behavior in general. However, even though it was not explicit, you hinted at this behavior as being wrong, meaning that it should change if you want to become a better person. It is important to mention that I do agree that these impulses can be put in check by conscious effort in order to reduce effective harm I.e. adherence to a certain code of conduct as to minimize externalities caused by social interaction. On the other hand, even with the intended construction of this 'structure' to prevent wrong doing, the internal intuition will, most likely, still be present.    Given that I never seen you talk about moral frameworks, then my questions are:    Why is the man with the 'lizard' intuition wrong? Is he only evil if he acts on it? Is there such a thing as 'good' at all?   It seems to me that we can at least rule out a couple theories like moral intuitionism (or most forms of non-cognitivism). Some Theistic systems at least try to argue that some human intuitions are evil and should be controlled by something greater, but still falls short as a possible moral framework for you because of obvious reasons. I do not know how one can classify others as acting rightly or wrongly (good or evil, etc.) without having a proper consistent system to represent moral matters. Also, are you assuming or presupposing freewill and volition when suggesting we should act differently than our initial intuitions? Is that assumption in conflict with other things you argue for?   Thanks for the attention if you had the patience to read the full thing!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Thank you so much for making this video.  The painful, often unheard truth is that there is a significant subset of radical feminism that on some level just doesn't like men, or even hates us. For all the reactionary whinging about misandry and demonization of boys, there are *some* spheres where you'll (read: I have) run into genuine gut-level distrust from feminist activists. I think it's understandable to hate a group of people that has demonstrably wronged you, but I don't think it ultimately makes things better. I try to be mindful of the reasons why someone might distrust me 'just' for being a man, but it gets difficult to keep my cool because I'm not made out of stone either and that shit hurts me. Indirectly having this issue acknowledged feels like a relief.  PS: I got wrapped up in my own thoughts and forgot to comment on the video in general! It's yet another banger! I keep learning more about trans issues from you, and the way you engage in polemics is inspiring as a testament to the power of self-aware projected confidence with impeccable presentation.

"I recently had a conversation with a trans friend of mine. I was trying to understand the process of transitioning, but was met with exactly this 'I was always a man. Nothing's changing.' rhetoric. And it's not like he owes me an explanation. It's not like I think of him as a woman. Still, I've known him for 10 years, and... I lack the language to conceptualize what's been happening for the last 2-3 years. And while it doesn't really change my experience of him, I think the lack of vocabulary, and a deeper understanding of... eh, 'the process'? I don't even know how I'm supposed to talk about it. Anyways I feel that the lack of that vocabulary and understanding, it also makes conversations with transphobes more difficult.  Like every attempt at describing my bystander experience was refuted, so I'm now speaking in such abstract terms that it's completely disconnected from anything that happens in reality. I hesitate to even describe what I'm struggling to comprehend. I'm relatively privileged myself, so I can have these conversations with people whereas my trans friends can't, but I don't feel sufficiently armed with the necessary vocabulary :/  Also, just to be clear, my inability to understand what is happening doesn't mean that someone's experience isn't real, and I accept that. I'm simply trying to figure out if I could have a better understanding.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There is something to be said about trans women who are a bit 'aggressive' in their pursuit of femininity.  Early in my transition I visited a mixed trans support group. The women there were all at least 15 to 20 years or more older than me, the guys were all about my age. Things that were said to me there: - 'women don't curse, you should watch your language' - 'give it a year or so on hormones, you'll love dresses, makeup, heels, nails' - 'girls don't play video games' and some other bullshit. I don't go that group anymore. My mom, who needed some time to really accept my transitioning (props to her for doing most of that work on her own), was more supportive.

"That point at the end is essential and one I hear very rarely. People often act like homophobia or transphobia come from some kind of religious source pushed upon the masses, but they're pretty much equally present across all, or almost all, cultures worldwide.   People don't learn to hate gay people because they read the Bible and it said it was a sin. They have a gutteral disgust reaction to it and then use the Bible as a sort of justification for it. It gives them a flimsy crutch to cling to those beliefs, but it didn't make them up. Same with transphobia.

"I have a strong preference that instead of TERF (Trans Exclusive Radical Feminist), the term FART (Feminism Appropriating Reactionary Transphobe) be used instead. It signifies that such a hateful ideology is unwelcome amongst feminists.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"When I encountered the term 'gender critical' for the first time and didn't know yet that it was a euphemism for 'TERF', I actually liked it a lot and thought 'this sounds like it describes my stance on gender'. (I pretty much think that gender is a social construct that will pretty much lose its importance at some point and we'll stop seeing people as their gender and treating them in a way that's gender specific, and biological sex will only be relevant in medical context and it won't influence society's treatment of a person at all. This may be a utopian fantasy, since i'm not totally sure this is gonna happen, but i sure hope it will. But that's my perspective as a person who finds gender restrictive to me personally and who doesn't identify as any gender at all. And I don't think attacking trans people for conforming to gender stereotypes too much is the way to 'abolish gender', I think using gender-neutral language when talking about many people at once (like 'pregnant people' instead of 'pregnant women', as mentioned in the video) is a lot more effective and less harmful in that regard.)  Anyway, I find it pretty sad that the term 'gender critical' has been claimed by TERFs as a euphemism for their transphobic ideology when it could be used to describe a discussion on the nature of gender that explores the concept in many different ways, instead of just saying 'gender was invented by PC cultural marxist soyboy cucks, and chromosomes are the only thing that determines in which one of the rigid boxes that I've constructed someone fits'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thank you so much for this video! As someone who entertained some terf-lite ideas for a while, it's nice to see these questions given an honest rebuttal, even if they're usually asked in bad faith as a dismissive tactic. Your videos in general have been hugely instrumental in changing me from a 'gender-critical' fence-sitter, to a trans-ally, and I cannot thank you enough.    Also, I have no idea why people on Twitter give you such a hard time. Everyone's experience with identity is unique, probably doubly so for people navigating the minefield that is gender (I'm questioning mine at the moment, and boy is it a trip). Not to mention the idea that any one trans person should be 'representing the whole community' is silly to me. I mean, I'm bisexual and I'm also polyamorous. And it took me a long time to accept that my multiple partners was not 'reflecting badly on the community' or 'perpetuating stereotypes about bisexuals' and I hate seeing this divisive 'but you make us look bad!!!' argument cropping up in other places too. Respectability politics are garbage, no matter where they strike, and I'm also glad that you don't seem to care about them in the slightest.   tl;dr: You're awesome!

TERFy questions that were mostly covered in this video, but they were questions that I desperately did not have good answers to. And how am I supposed to be on the same side as trans people if I can't even defend my POV to an anti-trans person?   But everytime another swirling question gets answered, the separation that I feel between myself and people in the trans comm. shrinks just the tiniest bit. The guilt in my heart shrinks just a little bit, when I come  to terms that I'm not truly a hateful person, but I am just as susceptible to hateful ideas, if I don't put in the effort to counter them with better and more nuanced ones.

"Hi Natalie, I really love your videos (btw you are absolutely gorgeous <3), and agreed with most of the things you said in this one, except for one little thing. As a transmedicalist and a trans guy, your comment about transmedicalism really stuck out to me. Most transmedicalists don't believe that you have to hate yourself to be trans. Dysphoria is just feeling a disconnection from your birth sex and the discomfort that it causes. That's it. You don't have to suffer immensely every day to have dysphoria. For some people, dysphoria is just knowing that they are not the gender they were assigned at birth, and being frustrated when people treat them as their biological sex. There are nonbinary transmeds, gnc transmeds and transmeds who feel very minor dysphoria. I myself am pretty lucky, and only feel mild to moderate dysphoria most of the time (although I do have days when it's really bad). I believe nonbinary transpeople, gnc trans people and trans people with mild dysphoria are valid, and so do many other transmeds. Granted, there are transmedicalists who are the way you view us, but they are definitely not the majority, and many members of our community actually speak out against them. Btw this isn't to hate you or anything, as I said, I enjoy your videos and respect you as a person!

That would be like getting mugged by a black guy and in response organizing a campaign to get the government to refuse to recognize a Native American tribe because....minorities?  Although I do admit to playing it fast a lose with my numbers and power dynamics the point of this example was that I don't see how your man phobic woman could have arrived at her conclusion in an emotional way without one or two fairly bigoted base assumptions that caused her to conflate men with trans women.  Additionally I think you might might have accidentaly drawn a false moral equivalency between the kind of mostly unintentional microaggressiony avoidance behaviors directed at men (a group that is generally too powerful politically and prevalent numerically to feel the gaze of undisierablity from our 'gender sceptic' friend) with deliberate political activism aimed at stripping trans people (I don't think it's an accident that trans men get caught in the crossfire) of the precious few rights they have.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I would also add that detransitioned women who fall into TERF ideology often use their experiences to claim that trans men are wrong in transitioning. I kind of understand why you didn't talk about detransitioned people, but I feel like some TERFS will watch this video and point to detransitioners, saying 'this is what the dogmatic transgender movement doesn't want you to know about.'  I also would love to hear a more in-depth critique of transmedicalism, because I think a lot of young trans people, trans guys in particular, are leaning towards that belief, including myself. I haven't really heard any good arguments against the belief that you need to be uncomfortable with your assigned sex (have dysphoria) to be trans.

"around 11 minutes there's the whole 'abolishing gender' thing - it doesn't mean you erase gender signifiers and everybody expresses themselves the same. I have never met any radfems who want that. What they mean is abolishing the whole system of labelling things as being gendered. A world where skirts are just a piece of clothing you wear if you find them comfy and like the look, with no connection to women or concepts like 'femininity'. In a way I think that sounds like a great world to live in, one where nobody is pressured to conform to anything. I don't think that's a bad world to want, the problem is that radfems don't have a clear plan for getting to that utopia. We are so deeply embedded in cultural ideas about gender that it's hard to imagine how we'd break those conceptual connections. In fact, it's probably gender non-conforming people who are doing more to break that connection, if only through getting people used to being around people whose signifiers don't connect to their sex and/or gender like they're 'supposed to'. So it's hypocritical for radfems to attack trans people for conforming to gender expressions.. they have no way of knowing what expressions are authentic or not and no process for making society more free in that regard. And as she points out in the video - why are they so focused on attacking trans people for their conformity? Why not attack the people with power who promote and punish others according to how much they conform? How about the men who assault people for not conforming?

"I'M HOWLING I'm super guilty of the genderless wishful thinking, but I'm thinking more of a world where you can wear fake nails without the 'you-are-female' implication -because that's a social construct, right? I would love to live in a society where you can dress and present based on what you like, without worrying about fitting into a binary/non-binary stereotype (I've noticed that even some non-binary people are gatekeeping eachother nowadays... Isn't it pointless then?)  Anyway, I would never use the argument to put down a trans person, it makes no sense. Saying that you want a gender-free world and then criticizing someone for the way they dress (too masculine/too feminine?!) kinda debunks the whole argument. If self-expression is gender-free, then clothes have no gender, make-up has no gender, GENDER HAS NO GENDER, gender isn't real but that doesn't invalidate trans people... No more than it invalidates cis people. Idk, maybe it's a stupid idea.   I LOVE your videos, oh my god (and your looks are the coolest)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The thing about the whole TERF thing is that it does follow from some basic feminist ideas. Feminists have vigorously denied any sexual dimorphism in the brain's morphology. Men and women act, dress, relate to one another and each other, etc. because of conditioning/expectation, not because of any innate differences per the Damore memo thing. Well, if you think that, then if you are born with a cock and balls, raised/socialized as a boy, in what sense can being a guy be 'wrong for you'? To understand that, we have to resort to the sexed brain to understand why that identity is dissonant with your inner self.

"5:47 Trans people don't like engaging those questions because they expose the flaws with trans ideology. Why not answer the question... why CAN'T you just be a feminine man? Why does your appreciation of things that fall within female stereotypes mean you should be counted as a woman? Why are you defining womanhood by stereotypes?  This stuff is offensive to women. It's the equivalent of 'I like basketball and rap and fried chicken, therefore I am black.' Can you even imagine a black person being accused of hate speech for saying 'uh no Mr. White Person, fitting into black stereotypes doesn't make you black'? It's ridiculous... but it's exactly what happens when women say that dresses and long hair and makeup don't turn a man into a woman.  In response to other points... you seem to be misunderstanding some other GC viewpoints.  Gender critical people believe the following: 1) anyone should be able to dress however the hell they want to 2) anyone should be able to modify their appearance surgically or however else they want to 3) being female is not about how you were socialized, it's about your biology.  GC feminists aren't criticizing your choice to wear makeup and dresses, we're criticizing the idea that wanting to wear those things means you must be a woman. GC people want men to be able to break stereotypes and live their lives however they want to... just stop saying that breaking the stereotypes makes you female, and stop demanding access to sex-segregated places like women's locker rooms and women's sports leagues and women's prison. They are segregated by biological sex for a reason, they are not segregated by personality stereotypes.  GC feminists want lesbians  to be free to date only females, without being shamed if they don't want to date someone who has a 'lady dick'.  GC feminists are often accused of 'gatekeeping'. Technically this might be true, but that doesn't mean it's wrong. Many people were 'gatekeeping' when they told Rachel Dolezal she isn't black. People will rightfully 'gatekeep' an adult who claims to be a child and wants to attend elementary school. There is nothing wrong with refusing to agree with someone's claim about their identity that is physically demonstrably a false claim.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It really undermines your claim to authority when u use discredited terms. 'TERF' is a canard & a term of abuse. It is used as a stick to beat down anyone sayin anything even remotely divergent from whatever the current favoured trans theory of the day happens to be. WPUK get called 'TERF' even tho real live transpeople go to their meetings and support their message. And even 'extreme' feminists like Greer are inclusive of transmen in women's spaces. So they are not 'trans exclusionary'. At best you could call some of those people 'PERFS'. I think you know what the 'P' stands for.  You know, just cos you say a thing whilst making a squinty face, doesn't make it invalid. 'gender critical' just means you don't place 'gender' as the central and most vital aspect of human identity and existence. It means you don't believe in immutable gender expression. That's actually totally progressive. They do believe in physical reality tho, which is why they dont think males should be allowed to compete against females in sports for example. The 7ft 'female' basketball player being an obvious example of why.   You say don't want to parody 'terfs' and then go ahead and parody 'terfs'... I r confuse.  Theres reasons theres a huuuge disparity between the number of transwomen and transmen. Its a psychosocial ting yo   You don't 'live as a woman', you live as a man who likes to try and look like a woman. Your mental gymnastics on that point lead nowhere.  The gender critical women you are so repulsed by do not want to curtail your rights or ability to present or feel as you wish, they just want to preserve the concept of facts. So when things like all-women short lists are implemented to redress an imbalance between male and females in a particular arena, then its fair and logical for those shortlists to be compiled of women, not anyone who says they are since last Tuesday.  Its no coincidence that 'trans' has exploded exponentially of late. Gender stereotypes have become entrenched. Back in the 70s & 80s it was more fluid, men had flowing locks and wore makeup, women had shaved heads and wore dungarees.. In a society that is more open to free expression there seems to be less incentive for the gender disenfranchised to seek a more severe solution to their frame of mind.

"Just thought I'd drag my degenerate post-dimorphic-sex post-human simultaneous-hermaphrodite cyborg furry tyranny in on my feet with me and shit things up a bit with entirely speculative cartoon science-fiction fantasy removed 'totally' from reality... totally.  *whistle of faux innocence*  Say--what if--tweak a few chromosomes with nanites and make some new tissues and organs in vivo--and *bam it iddn't a woman no more.* (oh did I invoke biology thar)  One problem is, as with most issues of value, that we as humans find ourselves falling into a trap of determinism vs. free will, and nature vs. artifice, when debating topics of identity.  Like, am I 'choosing' right now to represent myself as a neon-furred space-alien, that flirts with purple headcrabs, or is that simply a product of nature/nurture? Is it 'healthy' for such a seemingly extreme deviation from the human norm to exist, or is it something that should be treated like an illness and corrected for the sake of some form of ethical humane treatment?  The way I see it, I am a mutation of the human species, that could succeed or fail all on its own, but I would prefer to succeed, for the sake of novelty, and for the sake of my own prosperity. I find the current human norm boring, albeit practical (product of aeons of evolution, yada yada), but find myself attracted to imagining the strange and different. I'd prefer to 'become' just about anything if I could somehow have the experience of that, with the assurance of a complete refund (impractical as that wishful thinking may be), but simultaneously accept that physical bodies have limitations and health concerns, and that to just up and Franken-Fran myself into whatever I desire through a combination of gene editing, nanobiology, and cosmetic surgery, is not a presently tenable solution to my existential curiosity and yearning to show off a weird pastiche of androgynous interspecies beauty with intact reproductive function and the power to filthily self myself like a horny pea plant.  Ultimately, I think the matter of 'trans' comes down to weighing the compromise of what is physically and psychologically healthy and consistent for the individual, against what they would ultimately desire as a goal of self-actualization, and creating a model for that self-actualization that interferes minimally with the existing social orders of the human species. As our technology improves, and our medical ethics evolve, these will be questions that are altogether redefined, as the range of options available to humans to redefine their identity expands and becomes more readily available to the layman.  A couple decades ago, you didn't have things like video games, 'avatars', and the internet, allowing people to experiment so freely with their sense of identity and capability to affect a world.  Something to consider. Just a tiny slice of what a couple decades of progress with computers have offered us--virtual identity redefinition--a child sandbox's taste of the construction projects to come... bleh, sandy.

"'-rather we're using a cultural language of feminine signifiers to prompt others to see us for what we are.'   I think you meant to say that you use a cultural language of feminine signifiers to help *yourself* in deterring from the idea that you could be perceived as masculine. The great unfair irony here being that so much effort/resources are required of you just in maintaining a visual perception when that poor undergrad armed with only a hair-tie, an old hoodie, and some flip-flops makes it seem like she's cheating in terms of no one disputing her 'presentation'.   'i'm tempted to strike back to say you don't know what it's like...- [blah blah blah?]'   i think the 'forest through the trees' point to be made here is that the real juicy bits and the actual injustice part of oppression is that most of us don't spend hundreds of dollars to gain it.    My quip here (assuming anyone cares) is the dismissal of 'I want to be a woman' for 'I am a woman'. It brings to mind the 'Any man who must say, 'I am the King', is no true king.' line. The whole point of commonly being established as genuine is that it does little to inspire doubt and even less to call for convincing. It's effortless in its presentation because it simply is. The root of respecting others identities, how we treat them, and how we address them is where most of the ills lie.  But since I'm already this far into the textbox I'm going to whip out a very broad brush. One I'm ashamed enough to mention beforehand but not so ashamed as to refrain from using it; Looking at this from a distance, genuine dysphoria aside, it's just another remix of that old ass song where a white dude does everything in his power to get what he wants.

"I read a thing once, where a woman talked about how they had told their mother that they felt bad that they'd had a knee jerk sexist reaction towards another woman, and that their mother told them that the knee jerk reaction isn't what matters, because that's just what society tells us to think. The thing that really mattered was the thought afterwards, the acknowledgment that she was wrong. And that really stuck with me. A big thing about bigotry is that it's based on the knee jerk reaction of disgust, and it then goes unexamined. When I first realized I was a part of the lgbt+ community, I had to examine a lot of my knee jerk reactions to other members, and that was difficult. Sometimes I still find myself uncomfortable around the topic of trans people, because it's foreign to me, and the majority of my knowledge comes from a primarily cis media. But the trick is catching your knee jerk reactions, and working towards educating yourself on the topic. I'm still in that process, and I probably always will be. But I'm never going to let that reaction control me, because I know it's wrong, and it is fallible, and taking a moment to sit with it and then work to better myself is infinitely better than pushing my own issues onto someone else just because I'm uncomfortable. And my life has gotten infinitely better since I started living that way, and ContraPoints has been a huge part of that learning process.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

You are spot on in the reason it it necessary to have people fall into either male or female identities! Without knowing who is a woman and who is a man, they are what? just they? or more typical is the case that you so perfectly showed us in this video 'they' are just a robot! Besides, won't that be really confusing since there are not public bathroom or locker rooms for robots to use since Duh! robots don't use bathrooms or locker rooms! (and robots dont even go to the gym or the pool or anywhere else for that matter!) Only human people go to school, the gym, the mall, the library, the grocery store, only humans not robots do that stuff!  Yes I have seen maybe 1 or 2 public bathrooms that were labeled as UNISEX but they were only at a doctors office, one was upstairs and the other was downstairs, and besides it didn't say non-gendered on the sign on the door. And how many places will actually install a woman's room, a men's room and a Unisex room? (obviously it is more expensive to have 3 bathrooms than 2!)  So the next time you are out & about of the house, take notice of the bathrooms at the place, any place that you go to. What bathrooms do you see? It's not that complicated! Giving people the options of being a human man or a human woman has some very very useful & necessary & practical reasons. The bathrooms & locker rooms are just one small one (also add the fitting rooms in any stores that sell human clothing too!)   ","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Your remark about 'gender critical' being similar to 'race realist' in that it seeks to ameliorate perceptions of prejudiced beliefs is brilliantly incisive.  Something I find curious about a lot of TERFs is that their bigotry isn't usually a signifier of their wider beliefs. You can expect a typical MRA to be pro-life, pro-gun and xenophobic. But TERFs tend to have a lot of liberal bona fides (here in the UK, some of the most prominent TERFs write for left leaning newspapers). So they seem to find it hard to recognise their transphobia as an act of bigotry.  I once had an argument with a columnist for the New Statesman who was supporting the bathroom bills in America on the basis that allowing trans women into female spaces would be to invite potential abusers into them. I pointed out that this was almost identical to the logic of racists who claim that allowing Muslim refugees into European countries will lead to an increase of sex crimes.  She was so insulted that I'd compared her to racists that she blocked me, which I found quite instructive - she thought of herself as a morally good person and couldn't accept the parallel between her behaviour and something as repugnant as racism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hi! Ex 'gender critical' person here (aka ex-stupid terf). You wanna know why I thought that way? Simple, I was told from an early age certain of my attributes were man like, so I had this irrational fear that I wasn't enough of a woman and I projected those insecurities on transgender people. So whenever you see a TERF pity them, cause from my experience they are a bundle of insecurities that lash down on others to feel better about themselves, do not validate them it's a stance entirely based on emotions and nothing else, no smart dialogue will ever come from it. (Having said that I never bully people on the internet because even as a teenager I had the critical skills necessary to understand that was wrong, so don't pity them that much I guess)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I was really happy to see that you uploaded a video, as I recently found out about your channel and have been binge watching everything. It's very educational and entertaining, as so many other people comment. But then at 4:56 I see the president. I'm not upset to see Trump. I'm talking about the Latin American Trump version that my fellow Brazilians chose to vote for.  Once a great Brazilian writer said that us Brazilians have a stray dog syndrome. We feel as if we are unworthy as if compared to other countries economics and politics (the serious stuff), and yet feel very proud of the rest (football and caipirinhas, I guess?). I don't know if it makes sense for other people but it suits this moment very well for me. I do have to say that seeing even a slight mention of my country on my new favorite channel feels like I'm not being picked last at gym class, yay! But for all the wrong reasons.

I have always did this with MRA's/MGTOW's... drag the conversation to laws and then point out men where the ones that wrote them they will ALWAYS blame woman for not changing them or trying to change them ..ALWAYS and that's your queue: 'You want woman to fight men's battles for them? Are you a feminist bc you sound like one? Your truly ARE emasculated you cucked fuck'  they love to claim they are emasculated but DAMN they hate it when they are called that bc they aren't really...and will more often than not scream how they are not - which ofc destroys their own entire narrative...  debunking videos of fine and good BUT ones that debunk while completely mocking and laughing at their ideas ALWAYS get video replies and angry demands for 'debates' etc they claim to be the meme/internet generation but remember idiots SO ARE WE ...","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"BTW the reason that the vast majority of battle/war fatalities & POVs are male, men, biological guys, is simply cuz the entire military is systemically clearly MORE Accepting of human beings of the MALE gender/sex. Look at the entire recruitment process, when you see a recruitment camp set up outside of the local super save a lot store (or walmart).  1. Notice how many women/females are part of the group trying to get everyday discount seeking American people coming in & out of the store typically they have a small group of uniform clad, Men about 2-4  and 2. they will approach 1.other men and 2.couples, when they speak to a couple that consists of a man & a woman, they typically ask the man about this thoughts or ideas of enlisting in the service. So in conclusion - when you have a system that typically favors recruitment of one group of people over another group of people, that system will recruit the vast majority of the favord group. Look at the data! Do a simple internet search to see how many people were recruited or enlisted into the American military (every branch) and see what gender/sex they are of. It's very obvious.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thank you for this. Years ago I was  a giant TERF & I've made a lot of progress since then but I still had a lot of these thoughts running in the back of my mind. I just decided to stop acting so hateful and respect everyone, but I never managed to figure out the answers to a lot of the questions that TERFs pose.  I'm a very gender non-conforming lesbian & have been through so much at the hands of men. My life experiences made it so easy to be terrified of everyone with a Y chromosome. It felt like the only thing that could keep me safe, because I made so many mistakes and trusted so many men I shouldn't have. It's only this year I let a straight man in my car since I was a teenager. And that's only because I had a knife. Anyone that could possibly have a d*ck was a threat and it would be my fault if something happened to me if I trusted them.   I've also never cared for gender, and get sird often enough it's a pattern, so it was very hard for me to understand why pronouns mattered so much to people. The only part of womanhood I identify with is my body and the way I was victimized at a young age, so I was easy prey to TERF reasoning that the only part of womanhood that mattered was chromosomes & upbringing.   I know it's silly to spill my guts in a YouTube comment, but just in case you see this I wanted you to know you really changed one butch's point of view by explaining all the nuance, and there's plenty of people in bigoted spaces that you can still reach.

"It's not really taken for granted that trans men's experiences as women before we transitioned are valid and that we know what it's like to be women. Yeah, it is sometimes, but I've seen it go both ways. Most people (online) don't treat me any different than a cis guy that doesn't know what he's talking about (irl, I don't pass so idk how that would go), especially in leftist spaces that aren't exclusively for trans people (think leftbook groups and stuff). Some people seem outright hostile even. It really depends on what type of LGBT space you're in. I'm glad that's been your experience with it but it really hasn't been mine. But I definitely agree that whether trans guys are treated this way on the whole or not, that trans women's experiences before they transitioned are often discounted or expected to be a certain way.

"((4K comments, probably not gonna get answered, but who knows))  This isn't a gotcha moment, but it's something that's getting press.  Why haven't you commented on trans women in born women sports events (I'm saying born women as a way to seperate the two for this particular comment, not a way to erase trans at the moment as it would get confusing if I tried saying Women are taking Womens jobs or something).  Because there have been a significant number of Trans Women who have gotten into womens sports and won with significant gaps between them and born women counterparts.  That males tend to on average, have better physiques for various physical activities on a statistics standpoint (not commenting on outliers).  Thus, if someone transitioned late, or not even had full transitioning surgery, would still have various physical masculine aspects that would help in sports (like to be on average taller).    Is it fair for a born woman to lose their competition to at best, a woman with a mans body, or even worse, a bad actor taking advantage of the times and claiming to be a woman?    Because that isn't as clear cut, because we are dealing with biology that cant be retroactively changed, and in several cases, hasn't even been attempted to be changed.

"IMO, if we're taking the direction of accepting new pronouns and gender identities that go beyond the spectrum of masculine-feminine (I'm talking xim/xer/bunself and cloudgender here - if you're not on board with that nonsense then this may not apply) then attempting to abolish gender as a social construct is a better idea and more realistic to accomplish. Either we can build a bunch of new boxes to be upset about being forced into, or we can tear those boxes down. And you know what? All my life I've been watching those boxes slowly crumble - realistically speaking, we'll probably never get away from gendered signifiers and such but I think it's perfectly possible to, maybe in the next 100 years, reach a point where people well and truly have no concern about the appearance and mannerisms of other people and which side of the seesaw those lean on, and maybe then we can just HAVE BATHROOMS and stop worrying about whether it's more likely for someone to break laws in them if they're in the same room with the wrong people. And maybe we can just DATE PEOPLE WE FIND ATTRACTIVE and find some way to navigate genital preference like adults.   That said, the 'gender critical' are out of their minds if they think their desire for the abolition of gender is reason enough to deny trans people their identities now. What a great way to prove they actually don't believe the words that are coming out of their own mouths. When I say I don't think gender is important, I back that up by being a lifelong cis male who doesn't bat an eye when he's misgendered. Like sure, you're wrong, and I might correct you so things don't get awkward, but I'm not going to pretend the whole damn world already plays by my rules. I try to be an example and I make dumb internet comments basically just barking at a wall, but my goal is to shift perceptions and open people to new ideas, not use my own ideals as a whip to abuse others.   in my mind gender is not an identity; it's just a tool. It's not your totality, it's just one of nearly infinitely many ways to describe who and what you are. It's a very generalized tool with a huge spread that hits a lot of people, but our pattern-seeking brains find such taxonomic classifications useful in grouping together individuals of broad similarities. That, to me, is why it seems absurd when people go down the 'bunself' rabbit hole. Because of course your identity is bunny-like. Don't even PRETEND like I don't know how that feels. But my gender is not 'stupid purple raccoon' - that's my identity. I get to define my own name to mean that. My body, my soul, my very essence IS stupid purple raccoon, and nobody but me gets to change that. My pronoun can continue being the broad, only-vaguely-useful-in-a-categorization-sense he/she/they. Because it never has been, and never should be, anything more than that.   But also, that's why it's so stupid to deny someone's identity. Contra is a woman. Look at her. There's no denying that the only way in which she can be considered anything else are her chromosomes/sex organs. And we have a word for that already; it's called sex. If you want to tell me that someone who looks, dresses, acts like, and for all intents and purposes IS a woman, is in fact not a woman, at that point you're twisting the concept of gender into something it is definitively not, all because of your own personal distaste. I don't buy their line of reasoning there.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Your problem isn't with gender critical feminists, your problem is with a class society that has organized people by sex and assigned particular roles and feelings to those sexes. Gender critical feminists don't choose to be defined within the category of 'woman', it's been forced upon them, as it has for all women. You have a major misunderstanding with the way sex functions and how it is deeply connected to a class system that organizes and oppresses people by having female bodies.  We live in a world where people are defined by their bodies. The definitions of people and the organization of power assigned to identities by society comes from the top down. Those are the rules made by men (and whites). The dominant society, globally, for thousands of years, determines womanhood according to being born female with a female genitalia. Again, these are the definitions made by those in power. When you're referring to sex, you're not simply talking about mental and physical female characteristics, you're also talking about a specific class of people that have a specific identity with a specific lived experience. To say that being born in a female body, by the standard definition, isn't a specific and distinct difference from being born male, is to completely misunderstand how sex-ism actually functions in a sex-based society. To be subject to an oppression, the dominant class has to define you as a member of the oppressed group. For example, if I'm 15% black, but my socialization is white, my birth certificate and all following documents say I'm white, and people regard me as white...then I'm white, according to the social and political definitions of race. The same applies to sex.  So again, the definitions aren't being set by gender critical feminists, it's already been predetermined by the dominant class. They're simply pointing it out to you that your identity and experience is different from their identity and experience. To have a problem with that runs counter to your own logic. Biological women acknowledging and defining the terms of their OWN specific identity is not something you have any rightful say in, and to believe otherwise is misogyny.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Welp. Just saw the beginning of the tumblr shitstorm.They're already taking huge chunks of this out of context, basically projecting out and acting like you are talking about their individual lived history, and saying you're racist and ableist. And that you are not framing TERFs as actually spiteful and more 'confused'.  Oh and that you are setting trans people back DECADES with this video bc.......I suppose going through and explaining nuance/exploring complicated things like gender in society and how it is messy is really anti-trans lmao.  Anyway this video is amazing. I think it really points out the flaws in the TERF ideology and dismantles all of their flimsy arguments.

"I don't really like the way this video deals with the argument of gender abolition. You opened the video saying you would engage in these arguments, and instead refused to engage with gender abolitionism because it's used often as a weapon. It's fine to choose not to engage with it, but it feels wrong considering you lead me to believe you were going to actually address its concern.   I see gender as a vehicle that is by definition oppressive. Gender is, at its core, a collection of stereotypes. Now I agree that's no reason to attack trans people, but I'd argue it's not outside the reach of society to move past gender entirely. It's one of those things where it's not something you should throw in people's faces, but it's something you should get people thinking about. If you just say over and over it's utopian and will never happen, then you'll be no better than those who say the same things about socialism. Those aren't good faith arguments.   So in closing, I think gender abolition is a legitimate goal to work toward, and I think gender defined by identity is a step forward towards that goal.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"and honestly as a woman who cant bleed nor get pregnant one has to wonder what the fuck they consider me??? #pcosgang  jokes aside tho gender is a weird issue for me. i was never really allowed to feel any one way as a kid growing up. Women and men just made fun of me for not being feminine enough, often calling me a woMAN (haha get it?? Because MAN??? Emphasis on MAN?? it's funny because it has the word MAN). All the while having to deal with the fact that I hit puberty way earlier than anyone else in my class so having to deal with catcalls in elementary school was fun (and even being dresscoded?? Mulitple times?? Like hello?? At least wait until I'm twelve asshole??)   In middle school I chose to wear basketball shorts and t-shirts for most of my time there. Fashion was hard for me. I didn't always know what I wanted to wear but I knew I wanted to stay away from the more 'feminine' things. This was, of course, my 'im not like other girls' phase to which I'm sure most of you are familiar with. I was uncomfortable with showing off any of my body, and the fatphobia radiating off of everyone around me didn't help with it either.   When I hit freshman year of highschool tho, that was when my feminist ass took off. I wore short shorts and shirts that hung low enough to show off all seven boobs. (That's a joke btw) I embraced my curves. I got dresscoded every week!! I thought I had finally pushed all the taunting and hatred of my childhood behind me. Of course, that itself was just a phase too. I was still silently convinced I looked more 'man-ish' no matter how hard I tried to push the thought down. I wanted to try and experiment with gender expression but my mother was apprehensive at the time. She didn't want me being targeted and ridiculed at school. (Jokes on her tho because I was already targeted lmao ).  Even now I struggle to identify myself. I've been content just calling myself non-binary and/or afab. It's kind of difficult for me to even say that I was born this way because I don't really know. Far be it from me to tell anyone their own experience, but I can't help but have part of me think that I was, for lack of a better term, forced to identify this way. Force is obviously the wrong word; nobody *made* me choose to id as nb. But I do feel as if I wasn't allowed to be anything for so long that my relationship with 'womanhood' is strained if anything at all.  Apologies if this seems scrambled, but it is one in the morning, and I had no idea that I would be writing a novel in the YouTube comments about my childhood traumas.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As an AFAB person with an Adam's Apple, being exposed to TERF rhetoric and the way they talk about trans women as little more than a set of typically-masculine secondary sexual characteristics can also irrevocably damage cis women's relationships with their bodies. I grew up as a woman, was socialized as a woman, and otherwise presented 100% feminine but I'd still get 'clocked' as a man by strangers on the internet. Even now as an Agender person who feels comfortable embracing things that used to make me feel shame, I still hate my neck. I can't imagine how it must feel to be a woman with prominent facial hair or less than delicate features to read the bile they spew.

"another amazing video, natalie! <3   i never saw myself as a TERF but i kno that i definitely feel into a lot of transphobic rhetoric when i was younger-- even just a few years ago. i was definitely that feminist that posted a lot of support for women supporting each other but used slogans like 'uteruses before dude-eruses' and the like. i have always tried to be welcoming to transwomen in feminist spaces, but often forgot about them when impassioned-- and transmen?! i felt they had absolutely no place in feminist spaces as they had, in essence 'given up their woman card'.  it was,,,, not a good look for me. it was a conscious effort for me to start looking into transwomen's lives through documentaries all over the internet. it took me dating a transwoman, watching a good friend move from a woman, to gender-neutral to eventually coming out as a transman. my best fucking friend in the world is a transguy and he still, humbly, calls me out on my bullshit.  should it take that? do i need a trans community babysitter? no, but i appreciate it and i try to support all of my trans brothers and sisters, individually and en mass. i love you all and i will always defend your right to be in the LGBT+ community!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Wow, the way you ridicule the project of abolishing gender was pretty awful and I don't believe that you don't understand the argument behind it. Those who want to abolish gender just want to get rid of gender based societal expectations. Which in no way contradicts the idea of trangendered people. It just means that those who don't wish to be forced to perform as either of two genders don't have to battle any stigma. The project of abolishing gender is in no way in opposition to transexuality however you have shown that you have some personal shit against people who don't want to be forced to be either man or woman and it really came across ugly(ly).

(Not to mention it's going to alienate and make any non-cis passing viewers feel like trash.)    Also, it couldn't of hurt to overqualify that you having seen yourself as a man who became a woman 8:20 to 8:32 is just your own particular experience, as of course, some transgender individuals have from as long as they can remember considered themselves as the gender they identify with, and generally, the phrasing 'so you're a man that became a woman?' is something cis people should realize it's not okay to approach trans women with.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"TERFs are disgusting. I am a Cis woman who embraces my trans sisters.  I admire anyone who peers within themselves, at any age, to know themselves. I say I'm cis, but I am actually a bit fluid but not fully. I'm not 'butch' but I have been accused of not being 'feminine enough' a lot. I hate the TERF equation of a woman being defined by her internal plumbing because I have had to have it all removed because it was defective. I am not a menstruator. Defining women by their internal bits lays undue stress on those who are fully female but with malfunctioning bits or partial bits from birth. They, the TERFs are also disgusting because they erase the diversity of what it is to be a woman. Every single one of the disgusting traits noted in the opening quote could be attributed to a cis woman, too. Do all women need to pass a gender test to be declared a woman?

"From an interview with Judith Butler:  'I agree completely that nothing is more important for transgender people than to have access to excellent health care in trans-affirmative environments, to have the legal and institutional freedom to pursue their own lives as they wish, and to have their freedom and desire affirmed by the rest of the world. This will happen only when transphobia is overcome at the level of individual attitudes and prejudices and in larger institutions of education, law, health care, and kinship.'   Furthermore:   'My sense is that we may not need the language of innateness or genetics to understand that we are all ethically bound to recognize another person's declared or enacted sense of sex and/or gender. We do not have to agree upon the 'origins' of that sense of self to agree that it is ethically obligatory to support and recognize sexed and gendered modes of being that are crucial to a person's well-being.'  Article also touches on Gloria Steinem's current opinion (useful to our purposes here):  'So now I want to be unequivocal in my words: I believe that transgender people, including those who have transitioned, are living out real, authentic lives. Those lives should be celebrated, not questioned. Their health care decisions should be theirs and theirs alone to make. And what I wrote decades ago does not reflect what we know today as we move away from only the binary boxes of 'masculine' or 'feminine' and begin to live along the full human continuum of identity and expression.'

"discreteness, transsexuality is a disaster for the individual transsexual. Every transsexual, white, black, man, woman, rich, poor, is in a state of primary emergency as a transsexual. There are 3 crucial points here. One, every transsexual has the right to survival on his/her own terms. That means that every transsexual is entitled to a sex-change operation, and it should be provided by the community as one of its functions. This is an emergency measure for an emergency condition. Two, by changing our premises about men and women, role-playing, and polarity, the social situation of transsexuals will be transformed, and transsexuals will be integrated into community, no longer persecuted and despised. Three, community built on androgynous identity will mean the end of transsexuality as we know it. Either the transsexual will be able to expand his/her sexuality into a fluid androgyny, or, as roles disappear, the phenomenon of transsexuality will disappear and that energy will be transformed into new modes of sexual identity and behavior.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I also had all the questions presented in this video and no place to ask them. Being genuinely curious, asking any of the questions in the video got me pegged as a TERF. So glad you did, and you did it well and seriously. The section about socialization and that it never ends never entered my mind before.  I don't know if you feel comfortable doing so, but if you could team up with a black trans woman and do a video on trans-racialism I'd appreciate it. As a black woman, it's one thing I still struggle with. I feel like if we accept one, we have to accept the other.

"You did a good job as usual helping people see your PoV and understand the harassment trans women suffer at the hands of TERFs, but I think your dismissal of the goal of overcoming the notion of gender was too flippant.  I reject the idea that it's just an excuse for transphobia, as that case wasn't really well made, and especially since I personally genuinely believe it might be an important strategy to consider when it comes to establishing an egalitarian future as relates to gender.  I agree completely when you say that _if_ someone merely uses this as a means to invalidate trans people, they're not honest actors; but I don't do that, and so while that may mean it makes my view less relevant to what you want to discuss in this video, it also means you might be missing an opportunity to discuss my view - which just might turn out to be relevant.  At the very least, you could have convinced me to shift away from it if you think it feeds into TERF propaganda.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Reading the comments I'm reminded to criticize your handling of transmedicalists. Yes, some truscum fit those criteria but the assertion that one is only trans if they experience CrIpPlInG aGoNiZiNg DySpHoRiA isn't true. All trans people experience dysphoria, hell even cispeople experience dysphoria over the appearance and functioning of their cis bodies (ever seen a woman have her boobs done? Ever seen a commercial for penile enhancement?) Seeing dysphoria as requisite to being trans isn't about self hatred, othering, transphobia, or any of that, it's about having a legitimate basis for transitioning. I don't know how many cis people have said 'I'd be fine if I woke up tomorrow in the body of a member of the opposite sex just like I'm perfectly fine with the body I have now' it's just a sign of not actually giving any consideration to what that would actually entail. They don't know that and they're probably completely wrong. Transitioning without dysphoria amounts to what? Transitioning for shits and giggles? It's okay to experience dysphoria, it doesn't make you crazy and it doesn't have to be a debilitating or terminal condition. It's more transphobic to hate people because they have gender dysphoria than it is say you need dysphoria to be trans. Also dysphoria comes in more than one flavor so you can have social dysphoria where you're uncomfortable being treated like a member of the sex assigned at birth or body dysphoria where you're uncomfortable being in a body that doesn't match how you envision yourself, just examples I'm sure there are many other ways to experience dysphoria that are all validly dysphoric. I understand that not everyone understands what dysphoria actually is and they think it means 'give me hormones and surgery or I rope' and don't want to associate with that depiction or else they are dissociated from their dysphoria and don't want to dissect or face it and just want to transition without analyzing why (why wouldn't one want to analyze and criticize everything about themself? Can't relate!) but they can still be identified as being dysphoric without having to say they are in those terms and are still trans.   Not going to discuss some of the more toxic attitudes that truscum can sometimes display because that's just internalized transphobia and likely a phase they can mature out of for most of them. Transmedicalists are also concerned with non trans people who detransition after making an oopsy and sociopaths who identify as trans and do terrible things that make trans people look bad, yeah that can get out of hand and they can start picking a girl apart for having some stray eyebrow hairs or a guy apart for showing some cleavage, but it's because they're concerned with the image society has of them because of everyone who identifies as trans, and if trans people don't have the right to be concerned about how trans people are received by society then who does? Should we just not be concerned with how trans people are received by society? Is there no correlation between how trans people are received and how they are treated?

I have seen TERF almost entirely used towards lesbians, very rarely towards straight women (even though most gender critical people are straight). I also think there's a huge incorrectness with who 'TERFS' actually are, as defined by this video. I don't really think most of them are feminists at all (faux ones maybe) but a lot of die-hard gender critical people are fairly conservative (as there is usually some homophobia splashed into their transphobia). I wish I had the 'clout' to be able to discuss this further, as someone who has been occasionally labeled as a TERF, despite the fact that I have always largely agreed with what you said in the video.

"I think any kind of 'weirdness' illicits a disgust response in humans, because our brains are programmed to view things and people that deviate from the norm as potentially threatening.  But the more attention and awareness non-harmful 'deviations' receive, the less 'weird' they become, and the less people feel that primal disgust.  Only a couple decades ago, the average person in our culture felt this way about homosexuality.  But homosexuality simply doesn't bother most people anymore.  No more disgust response.  This will happen with transexuality as well.   Contra - that judgment you have felt for yourself and for other trans women is not a reflection of anything *inherently* wrong with transness.  It's just a natural human reaction to something one perceives as outside the realm of our comfortable social norms.  Once we've normalized transexuality, people won't feel that way anymore, and hopefully, neither will you.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Something about socialization that I wish people would talk about more is like. You are socialized as ur assigned gender, sure, but what that means is entirely context dependent! For some people that barely impacts them in terms of how they view themselves at all! For some it impacts them until death! But you also are socialized to understand what the '''''opposite''''' gender 'should' be. There are plenty of trans ppl who never really internalized their assigned gender socialization but always picked up on how the other half lives, so to speak. ALSO and i appreciate u mentioning this!! Womanhood and 'female socialization' are not universal ideas, and what one might call a problematic trans woman's 'male privilege' is far more likely to be the white or affluent privilege they have maintained thru their life. These systems are so complicated and terfs reducing everything to 'wa my Wombynhood makes me INCORRUPTABLE and i hate trans people' is so sad","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Oh mama Natalie a solid 4 out of 5 fishy realness on this one.    For real. Thank you for speaking with honest about the pressure of having some origin story about what it was like growing up trans. Sometimes I'd try and talk about trying to wear dresses. It happened once, and with impossibly conservative parents that thought corporal punishment would equal manliness. Fast forward through football in high school, a marriage lasting less then a year and six years of military service. I never 'found' my masculinity. My disphoria never went away, and just got worse. Till it was either take the proverbial cyanide capsule or give this trans thing a try. So most of my years growing up was living in fear of being discovered and trying to impress these false displays of  what I thought was manliness, which really just made me an asshole. No friends and no relationships, and just fear, frustration and anxiety  Every-time I hear about or listen to these awful arguments from not just 'Gender Criticals,' but others who find it convenient to kick down at us. It's so refreshing to have a coherent perspective. My greatest fear is that I'd be forced to reverse or go back to hiding. It hurts just think about it. All the joy I have now, validation, firm sense of identity. That fear rises up each time I hear about anti-trans law, or discussions. It makes it difficult for me to be a part of the discussion.  For example. I've been in womens power lifting for roughly 2 1/2 years. I don't ever compete even though I'm not even close to other women in my weight class with more experience can lift. I'm terrified of being outed if I, goddess-forbid do well. Suddenly I become a target for all sides. I'm not looking to be the next face to show up on talk-cast or news about 'trans-women' cheating to beat women out of their own sports. Rather than discuss or enter dialogue I disqualify myself from discussion and play neutral ground. Even when my cis-female coach came out loud/proud pro-trans power lifters when the USAPL banned us from competing.   It's a lot, and a ramble but your video helped me work through some long held sticking points in my mind. Love what your doing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thank you for another brilliant video, Natalie. Concern 2 was probably one of the biggest sticking points for me before watching your other videos. In forming a personal feminist ideology from the feminist writing that is out in the world, I think it's easy to fall into this line of thinking. In the middle ground between Germaine Greer and queer/trans feminists, I think a lot of the language and ideology espoused by mainstream cis feminists still leads you down this path if they aren't careful in defining things in particularly inclusive terms. From personal experience, I would say that my own internalized misogyny made me the most hostile towards both transwomen and ciswomen who seemed to be playing to patriarchal norms and expectations. Societal conditioning still makes it easier to feel that sense of competition and resentment towards other women than the powers that be.    Concern 5 was another major issue. Thank you for taking it seriously and being so open about your own experiences.   Anyway, thank you for having the patience for those of us who are still learning and trying to do better. I never fell in with the disgust or hatefulness of the TERFs you quote but I don't think that excuses me from resisting a more inclusive way of thinking out of ignorance, laziness, and internalized misogyny. I was threatened by a theory of gender that felt like it might dismantle the core of my feminist ideology but honestly, it was mainly just easier to accept a more casual and simplistic version of feminism that didn't require as much work. It's uncomfortable to be forced to reckon with your privilege. Your knowledge of and support for the issues relevant to straight women inspires me to put in more effort to understand the issues relevant to queer women and transwomen. I will be doing my own research but if anyone wants to reply with some good theorists or essayists to add to my reading list, I would appreciate it. :)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Great video! Honestly this is one I definitely needed to see. As a straight cis male, I feel like I've always been weak on trans issues (which is somewhat ironic since other LGBT issues such as gay marriage are what got me into politics in the first place) and like I'd never truly be able to understand trans people's struggles in a meaningful way. I've never been openly bigoted against trans people and I've never identified as being 'gender critical' or formalized myself with the dogma of it, but I definitely had some of these sentiments buried deep down inside me and as an otherwise strong leftie I've at times just felt like the dance of gender (particularly when it comes to non-binary people) is a sort of hollow endeavor; the upholding of empty labels which mean little to me personally beyond the convenience of categorization. But what you said at 9:20 really hit the nail on its head and recontextualized it in a way that should've been obvious to me from the start. I've always viewed labels as tools to serve the necessary evil of utility, but it never occurred to me for some reason that most trans/non-binary people are no different, that perhaps the reason why they feel so passionately about their pronouns is not because of some attachment to the trapping itself but rather one to the sentiment contained within.

"I'm glad you finally made a video on this. I have always been confused by the gender criticals because they seemed to push valid points, like gender is a social construct, in addition to their crass bigotry, so I have had trouble finding coherent arguments made by them on the subject that aren't reactionary. Growing up I was a tomboy and was always punished for it and punished for not being feminine enough so I used to feel bothered when I saw a very feminine transwoman, because they made me feel like I have to live up to that standard or else become a transman, however I could never identify as a man, so therefore transpeople have a role in reinforcing gender stereotypes. But its not transpeople who are perpetuating this,  it's our society that doesn't allow for a lot of inbetween. I understand now that transwomen often present as very feminine because they are under even stronger pressure than I am  as a cishet woman to conform to gender stereotypes.  I have stayed away from gender criticals for the most part though because of their outright bigotry like you say.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

True there are radicals, just like there is in every belief, but for the most part the belief is that you need dysphoria to be trans. That's it. Wether that be low, fluctuating, or high, all you need is dysphoria. It's really as simple as that.

"I had a friend who once id'd as transmasc/nonbinary and detransitioned. She still felt dissatisfied w her body (as many of us do, cis or trans or whatever). And slowly i saw her move from being a dissatisfied detrans-ed woman who understandably felt uncomfortable w her previous community and her complicated feelings about her own dysphoria to a truly awful gender critical jerk sharing posts about how afab trans people's bodies are 'disgusting', the 'trans cult' is 'forcing' people to ID as trans, and eventually just out and out transmisogyny (it always comes back to transmisogyny w radfems...). And like. I, A Trans (nb) was still on speaking terms w her as this was happening (we had met thru being trans! And she'd helped me and my partner move furniture, etcetc). She hid her slide into terf communities at first, only liking posts but not reblogging them. How unsafe can u make ur friends feel like...?!  I think the wider terf community loves to act like they are being Silenced by the tyrannical genderists and she fell right into that trap... its sad.

But maybe a lot of that was lazy reporting? Because sure, it gives you something quite concrete and simple to describe that anyone in your audience could picture...but I don't feel like it is a narrative I've seen as much when reading/watching un-editorialised work from trans women, but that could also just be a function of time...

"I just discovered your channel and I love you!!! Amazing work, really on all fronts. There is something you're missing though on this topic though IMO. Terfs aside, radical feminists define gender completely differently than liberal/individualist feminists. And I think that's why there's so much confusion. I'm not sympathizing with straight up assholes, but not all rad fems are bad people. If within feminism we are working with 2 different definitions of gender then we can't even have a conversation because we're not even speaking the same language. Rad fems define gender as a class system so abolishing this violent oppressive system of power (gender) makes sense in that view. Liberal feminists define gender in a more individualist way. So its more about personal choice and expression and the right to be you.

And I love that u went through everything point by point because, even though you are right in your assessment at the end that those points are all just used by terfs to veil blatant transphobia, I think that a lot of girls who are more critical of liberal feminism (like me) hear those talking points and naturally question them too, because they have to do with interesting Big questions about gender and how it's experienced and what it even is and where we should direct our feminism, etc. But they'll never find satisfying or thorough answers in most radfem circles! Bc instead they just get the ideological extremes and feel like they have to choose between dogmatically repeating 'trans women are women' and effectively putting an end to any further discussion, or joining an echo chamber of bigots who view trans women as caricatures and won't have nuanced opinions either! So thank you so so much for making this video !! You don't even know how long I've waited for you to really get into this topic because I knew you'd do it amazing! (I do wish you'd gotten into the 'cotton ceiling' though, because I obviously don't believe most trans women want to force lesbians into having sex with them, but I've also never heard an argument that doesn't demonize either trans women or lesbians... and I don't think I'm crazy in thinking that we totally don't have to pit those groups against each other lol)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"So, I fully support the points made in this video, but I'd really appreciate that we stop with this idea that 'male privilege' is a 'cis male' thing, not a predominately 'heterosexual male' thing. Apart from the misgendering that trans-persons face, gay men are broadly seen as 'it' or 'fag' by both men and women, both white and non-white people. It's becoming a bigger issue in the discussion of women's equality because it's dismissive of widespread abuse toward gay men based purely on their genitalia. I can agree with most of the concerns raised by feminists, but I can't agree with feminists who indiscriminately point a finger at me as well for 'patriarchy', especially knowing that women have had nearly a century of equal voting rights and overwhelmingly supported candidates and legislation that displaced me legally and socially for all but the most recent 10 years.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

And Greer herself would agree that women that have any combination of these traits are not any less of women, considering her book The Whole Woman is arguing that in order for one to be female a woman doesn't have to be traditionally feminine. but ig according to her having a penis invalidates all that and suddenly all these 'unfeminine' traits are what makes you a man hmmmm","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm always baffled when TERFs say that terms like 'menstruator' or 'pregnant people' reduce women to their body parts. They do the opposite!   'Menstruator,' (though it may sound like a menacing and bloody killer robot) has no connotations beyond itself. It doesn't mean 'woman,' and therefore it doesn't reduce women to anything. If anything, it *liberates* womanhood from being merely a signifier for a small collection of body parts. By separating gender and body parts, gender can stand for more than body parts; it becomes less reductive, not more.  These terms don't reduce women to body parts, they reduce body parts to body parts.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I posted a total of two posts and was immediately banned for not being a hateful transphobe who was only there to trash your video and misgender you. It's honestly sad how insulated these communities make themselves, allowing them to eternally amplify each other's fears and hate without any chance for enough of a voice of reason to debate with them about their views and challenge them.

"A lot of these same bio women who attack hyper feminine presenting trans women for reinforcing gender stereotypes also attack other bio women who presenting hyper feminine for misogyny (eg, 'She wouldn't have gotten raped if she hadn't been wearing that. If she didnt act like a slut, we wouldn't be attacked.').  Which completely blames the victim for getting attacked and basically absolves men of their poor behavior because 'boys will be boys.' Sadly, I once believed these same excuses. But I agree with Natalie that all women should be supporting each other they way all minorities should support each other. Attacking each other, helps keep us all oppressed. And helping someone attack someone else to get the heat off of you is bullshit because when that first victim is gone, you'll be next.  Also, Dan Savage always says that women get abused by men partially because they see the same thing in women that they do in gay men (femininity) and they've been indoctrinated to hate that.  So if you're dating a homophobe, it's not a big leap to assume he's also a misogynist. Don't support that shit.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I can't even believe how well you slayed this topic! You truly have a gift for tackling topics that are tough to navigate and rife with complications and people refusing to put a glimmer of empathy into their perspective.   How this video relates to me in particular is the abolish gender part. That is what I would like to see happen but I think I take more of a pragmatic point of view, which still not everyone is okay with, and I understand why. I consider myself agender. What that entails, in my case, is an asymmetric approach to gender. People can gender me however they like, I however don't use gender back. I've made an active effort to excise gendered language from my speech unless it's a direct quotation. The reason is, I either don't understand what the gendered terms mean because gender largely makes no sense to me, or I don't know why I'm bringing it up in the first place even if I do understand it. And I consider it important to only use language I understand. And I still haven't got it all figured out yet. I don't have a gender neutral 'mr/ms' or other various terms. But I'm working on navigating that part.   This stuff. Is. Complicated. Most people don't examine gender to the extent that non-binary and trans people often do. Abolishing gender requires conversations that are a headache to go through because you have to pick apart so many definitions to stay on the same page and the approach that's necessary is so wildly different from person to person that there almost is no consolidated way of doing it. No one should have to accept being an open invitation to these discussions just for trying to exist in a space that doesn't understand it. Trans men, trans women, and non-binary people are just trying to navigate the world. And it's pretty absurd to put these conversations exclusively on their backs to solve a problem that the bulk of society is putting on to everyone too.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I think my mom is a terf and I was outed by my older sister and ignores the fact that I'm trans and honestly there is no point in me arguing with her at all. When I tried to come out to her again, she just goes on about how she's a medical coder and uses Caitlyn Jenner (deadnames her too) and how I want to cut my p*nis off which I tried to explain to her. I know once I move out and let her know and remind her of the situation, maybe then she will learn or hide behind her little walls of religion and medical coding.

"Natalie, I must say I'm very disappointed in your continued ignorance of psychological and neurological understanding of trans people in favour of strict constructionism. Gender identity as a psychological phenomenon is well validated, and the neurological evidence points to highly dimorphic sub-regions of the brain being responsible, not overall brain structure. In light of this, only considering gender a social phenomenon is a very limited view on the phenomenon, and one that I think seriously undermines trans legitimacy.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I'm really glad to know about this new term for terfs because it'll help me avoid them. I had never heard of it before. When I first saw the term 'race realist' on someone's blog header, I immediately thought they were someone who understood the realities of racism since that's what the term makes it sound like. Then I actually looked at their blog and realized 'Oh...it's just a new term for racist...the complete opposite of what I thought the term meant.' Bigoted, racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, ableist groups keep coming up with new names for themselves in order to find easier cloaks for them to hide under. We always have to stay on our feet and look out for the terms they invent for better press. They especially love to try to hijack what's considered progressive at any given moment and modify said progressive values until they fit snugly as a cover for their hate. It just makes progress towards equality even more difficult when they do that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Something I actually hate with a burning passion is when people say that being very stereotypically female is 'wrong' because you're perpetuating the patriarchy's oppression 'cause...I don't see how that's the case if it's something you're doing for yourself and your happiness. Yeah, it's bad if it's not what you want and it makes you miserable but society is forcing it upon you, but if it's your choice I see it more as reclaiming those things and empowering yourself by taking away the monopoly of the male gaze and the idea that those are things women do only for men, and finding happiness and comfort in fully expressing yourself how you wish to. Let's get into a personal example: I'm a cis female and I used to be fucking terrified of wanting to try makeup or wear a skirt because I was always the tomboy, one of the guys, 'not like other girls' (said in a toxic way, implying that I was better than other girls for not being traditionally feminine). All my life I walked the line between being perceived as better than other girls for not being like they were but also criticized for not being girly, being 'boyish', stepping out of my place and daring to try and be 'like a man'. And that mentality is toxic as fuck, it was really bad for me. Now I've managed to get the fuck over my stupid prejudice and even tho it's once in a blue moon, now makeup is a sort of power move to me. Look at me now, doing the thing I feared would compromise my identity free from all that and feeling happy and empowered. I wear makeup if I want to, and if not, I don't. I won't let myself be trapped by any one mentality (girls have to wear makeup vs being afraid of doing so because of how I usually express myself and my gender in a very non-conforming, more 'masculine' way) and I let myself live and be happy, not thinking that there are certain things that I can't do because of how I choose to present myself and express my version of femininity. 'Cause, honestly? I think that's how they win: when they convince us to oppress ourselves.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I wrote a reddit post about a year ago that I feel so ashamed now when I think about it, basically on this issue.

A few years ago I fell into the traps of Jordan Peterson,  Gamergate and the like. Thanks to you, I'm not the 'Liberal' hack I used to be, and I am so much better for it.

"As always, you're far, far too kind.  Take the 'TERF = slur' thing. No, it's not just that it's not a slur because it's not referring to people. It's not a slur because it's they fucking want to exclude trans people. They are trans exclusionary radical feminists. It is, to a word, accurate. They're mad that other people aren't using their preferred obfuscation and spin. (You know, like how they refuse to call 'pro-lifers' that, precisely because it's spin). Just like 'pro-life' is a term that ignores that most pro-lifers actually have a pretty low opinion of most human lives aside from the unborn, 'gender critical' ignores the fact a) plenty of people are critical of gender without being transphobic or wanting to exclude trans women and b) that's not the actual debate at hand. They're not just idly critical. They want to exclude trans people.  Yes, if we said 'transphobic radical feminists', that would be a pejorative. But that's not what people do. It's no more poisoning the well than calling people who oppose abortion 'anti-abortion'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I'm probably rare one out there (I sent mail too, but also - late) I totally support trans rights and I engage in online activism (as much as I can, read :my mental health allows)   _and_ I'd say I'm a gender critical.   my rationale: as gender is a social construct we need to be critical of it. critical about science on gender so far (re-evaluation of research done, mostly by biased men) and doing more research.  This is not about trans issues even, it's about 'debate' about innate vs nurtured, which is false dichotomy, actually, as we know it's both, but so many what/how/why questions are yet to be answered.  Gender critical seems so appropriate, literally. It sounds like proper skepticism, while race realism sounds like denialism. I'm hoping we stop giving them the term, just like I never call anti-abortionist 'pro-life'   Anyway, as I'm not trans, and I couldn't find the origin of the term- anybody knows if it was coined by a terf.  and what else could I use?

"Under the present system, and the system since the dawn of time, oppression of women has been based around the physical reality and implications of possessing a vagina, uterus, etc. Women have been universally and historically vulnerable by innate physical attributes (and yes this obviously includes women who can't/don't bear children). I dare anyone to go tell a child bride that they aren't being inclusive enough in their definitions of gender, and that they shouldn't just consider their 'cis-ters' as among their sisters. Tell one of millions of women who have gone through FGM. Tell victims of war rape. Tell the 1 in 3 women on the planet who have been beaten, assaulted, raped, or otherwise abused. Girlhood, womanhood, these are held up as such important concepts not because women want to cling to stereotypes or norms. They are held up, remembered, understood because half of the planet is decided to be a second class citizen the day they are born. This is not something a person can wipe off at the end of the day. This is not something that anyone who is biologically female can opt out of. Ever. In their entire life. Regardless of identity. From infancy. Fuck you for mocking suffering. Fuck you for mocking women's experiences which are devastating to them as people, reading Sylvia Plath like she was some wacky lady who just wanted to hang out with 'tHe BoyZ'. Get out of your privileged, whiney, western mindset and actually think critically for once. Get some fucking empathy. If your largest concern gender-wise is being made fun of or rejected sexually you are an extremely lucky person. Maybe 'TERFs' aren't as narcissistic as you and actually take a nuanced look at sex, gender, and how these things brutally impact 3.7 billion human beings, and don't take kindly to someone like you spitting in the face of the very real and present implications of womanhood.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Wonderful video, thanks again. I actually had such a strong bout of wanderlust listening to that Sylvia Plath quote -- but it was interesting how much I related to your commentary as well, being a homebody most of my life (the little experience I have had with bars bored me to tears). It was a strong choice of quotation but I feel like from my experience (cis woman) -- it got at a poignant lack of freedom that Plath had that I felt like your immediate response after the fact didn't quite jibe with. The idea of a freedom you admit to having and then said 'but I didn't want that!' -- it's different from Plath, who never had the option.    That said, there was a lot of subtlety in what you expressed after the fact, so I think it was more the framing that I was like 'oh this missed me'. About the complexity of trying to find a space for yourself to fit, when all those male narratives weren't really doing shit for you. I think a lot about the guiding hand of narrative with respect to gender and how that's changing. In that respect, your experience might not be entirely the same as Plath's, a kind of deeply wistful wanderlust, but you drew the parallel elegantly enough: both of you wanted a narrative that society told you 'wasn't yours'. And being told that wasn't yours to have; well, no one wants that.    In any case, n u a n c e abound as always, thank you for your work. I hope people considering gross 'gender critical' ideas see this TERF bullshit for what it is, after you've laid it out so elegantly and clearly as always.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is a nice video, and you make many excellent points.  However, I would like to make one correction.  You see I am a transmedicalist.  What this means is that I believe that one needs gender dysphoria (the distress/discomfort caused by a mismatch between brain sex (gender) and the sex one is born as) in order to be transgender.  This is not me saying 'you do not feel my pain so you do not count' this is just me saying that medical conditions have symptoms.  The medical condition of having a mismatch between brain sex and sex has the symptom of gender dysphoria.  Yes, there are transmedicalists that take it to the extreme, but most of us in the transmed community see them for what they are: assholes.  It is fine if you disagree with me, everyone is entitled to their views, but to say 'all transmeds believe that one needs to experience extreme pain in order to be trans' is just wrong.  Again, I really enjoyed your video.  Thank you, and have a nice day.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Damn right, Natalie!  Saying TERF is a slur is like saying calling someone racist is as bad as calling someone the N-word.  If it describes a person then it could be a slur but if it describes an ideology or opinion then it's just a totally valid label describing that ideology.  Are we gonna start saying that Nazi or Commie is a slur now?  People that believe that are basically saying that they're born with this ideology and this ideology defines them.  That almost sounds like they're part of a cult or something.     Also the phrase 'Terf is a slur' sounds really funny to say out loud.   It has a nice MOUTH FEEL... which is what we should be talking about.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"None of this is simple, but I've tried to approach these questions in a straightforward, respectful way.  1) I only experience my life, not anyone else's. I can't know how they feel, or all their history. Therefore, I'm less qualified to say who they are than they are. 2) I have no reason to assume they are lying. I can't imagine someone who would lie about this and put themselves on the corner between Shitstorm Street and Turdflinger Avenue.  3) Therefore, if you tell me who you are, I'll believe you. Why shouldn't I? What would it benefit me to contradict you, or act like a self-righteous cocknuckle?  I'm still trying to learn to treat people who are more or less like me (white, cis, male) with the dignity they deserve, and how to be helpful rather than hurtful. So it's to be expected that in my attempts to be supportive to people with very different life experiences I'll be clumsy and clueless most of the time. Fortunately, I have very patient friends.

"I remember on January 20th, 2017, I got up early and spent hours at the Women's March bc I was furious at Donald Trump. When I got home, there were tons of people on Tumblr complaining that there had been signs depicting the female reproductive system bc it was supposed to be a WOMENS march and not all women had uteruses. That was one of the only occasions where I felt the siren call of radfem ideology. Women's services like Planned Parenthood were under attack! How dare they try to keep us from acknowledging viable threats to bits and parts that most of us had? But for every tiny sliver of a slice of valid criticism that radfems have, there's aways a whole extra pie of hatred.

"This whole problem is caused because of misunderstanding of some of the most basic epistemological idea of what percepts and concepts are for and how they are used. You say 'she' to someone because of how they look to you. That's because you have identified female humans and their behavior in a certain way and that in turn turned into what one sees as a woman and thus the pronoun. It's about how YOU experience the world, not how the person you are talking to wants the world to be. It's a pure act of subjectivism to think otherwise. I will not call you 'he' if you ask me to when you look like a woman to me. That will destroy the entire point of that word. Concepts and percepts are used consistently in order to live and survive. There is no point in trying to change the reality of things. If you look and act like a woman, I will call you she. If you look and act like a man, I will call you he. If you are somewhere in the twilight zone or some weird mix, I'll simply have to settle for one of the two - it doesn't matter which and this kind of situation is not an indicator of the method being false; it's a lifeboat situation.  I also wanted to point out that this video was really hard to watch at times. The amount of cuts was way overboard.

"I think it also helps to notice that 'feminism' has had to substantially rely on sexual dymorphism because especially in what is generally considered the 'first wave' of western feminism was literally a time of quack science. Racism was starting to get a thoroughly scientific sheen applied to it and it was simply *in vogue* to pull from biological science to justify both the old and the new dogmas.   The second wave was dominated by white middle class women looking to have the sexual, economic, and educational oppression they faced recognized. The vocabulary was then developed to protected that status quo, but yet again give it a sheen of theory that used biological dymorphism to be the *in vogue*  means of exploring these oppression(s).  In my experience, as a recovering terf and baby trans, this rhetoric that overwhelmingly saw biology as the main reason I, as a person, was subjected to sexual violence and therefore anyone who challenged that notion, was challenging the narrative I constructed around my trauma.  To describe the visceral response of that as 'lizard brained' is only right to an extent--what would go on for me is absolute full fight or flight--to be triggered.  I imagine that is true for a lot of [low level] terfs.    So however you describe your feminism, if it isn't open to traumatized individuals--or it in fact preys on traumatized individuals like terfs do--it isn't effective feminism, and is even more at risk for dogma and hierarchy.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I love me some hating on Germaine Greer, so I just wanna drop that she constantly pulls the 'Of course the tr*nnies have male privilege! I can always tell when they're trans. I've never seen one I couldn't tell was trans!'  The sheer logical problem with this line of thinking is something called 'the Toupee Fallacy.' A guy says, 'All toupees look fake. I've never seen one I couldn't tell was fake.' The problem, of course, is that if you gather your data that way, any hypothetical real-looking toupees have slipped under your radar. I like to imagine that after seeing that deep-voiced trans woman in a wig, Greer shook hands with like 12 other trans women in line who were short and had managed to grow long hair on their own, and Greer was completely oblivious.  Btw, the Toupee Fallacy only applies to the method, not the items. Trans women, unlike toupees, are real.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Great video as usual Nat, but can I just point out transmedicalists don't believe you need to be in excruciating mental pain to be transgender, transmeds don't believe you have to been in any kind of anguish whatsoever to be valid. It's just the belief that being trans is not something you choose and is instead set from the forming in the womb, and that you need gender dysphoria to be trans, and this is where I feel the whole misunderstanding begins. The definition of (general) dysphoria includes depression, anxiety, discontent etc, whereas gender dysphoria, despite having dysphoria in the name, only means that you must feel somewhat of a discontentment with being perceived as your birth sex, and in addition to this a sense of contentment when being perceived as your actual gender or transitioning in anyway. Transmedicalism is very much misunderstood, and I feel like a lot of tucutes have almost identical opinions as us, it's just that they think we believe trans people must hate themselves in order to be 'valid', which is entirely not the case. If anybody's gotten to the end of this long ass comment thank you for your time, whatever side of the debate you're on.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

What makes me a man, for example, isn't just that I look like a man or get treated like a man or even feel like a man.

But what kept me from buying their ideas was that their description of the universal female experience that trans women haven't had included a fair number of things *I* had never experienced as a cis woman. My family, my race, my class, my religion, and maybe even my temperament (I've been told I give off 'don't f*** with me' vibes) have kept me pretty sheltered from the worst misogyny Western society has to offer. Even things like menstruation - let's just say that's a very different experience when you have severe endometriosis! Every woman's experience is different because we're all unique. I don't see why we have to exclude trans women just because they likewise each unique.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Germaine Greer isn't a fanatic. Trans-women are the most vocal & visible, monopolising the discourse, making 'transgender' synonymous with 'trans-woman'. If you're talking about trans-women, then say 'trans-women', not 'trans-people'. Is it really that hard for you trans-women to not erase non-binary people & trans-men? Radical feminists classify 'trans-men' the same as AFAB non-binary people, & gender nonconforming cis-women - they don't conform to femininity. On what basis do you reject this classification in favour of grouping trans-men & trans-women together? Even trans-women are transphobic: they wouldn't date another trans-woman, they want to be mistaken for a cis-woman & those who get bottom surgery want to become cis-women. They even have an androcentric view of the vagina (as an entrance, instead of an exit). Men aren't 97% of combat fatalities though (90% are civilian deaths), so that's a false equivalence. The brain correlation is actually between brains with the same sexual orientation. Trans-women attracted to women have the same brains that straight men do. You said womanhood & femininity are separate & that you saturate yourself in feminising gender indicators just so that you can hear the word: ma'am? But ma'am is also just femininity - a construct. So the means & the ends could just as well have been exchanged. So what *is* this elusive womanhood you seek? Every time you conform to patriarchal standards of womanhood you are crossing a picket line. Scabs are part of the problem. The gender utopia is far away, & vocal trans-women drive us all further from it. You falsely accused radical feminists of not criticising femininity when performed by cis-women. They do. A LOT. You strawmanned the privilege argument: just because it's hard for you, doesn't mean it's not still easier for you than every other demographic. E.g. obscenity laws against male-interest, pornographic-material was hard to fight against, but not nearly as hard as the female equivalent would have been. So check your privilege. TERF *is* a silencing-tactic gendered-slur, just like 'man-hater'. 'Bottom surgery' *is* undeniably mutilation. It's a primitive procedure that compromises the function of healthy tissue. Only 30% of trans-women are crazy enough to pay a butcher an exorbitant fee to cut off their penis & shove it up their arse. Just because mutilation is the best butchers can manage today doesn't mean it's magically not mutilation. Radical feminists never said that trans-women not being masculine is bad & equivalent to them being feminine. Trans-women minimally feminise their name, hair & clothes - all constructs. Most women can't see how stupid they look, but the sight of Don Quixote-esque pathetic mimicry will always be met with ridicule. You think you'd be safe from a radical feminist's scrutiny if you were a cis-man?? You're not being singled out for being trans, but for being male. How can radical feminists be transphobic, when their criticism is levied at men, all men, whether trans or not? You admitted to feeling disgust towards trans-women, which makes you a TERF. People are disgusted by femininity. Can't compare homosexuality to transgenderism, the majority of homosexuals don't desist before adulthood!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Here's the thing: I've been persuaded out of a lot of viewpoints in my life, including homophobia, transphobia, etc. It wasn't done by people shouting at how my opinions are wrong, or insults, or physical violence/threats.  It was by somebody listening, understanding, or cracking a joke even though they had every right not to do so. If there's anything we all need right now, it's a little bit of grace towards others.

"i feel like your videos are massively important, because its incredibly valuable to have nuanced conversations about the trans experience. and it really highlights how badly terfs have degraded our ability to talk about our experiences and answer common questions, because our experiences are so often attacked and those questions are so often asked in bad faith. terfs have made it so that to outside eyes, we must present as a unified front, we must have full confidence in everything about our transness, because otherwise any weakness is maliciously exploited as an in to attack us. the reason i think your videos are so important is that youre not just a trans person talking about your own experience, youre doing it in a space you more or less control, something a lot of us as trans people dont have. and, in my opinion, youre doing an excellent job of taking questions that ARE asked in good faith in the heads of cis people (the ones that arent full-on terfs, but still have the same transphobia instilled in all of us who have grown up in this hell world), and addressing them with the nuance and perspective they need. i feel we REALLY need to have more visibility on trans people who approach topics in this way, because if all we ever say are the oft-repeated catch-phrases -- which are oft-repeated BECAUSE we need them to protect ourselves from bad actors -- then those bad actors will be the ones controlling the conversations. theyll be the ones 'answering' those questions with their transphobic bullshit. we NEED visible trans people like you who will address these topics. im really grateful for the work you do, natalie. thank you.

However, as someone who may be considered atleast a bit on the 'terfs' side if you will (I'm a cis-straight-ish male), I want to talk more about the practical complaints that terfs have against having trans-women within their spaces. I mean like showers, bathrooms and so forth. There, in my humble opinion, is a very real concern for men posing as trans-women if we suddenly break all the former rules for separating biological male and females. Sure... in a lot of places it might be okay like San Francisco, but what about the slums of Brazil or any given inner-city ghetto in the US? They have segregated bathrooms for a good reason and there isn't any real way to know if someone truly identifies as a woman. All the philosophyical stuff goes out of the window in these cases and I think its something that isn't touched on enough. What about prison too? Should we throw a person in prison based on what they identify with? If that's the case, I will argue I'm a female to a judge because I'd MUCH rather go into a female prison than a males prison (no dissrespect to the hardcore motherfuckers in the female prisons, but the males are fucking nuts). EDIT - and anyone that believe men won't take advantage of this is completely ignorant. I've been to prison. I know how deviase male sexual predators can be. You give some of these guys an inch and they damn sure will take a mile and another mile to top it off. I will honestly say that its a very real possibility that a male will rape a female by taking advantage of new laws that allow people to use whatever facilities they want based on their gender. Is that something I could live with even though I technically agree with the heart of your argument? Am I transphobic for saying this? I don't think so.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Wouldn't it be fair to say that transgender has fragmented the idea of feminity (also masculinity) into many parts and this is causing an understandable dissonance? Now we have the reproductive female, the gender stereotypical behavioured female, the biologically born female, and the physical attributed female. You could be one, many or all of these and for each who is, may or may not want to be identified as female. Yet people are predispositioned to the concept of a female as being an all or none. A large portion of their existence has been modelled on this assumption and they don't really know how to function without it...","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There is a trick to overcome transphobia or any kind of 'ugliness aversion' : none of our archetypes of 'beauty'  are biologically predefined, they are more like a variable in a program's code. This 'variable' is defined by observation and interpretation of others, a normal mean of features and attitudes is created under the hood of you brain, it defines what is ugliness and what is beauty. This is mainly developed during your early life, but it can be completely altered at any. Proof: it is what addvertising does to sell you their crap, to make you belive their crap is beautiful, but is just a piece of stuff.     It is rationally prior to feel good with yourself, you don't have to adulate yourself like with all of your forces like a narcisist, but to feel happy. We shall brainwash ourselves insisting on our latent beauty, we shall encircle ourselves with people that sympathise and empathise to create a new meaning of beauty that excludes none. Embrace ugliness with love, because behing the ugliness of flesh and bones lives a person just like you. Do it and you'll be rewarded with completeness, the comprehension of endless beauty, do it with everybody, do it with yourself.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"TERF's are basing their world view in a pseudo-materialist (scientistic) philosophy. A superstitious world view, I believe it's the Dawkins/Hitchens model of feminism.  I would recommend reading Markus Gabriel's 'Why the World Does Not Exist' for his ontology of Fields of Sense; and though Markus never says anything about gender, I think his ontology is very useful for understanding our current cultural/social developments with regards to sex and gender.   The gist of it: there are various fields of sense, and anything that exists, exists in so far as it appears in a field of sense. Thus, a woman can appear in biology, anthropology, culture, in a social practice, in fashion, in a hallucination, in fiction, in movies, etc. Each field irreducible to each other with the possibility of overlapping. This is what let's us simultaneously offer an explanation for why a woman presents a hormonal profile different from that of men, and explain why Cinderella or Wonder Woman are women (even if they have no genitals or hormones), as we can explain why in the 21st century it is feminine to use high heels which were initially used by men in past centuries and considered masculine, so establishing commonalities without reducing. So transgender women are women because they appear in various fields of sense generally associated with being a woman. Therefore, biology (and evolutionary psychology) would be one of those fields capable of explaining what we associate with women, and doesn't exhaust the gender at all. The confusion lies in the obtuse equivalence of being a woman and being part of the female sex; the very designation let's us know that there is a difference between being a female (in the species) and being a woman (in every other field). It's as simple as that. But it would also be highly erroneous to wipe out the field of biology, psychology, or other (natural) scientific fields which are highly capable (and they do) of establishing commonalities and the causes of sex and gender; it doesn't mean they have the final word, not even slightly.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I don't know if it is merely my perception based on my own experiences, but it seems like acceptance of trans rights has slipped backwards significantly over the past ten years. Because I get the impression that there is much more controversy than there was a decade ago. It almost seems that because the right pretty much lost the same sex marriage issue--that they focused on for so many years--they've now turned their hate goggles towards the trans community.   Now this is coming from a cis male point of view that is going to be limited by lack of first hand experience. So I'm wondering what any trans men or women out there think regarding whether there has been progress over the past decade, or whether you feel like things have gone backwards? I know this isn't really the same topic of the video, but it is something that has been on my mind for awhile.   Great video as always though!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Stop using 'tranny.' It's fine for trans women to use that term for themselves but you have an audience of 530,000 and counting and, especially these days, the vast majority are cis. Not only that but being a public video you obviously can't be sure that everyone watching is okay with the term and doesn't have triggers from it.   Also; you talk about how trans women who don't pass talk like you don't understand a lot of aspects of our lives. You reject that notion. You then go on to say you haven't been misgendered in SIX MONTHS. I've been out for four years and I still get correctly gendered about once a month if I'm lucky. Given that you keep saying hurtful things about non-passing trans women (I will legitimately never stop quoting you saying 'There is nothing homosexual about a man's attraction to a trans woman who's been on hormones a couple years' and giving people an out about 'how feminine' or how medicalized someone has to be before them fucking a guy isn't gay) it's pretty clear that you do indeed not understand a lot of aspects of our lives.   Also; you absolutely did not handle the male privilege thing well at all. I actually agree with you that some trans women experience something akin to male privilege, with Caitlyn Jenner being an excellent example. But you barely glossed over the fact that most trans women internalize their womanhood long before coming out. You barely glossed over how much misogyny gets internalized and damages us, how it piles up - without any of the relief that is offered from female friendship cliques - and then comes tumbling down when we do eventually transition. You barely gloss over how being in the closet is statistically, factually a colossally damaging thing and how internalizing trans misogyny keeps us there for longer and longer as we tell ourselves for years that we can't be women, how much the self-loathing from cis and trans misogyny damages us. I also don't have some 'came out at 5' narrative, but I do have diary entries, and despite not transitioning until 26 I have entries from as young as 14 saying 'I know I wish I was a girl.' I wouldn't remember these if they weren't written down, and I truly believe all trans people have these thoughts but often forget about them, or maybe even they never consciously let them bubble up. If it's true that even the 'late bloomers' have always internalized their womanhood whether they realize it or not that explains how us having male privilege is impossible.   You barely touch on all this stuff, despite the ABSOLUTE FUCKING DANGER of telling TERFs that we have male privilege with almost no disclaimer or explanation. That's obnoxiously reckless.   Oh, and did you REALLY need to give a time and place for the trans woman you saw who made your internalized transphobia kick into high gear with? Didn't cross your mind that anyone who matches that description is going to be devastated?   To your credit the rest of the video was pretty good.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thank you Natalie, that was beautiful and devastating on so many levels. I'm a cis straight woman and I will always stand by my trans sisters and brothers, along with all LGBTQ people. I never understood people who fought hard for the rights of one particular group but denied another's right to even exist and not only did not help them, actively tried to hurt and harm and erase them. Have TERFs forgotten why they fought against the patriarchy? It does seem to be a pattern though. Maybe kinda like the abused-abuser cycle? Or maybe they're just lizard-brained bigots.  I can never truly understand how it feels to have TERFs or homophobes question my right to exist but sometimes I think that not-knowing, or the fear of getting it wrong, holds cis straight people back.   If I'm honest, that's definitely been a weakness of mine - even writing this message has me worrying I'll be misconstrued or not use the right language, but, I mean.. at the risk of going a bit dark, when my partner died many people avoided me and didn't offer support out of a fear of not understanding or doing the wrong thing. While I totally get it, I don't want to be one of those people. Anyway, I understand much better now thanks to your amazing videos! ","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

You also completely missed the teeeny tiny concern about changing all language from sex to gender getting rid of things like it being a violation of a woman's civil rights to fire her for being pregnant.

"While transphobia certainly has a role in TERFs' objections, I think you overlook the fundamental root cause: an obsessive hatred of men. Trans women are hated on that basis...every insult you read from TERFs in your video is about making fun of the physical characteristics of MEN, while chauvinistically elevating women. The corollary to that is that trans men are seen in a much less harsh light...traitors to their sex, yes, but ultimately 'wayward lesbians' who simply don't know any better, having been brainwashed into 'internalizing the misogyny'.

"20:00 I'd also note that the way TERFs root their identity in pain is often paired with their tendency to universalize personal experiences and erase those of others.   You see this a lot in the way some will argue that dealing with sexual advances is a defining feature of girlhood, because that's what they dealt with growing up.  Not only is that not true for all cis women, but some trans women(like myself) know exactly what that's like and are survivors of CSA.     It's just another symptom of their incredibly binary worldview, that doesn't deal with messy realities of life very well.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Yup. You've summed up a lot of the concerns even us allies have, but don't really want to ask because we know it's confronting, rude and/or upsetting. For me I dislike it when a minority of non-binary people (typically afab) listen to me talk about my childhood and diagnose, for lack of a better term, certain aspects of it as trans or nb experiences, suggesting that I might be non-binary or claiming such experiences solely for non-cis people. Which is annoying as hell because *no* I'm not non-binary and I'm annoyed when you try and label me as such based on superficial views of my experiences, just because I was a 'tomboy' or didn't appreciate being forced into super femme roles doesn't make me not female.   So in that way the notion of abolishing the gender binary is a little concerning to me, even if I think it's ultimately for the best. But then I only strongly identify as female because feminity is devalued and being a woman is shitty sometimes.  If we lived in a society where sexism didn't exist *then* I think we can abolish the binary, but not before. Because often the binary is strongly tied to our self-worth. 'No wrong way to be a woman' 'womens work is valuable work' ect. And I think trans women have similar concerns in that often the only way to signal their identity is by conforming rigidly to binary views of womanhood and without a binary they would have no anchor.  But ultimately everyone's experiences with their own gender is different and I really don't see how being initially raised as the opposite gender can really be 'too different.' My socialisation was female yes, but it was also very equitable and free compared to many others. Does that make me 'less female'? Of course not. It's concerning to me that so many cis women consider their gender identity to be painful, not positive. That's awful.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"went and watched the video of stephanie. I do not really know what to say. to be honest, the officers may have been in the wrong. just seems like inexperience, but even if they were, I am not to sure they would have handled it much different. ofcourse in my opinion, I deal with situations like this quite a bit. it was not really much about the specfic person or about trans. it was just that she was being difficult.   I am not saying anyone was right or wrong. I just saw the edited version. I understand how you and others will see the officers doing an attack on her as a person, on being trans, especially with the previous commentary. but I have seen these types of officers make the same comments with cis men and women who are being difficult. if her legal name was stephanie, I am sure that's what they would have addressed her by.   again, I understand that stephanie has had a lot to deal with as I am live in the same city is this city is very unique.   I guess I am just rambling. not really sure why I am still writing this and if I post it. yeah he could have used the name she wants to be addressed by, he didnt need to make comments about her looks and eyebrows. he could have let her shield  her eyes from the sun. he was a dick. it is weird. I agree with all that and would also be a person to call all thos out with the officer. but the way stephanie was is a type of attitude that gets to me.  it makes me think of once I was doing security, this woman came up to me asking for help from another woman wanting to beat her up. I said on, the other person talked with me calmly and I said I as a person can not let her do anything in my presence. once she acknowledged my position, she said ok, then the one asking for help started talking back to the one who was chasing her. I got so aggravated, that I said I would let the her be dragged off property and be beat if she didnt stop talking mess. it shut her up and everything got figured out after that. I dont know how this compares and I am sure it is not related. I am sure  i am writing an unfocused arguement. I think it is something to do with attitude or personality or something. oh well.

"this video filled my heart. The dissing of transmeds/truscum, the systematic takedown of every terf argument, standing absolutely solidly against the claim that 'terf is a slur'. I am a cis woman, but I tend to spend a lot of time in lgbt communities and arguing for more contemporary lgbt platforms, and your content always helps guide me in the right direction for helpful instead of harmful support. You deserve to go down as one of the great minds of this decade, and if you continue with the same quality content I'm sure that will be the case. My only criticism was the somewhat glossed-over dismissal of the abatement of gender, something i personally support. I don't support literally getting rid of gender, I support gender desegregation and erasing the notion that gender holds any power genetically over your personality/brain chemistry, and only determines things about physical presentation and hormone levels. Essentially, getting rid of 'gendered' items and spaces that have nothing to do with the medical side of gender, and opening those items and spaces up to whoever wants to be involved. But I do digress this is a lofty aspiration, and overall is not a luxury most trans people get to consider/support, because gender presentation is so important for safety and comfort. Anyway, I'm a ginormous fan, and I greatly appreciate your content","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"as always, i love all your insight and nuance, especially here because terf rhetoric is where nuance goes to die. i'm a cis woman who's had short hair for most of my life, and i used to get misgendered or asked 'are you a boy or a girl' by little kids when i was younger. when i was like ten, i remember seeing p!nk on tv and i was like 'she has short hair and she's a straight* girl, so i can have short hair and be a straight* girl!' (surprise...turns out we're both bisexual lol). the point here being, i was read as queer and 'not woman enough' by society from a young age, and the fact that i'm visibly physically disabled complicated the whole 'not woman enough' thing. so as i got older i felt this sort of kinship with trans and gender nonconforming women for being on the outliers of 'acceptable' womanhood, but i was always really frustrated with the dominant mainstream narrative of, 'i knew i was a girl because i liked pink and playing with dolls as a kid.' it wasn't until a genderqueer friend of mine explained to me that, regardless of someone's actual experience, many trans woman *have to* present these types of hyperfeminine narratives to be taken seriously as women, and even to receive proper medical care in some circumstances. it really put the issue into perspective for me and helped me understand how the gender binary and rigid obligatory gender roles harm everyone in different and varying ways. also, fuck terfs.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a trans man it's just so exhausting to sit through person after person who just doesnt believe you (and you can spot it instantly even if theyre well mannered) and the feeling that every typical person I meet wont really see me as a man, but a deluded woman, is crushing. I spend so much time and mental energy arguing and arguing with my inner 'Dr. Gender Critic' over and over again that I'm truly a man, because MRI brain scans, because childhood behaviour, because dysphoria, but I hadn't realised how utterly pointless and draining the whole thing was until Contra mentioned it here. Most transphobes simply aren't interested in having genuine debates about what gender truly means or where it comes from, and moreover how eerily deep internalised transphobia buries its ugly roots into your psyche that you dont even realise how much you hate yourself specifically for being trans, and I think that's exactly where transmedicalists formulate the belief that being trans and not utterly dispising yourself are inherently mutually exclusive. You made a wonderful job of both arguing against transphobic rhetoric while avoiding the trap of reenforcing the circular reasonsing of transphobia, internal and external, and I really feel on a big level like I've come away from this starting to let go of that constant anxiety of proving my own manhood to myself.

"I object to the use of the term 'assigned' to describe someone's birth gender because it carries the implication that the gender put on the birth certificate was intentional, as oppose to being a response to observable phenomena. Now, this does occur sometimes, in the case of people who are born intersex and have their male genetalia removed to conform to a single-gender norm, but unless you were born intersex it isn't appropriate to use the term 'assigned' to describe your birth certificate gender, you were born that gender, accept it. But I also don't like the transgender movement in general because I perceive it as going against my own goals, which are to destroy the divider between what males and females are allowed to do/like, by forcing people who don't conform to their birth gender's norms into the other gender's camp, for example forcing tomboyish girls to transition to being boys or girlish boys to transition into being girls. While I recognize that this doesn't generally describe trans people there is enough anecdotal evidence that it happens to be concerning.   I'm also amused by the difference between how race and gender are treated, if I as a white woman decided to wear Asian style clothing, or heaven forbid dress in blackface because I have more in common with Asian or black culture than with white culture I would get yelled at for appropriating someone else's culture or trying to wear another race as a costume. On the other hand if I as a white woman decided to dress in men's clothes and call myself a man I would be celebrated as an emblem of diversity rather than told that men (or women) are not a costume that can just be taken off or put on (actually the right would tell me that). Seems contradictory and I think it's a bear worth wrestling with.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This addresses part of my worldview, but not well. I understand trans people presenting a more stereotypically gendered aesthetic in order to avoid being misgendered, but I personally dislike stereotypical gender presentations. I 'identify' as male only because I don't care enough about my personal gender aesthetic to work on altering it. I work with what I've got. Sometimes I wear makeup and more 'feminine' clothes depending on how I feel that day, but my body is too muscular, facial hair too dark and thick, and voice too deep to even consider presenting as female. Even if I did present as female, I would change nothing about my outward aesthetic, and prefer to be more on the neutral end, combining 'masculine' and 'feminine' style that I enjoy. I don't think abolishing gender roles means becoming human mayonnaise, the way you present it. I think it means that a man can wear dresses and makeup, a woman can wear flannel and grow out their chops, and they may continue to identify primarily as their sex from birth, no gender roles required. I support trans rights, but I'm conflicted because in some ways, extreme gender expression is diametrically opposed to my preference of abolishing roles and stereotypes historically associated with one's sex organs.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Makes me wish there were a Trans-Parallel Feminism to discuss issues of sex and gender from the outsider-to-insider perspective that can really shine a light on things. TERF blowback strikes me as a reaction to trans women exploring feminine spaces, where a lot of female pain is explored/worked through/griped about free from a male presence. They're in a place where they need that space to be as wrong as possible. Some will grow out of it. Others won't. Some are happy when they hear about a Vagina Monologues production coming to town, and get pissed when it's shut down because some well-meaning idiot decided 'not all women have vaginas' was a good excuse to deprive cis women a show. It's that insistence on having new-to-womanhood talking points superseding long-held conversations about feminine pain that's causing such a shitstorm. Which, sadly, does happen and is absolute bullshit when it does. There ought to be a place for every woman in feminism.

The Yixing pots are the first spouted pots intended for brewing tea, but the act pouring came later. For a time they let the tea drinker remove themselves from structures and ceromies surrounding tea consumption, because it was portable.

Not gonna be his experience when he's around non-black people.

"i'm sorry i missed your twitter post!   i guess i come to this from a completely different angle - less from the radfem side and more from fundamentally not understanding what gender is.   I suspect there are a lot of folks out there persuaded by gender critical because their entire experience of gender, as far as they can tell is what is externally imposed. I still don't understand what it could possibly mean to 'be' or 'feel like' any gender, and so the terf idea that actually, there is no gender, its just expectations and experiences in the world resonates way more than 'what if you woke up in a male body' as if that will somehow awaken my sense of gender, a concept i still don't understand.    I've always been off put by any generalizations of any gender anything, and found as little comfort in rad fem 'all males are violent, all women are safe' as 'i just know im a woman/man'. I don't know what it means to 'be a woman' and so the idea that maybe gender as a concept actually makes no sense, is appealing.   I think the best thing for me, personally, would be a further acknowledgement of that issue, and maybe that means more non-binary, or specifically agender/no gender whatever representation, i don't know. I can't imagine im that unique of a case.  What's helped me is just thinking of gender as a thing i don't have but other people do. No idea what it is, but I also don't understand why people want to have pet snakes, and yet, there are plenty of people who do.  But honestly, I feel like i can't even say if i do have a gender because i still don't know what that even means.  That said, I found terf spaces to be just as bad. Partially because I have no hatred for trans women and find that vitriol gross, and partially because gender stereotypes of all kinds make me deeply viserally uncomfortable. I have been told this could be a kind of non-binary dysphoria but i have no idea how i'd know. RadFems for all their critiques of the idea of female essence, it feels a lot like they have their own version of that that feels just as unwelcoming. They'll claim not to check your female scorecard if you have the right parts or chromosomes and then say things like 'all women know what its like to _____'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm pretty sure cis people can understand the metaphor 'trapped in wrong body' if they try. Most of the teenagers experienced some form of dysphoria and though it's hard to actually equate trans experiences to cis one's feeling that you should be different and you don't belong the way you are isn't that foreign. I do understand that it's a stretch and cis kids mostly grow out of or able to cope, not to mention that unlike BDD, gender dysphoria isn't a mental illness, while trans people can struggle through their entire life, trying to match their inner self with their body's. But when I was a teen I had severe depression die to extreme BDD. I hated myself, even my voice and the way I walk. Not as I suppose to be. Not myself. Did pretty much everything, self harm, drugs, suicide attempts - even meds weren't as helpful as my parents thought. I still don't know how I finished high school, since most of my 16 to 18 is more of blur. And though my case's probably a bit extreme, most of my friends and people I know experienced something like that, one way or another. So it makes me believe that cis people just don't want to dig that deep and think to much about it. It's easier to say - boys are this way and no other, girls are this everything other is - perversion and sickness.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I was gat called for the first time at 9 being small with very curly hair.  I was beaten and spit on for being fem. I internalized the message woman did because I have never thought male even though I tried, god did I try. I laid awake at night and wanted god to either make me a woman or for me to just not wake up. If I was with people who knew me I was treated as a sissy, and away from those people I was the tomboy told to grow up get a dress, etc. I didn't learn to fake a male voice until I was 16, have never grown an Adams apple.

"Thank you for this. I am a cis woman and a feminist and I never understood or agreed with the radical feminist thought except for the two things you talked about - male socialisation and privilege. I think I only agreed with some radical feminists when they talked about the experience of reproductive oppression as integral to being a woman because I did experience that since I was a child. That and the constant threat of male violence that is signified to us in a million ways every day. These early formative experiences and my own socialisation as a woman, as what a 'woman' should be, has shaped me into who I am. Self effacing, unsure of my own voice, and someone who has to minimise herself to provide space for the men around her. So I think when I was reading radical feminist thought which wasn't rooted in transphobic lizard brain disgust (which is just the pits and I'm sorry you experience that everywhere) but talked about these aspects of affective experiences of violence that some transwomen didn't necessarily go through, throughout their lives. After watching this, I understand that better - I think cis women feel resentful because female spaces have been so hard to claim and hard won that to include experiences of womanhood that they don't relate to, especially when they see someone who experienced male socialisation while growing up. I think to make such spaces wider and include a type of gender oppression they themselves didn't experience,  requires a type of empathy and understanding which can be hard but still necessary. It boils down to this question right? Is womanhood all about an experience of pain? Like I've been experiencing misogyny since before I was born (they kill girl children in India through sex selective abortion + overwhelming son preference) and I could say, well, a transwoman has only begun to experience it since their transition. This is not to deny or dismiss their experiences of violence and dysphoria and all the things a transperson went through as a child. I think trans exclusionary radical feminism stems from that - I've been fucked over all my life and I made a space and now, why are you claiming it too? I could never resolve this for myself. I thought transphobia was fkn shit, but I also thought the radical feminists had a point. How do I hold these two viewpoints when agreeing with radical feminists (theoretically even), contributes to the active dehumanisation of transwomen? I didn't have an answer. Until I did, I opted to support transinclusive feminism but I didn't completely diss all radical feminists either because I felt I had to address these reservations I had. Which I now see is the stolen valour thread of things. (Listening to your experiences with terfs turns my stomach and it doesn't feel remotely feminist to engage in that kind of bullying and hate towards transpeople, I'm truly sorry)  Watching your video helped me answer that for myself. The experience of womanhood that is truly common to ciswomen and transwomen is the misogyny of the patriarchal  world we inhabit. It might manifest differently, we might experience it differently but it comes from the same place. It's like well, we both have shitty lives coz we're women, maybe my experience of it began earlier than yours, so 'I'm the bigger victim here.' It's silly and childish but I can understand it. Now that I do, I feel like I can move past it too.   Being a ciswoman doesn't mean my individual experiences of misogyny or collective experiences of misogyny alone should define what what womanhood means. There is more to being a woman than the experience of violence I think. Comparing the degree and nature of violence that ciswomen and transwomen go through in some kind of victim Olympics serves no one especially not us. It serves the fucking patriarchy that brutalises the rest of us and upholds a toxic cis male masculinity at the apex of the pyramid of gender oppression. To be unable to pitch feminist tents bigger and not be able acknowledge the experience of transmisogyny as misogyny - I think I'm better than that. Thank you. God. I love your work and everything you do. So much love and power to you.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I felt left behind, left there to stew in a gruel of self doubt.

"So 15 years ago, my university's nascent FemSoc had a discussion on whether or not to allow male members... wait, no, not like that *sigh*  Now, I really value a man-free space, because a couple of men have been majorly shitty  to me and many men have been minorly shitty to me. However, I didn't feel I could argue in favour of excluding men because I didn't want to exclude non-binary people or start gate-keeping transitioning people. Also, it wasn't intended specifically as a space for survivors of male violence, and individual men might add value to FemSoc and, like, be better people for joining. And we did welcome the dudes, and it was good.  It was a loss, in some ways, to not have a nice relaxing, female-only space, but I told myself 'well, trans women have it worse than cis women, so take the hit.'

"I think for a lot of feminist who at least entertain Terf ideas is just a lack of understanding. This is how I felt most of my life and still at least partly feel. When I was about 12 I first heard about Trans people and in my mind gender was always something that just did not exist. So since brain sex doesn't exist how can anybody be born in the wrong body? This is something you also pointed out but your answer was sadly still dissatisfing to me. What probably separates me from Terfs is that I think it's a plain lack of understanding. A mistake on my side. I would also never misgender or invalidate the identity of any Trans person. I just can't bring my feminist believes into cohesion with the existance of Trans people. But Trans people do exist I see it right in front of me. It's very clear to me that I'm wrong but I still don't fully get it. I think part of it is because cis woman and trans woman while experiencing similar oppression in some aspects have vastly different experiences in others (as you pointed out as well). I for example always deeply hated the reproductive aspect of my body (not my female body as a whole though) while many trans woman want a female body and rightfully so to match their gender identity","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I've got a friend (who I'm more distant from nowadays) who was rather anti-trans, and who I've been trying to debate for a while. They worked in a garden centre and said that there were multiple trans women who didn't pass but who they had to be polite to. In addition my community has a seemingly above average number of eccentric people who are just accepted and so it's hard to judge whether responses received are due to actual passing or accepting/being polite to the difference.

One of the issues that frustrate me is that I want to accept and want to understand the trans / non-binary community as a whole, but if I don't immediately understand a few terms, or need clarification on something without denying it exists, I am ridiculed and considered someone who hates them. I mean I do, but I hate everyone. Is this true equality? These are all fairly new topics and even in the time I tried to learn this culture, or identity, or insert correct term that shows a genuine effort to understand something I have no base of knowledge in, you introduced like 5 new terms I hadn't even heard of. Thank you for that.   Regardless, I don't want you to think that you have an echo chamber and it's the same people watching your videos and praising you on your high quality videos. You've helped me see a new side I wasn't getting exposed to. It takes a certain level of awareness and analytics to see both view points and see the merits of both without either getting deeply offended and raging or dismissing it outright. Us centrist assholes really appreciate it. I'd donate or help in some way, but being this centrist filth you describe me as is great for my bank account. Hooray for monetary independence.

I'm still trying to figure out if I am Cis or NB but as someone who has presented as a cis woman, while i once shunned the trappings of femininity, I have begun to cling to them after experiencing a great deal of unacceptance as I was. I wasnt boy or butch enough to be seen as legitimately queer with my curves but I wasnt refined,polite or....hairless and polished enough to be seen as a good woman. It led me to think 'fuck gender,' until I learned that I should embrace myself whatever my gender or whatever I am as a woman. I only am trying to fit the conventional idea of ideal woman for the sake of avoiding derision and loss of opportunities. I feel ashamed but some of the rituals are a bit cathartic.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"In the early 1990s, this feminist framework was termed 'biological essentialism' and was, at the time, considered was a form of radical feminism theory that had inverted itself and become patriarchal. At the time, the proponents were actually trying to attack the 'theft' of femininity promised by ... technology (the advancing reproductive science that seemed to be on the threshold of exo-wombs, embracing surrogacy, etc) and ... gay men (who were seen as, among a lot of other things, invading public consciousness space/dollars/political attention with their advocacy for civil and human rights, including the right to have families, adopt children, etc).  Third wave academic, activist, and intersectional feminists were exceptionally critical of this, seeing the recycling of language that had been used in the 80s to try and throw Black feminisms, Marxist and class-based feminisms, lesbianism and other expressions of feminism under the bus to preserve the limited advances that 'acceptable' feminism in Reagan-era white suburban USA had achieved. It was no coincidence at the time that the same women who had, only five years before had stood arm-in-arm with Republican televangelists in a crusade against sex-workers and pornography, or who had derided lesbian seperatist collectives as 'useless' (due to their 'rejection' of their biological purpose - i.e. squeezing out white babies for Jesus and America) were now rebranding themselves in the tropes of sacred womanhood.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Fun fact- last year after a super long flight and having a raging fever and a flu I got into a super verbally-aggressive debate with a co-worker who had the audacity to call a transgender woman who we met during that trip 'a monster'.

I spent most of my childhood around girls and adopting feminine mannerisms all because I couldn't handle being around other boys and they couldn't handle being around me!  I had no choice, but to hang out with the girls because at least my mannerisms didn't get me beat up, though that doesn't mean that I was completely accepted by the girls, either, and it doesn't mean that I wasn't still pressured to act more like a guy my entire life. Even to this day, I identify as a cis-gendered male, but, I don't feel comfortable with the social role of manhood.

"'Many trans women were feminine and queer before they transitioned, and have always experienced a kind of fem-phobia that is rooted in misogyny.'  God yes. This is why I didn't figure out my gender until I was an adult, instead of right when I hit puberty when the symptoms of dysphoria first started. Displaying any femininity at all, even unintentionally, would get me shit on by my entire peer group, so I just didn't explore my feminine side. I couldn't realize how good it felt to be feminine, because I was never allowed to try it out. This kept me in my egg for at least 5 extra years. I already had a lot of resentment towards my grade school experience and classmates, but this makes it so much more intense. I'd redo my life from 5th grade in a heartbeat if I got the chance. I could have started blockers and avoided the worst of male puberty if I had crushed all those toxicly-masculine shitheads instead of letting them walk all over me.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Wonderful work.  While I thought that the 'metaphysics' question was brushed aside too quickly, what came next was key: the moment when you talked about using the language of 'femininity' in order to be heard, to be seen -- but also, as you put it, in order to avoid having a shitty day.  Why not trade in ''''stereotypes'''' for personal and emotional reasons?  The world is hard enough, without having to deal with the things that don't matter.  Of course, trading in ''''''steroeotypes'''''' is what most people do, and we don't always find it so appealing.  The ethics of GUY-ville demands a lot of masculine conformity, and I bet for many boys, it's just easier to give it, in order to be seen.  But are the troubles of enforced (or toxic, ugh) masculinity exchangeable for comfort, no matter how deserved?   I suspect your answer came in a previous video -- raising issue not just of performance, but of masquerade.  In other words, is the price of using the language of femininity for security, visibility, comfort offset my putting lots of scare quotes around each word?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hey Natalie! First of all I have to say that I write this as someone who would be considered/has been called a TERF. I mildly engage in radfem tumblr, I read Sheila Jeffreys, and I mostly agree with a lot of concerns around trans issues that radfems have. Please don't block me yet, I am trying to engage in a #conversation. I love your videos, I am subscribed to your channel and while I don't agree with a lot of the points you make (particularly in videos like this or the other one about TERFs) I sympathize with them and understand where you're coming from. As someone who's been in the community, me and the radfems I am close with agree that most women who identify as such right now are just viciously transphobic, and too uncomfortable with the blurring of male and female identities for people who claim to be for 'abolishing gender'. Maybe these are the women who are the most vocal, or who interact with trans women the most, because they are moved by hate and not love. But I personally, like many others, understand the struggle of trans people (there are trans men and detransitoned people in the radfem community too) and I wish for there to be full rights and acceptance for them.  But I just don't understand why it should be at the expense of the women's rights movement.  I guess you personally are not against the celebration of the female body (the menstruator body?), but you can't deny that so many trans people and allies are. We've reached a point where vaguely politicized (cis) women are telling you that political demonstrations and art centering vulvas, uteri or menstruation are inherently transphobic and should be shut down. I really can't wrap my head around US being called the bigots in a situation where women's bodies are being erased.  Another issue that concerns me is the blatant lesbophobia and erasing of lesbian's desires. I can't tell you how many awful rapey comments I've read about this issue, how since dicks and maleness are entirely unrelated lesbians are transphobic for not wanting to be around them. Yeah, you can claim that that is not true and trans women *actually* mean blah blah blah, but there's so so many trans activists who genuinely think like that, and it has driven lesbian friends to deep depression, trauma about interacting with their much needed queer communities and self-hatred.  But my biggest concern is with the erasing of the very stuff that makes the patriarchy. Throughout history, and now specially in the third world, being born female is a death sentence. They don't ask you how you identify before mutilating (actually mutilating) your body in various ways, or marrying you to a man four times your age when you are a child, or before you suffer domestic violence in hands of the men in your family. These are thing that have been happening since the beginnings of society, and are still happening right now. Each second, in each country, there's a girl or a woman suffering because she was born female. I am extremely concerned with patriarchy's definition being changed to 'people who identify as men oppressing people who identify as women', or any other erasure of what this system of terrorism against female-bodied people is.  We are not a hate group, but we cannot trust trans activism if we have to ignore all of this. I don't think either of us is going to change our minds, but I wanted you to read about these issues that maybe are not voiced as loudly as the blatant transphobia some women call feminism. And I wish you would empathize with the things we are worried about, because it seems like nobody really cares about women, particularly lesbians, and what we have to say about our own oppression. As I said, I really admire you and your work, and I wish you a good life. I don't expect or want a response, but I didn't want these things to be left unsaid. Thank you if you read all the way.  PD.: Compulsory 'English is not my first language, sorry if I made any mistakes and please know that I probably didn't fully express myself as well as I wanted to' clarification.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is easily your most ignorant video. Masculinity and Femininity are not patriarchal constructs. They exist because of biology and the science is clear on this. Humans are a sexually dimorphic species and there are parallels between masculinity and femininity in every culture on Earth. Also, womanhood isn't oppressive. There is nothing wrong with womanhood and dressing girly and wearing makeup and having nails. This feminist idea that womanhood = bad and we should all be more like men is sexist and toxic to girls everywhere. Lastly, if you turly want people to be free then that's only going to INCREASE biological differences between men and women not make them go away. The more egalitarian a country is the more different the men and women in that country become.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The difference being that I actually do mean it in good faith, and not to eliminate trans people.

"As a non-binary person, I am deeply saddened by your take on gender abolishment, and the stream of comments (that I've mostly avoided) it has sparked complaining about people who with to live outside the construct of gender. There are some truly transphobic comments on this video that believe themselves validated by your opinion. You said yourself that there is no blue brain and pink brain. So why then, must our genitals be gendered? Why do  we signal to others what our genitals are and go around assuming the junk of others? Is it too much to ask for more people to be conscious of their assumptions and avoid them?  Gender is a construct of society, a lens that covers everything we see and do. Everything we study. We force the roles of female and male on plants, on insects, and asexual organisms. We force it on other people, and on ourselves. This construct of gender permeates every aspect  of human life and some people are sick of it. Of course you can't abolish gender in the complete sense. But we can start looking at things without the tint of gender on the lens. We can start looking at ourselves that way. And there is freedom in that. I expect this post to get all kinda of arguments and comments and I'm telling y'all right now I'm not reading them. I just hope Contra is able to open her mind on this a bit. This video breaks my heart and I know its going to hurt a lot of others too.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As someone who is a trans man, I still identify with a lot of the social problems that trans woman face. Which is this notion of not being manly enough, that my manhood is questioned because I am an unorthodox trans man. In which that because if my height and stature, I am not going to go out and achieve the impossible which is the hulking tall muscular man  [all though he exist just like the rad fem in my head space] - instead of being defeminized as these Terfs try to defeminize trans woman, I am often emasculated because I am not a man's view of manhood all though ironically a lot of these insecure men who question my manhood aren't the stereotypical ideal of manhood either. I have heard men question my manhood have more feminine cadence than I do. Self hating trans or gay men, I wonder. And it's infuriating as a trans man because I don't get the perks of male privileged because  I am emasculated out of it. And I don't get the privileges of womanhood either. A lot of us trans man, even when we are passing often feel like that Monster Gender Identity because get no solidarity from either gender.

"Abolishing gender doesn't mean that we all should be R2D2. You can still be masculine, feminine or whatever is your aesthetic it  just wouldn't be determined by your genitals.  And to call it a utopian project is not fair. Not that long ago people thought that convincing society to accept that men can be women is utopian project.  Imagine if you used all your influence and charisma to say 'fuck gender roles, i can dress and act however i want' With time and more exposure to gender non-conforming people society will understand that being born with a penis doesn't mean that you're aggressive and with no fashion sense and will stop believing in this restrictive roles. But we need you to stop claiming that because you're feminine - you're a woman. You low key admitted that you're throwing everyone under the bus, because abolishing gender is too hard, so you might as well make yourself comfortable even at the price of reinforsing those restrictive roles.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'll admit, as a young person I was skeptical of the whole transgender thing, until I actually MET someone who was trans when I was about 17. In that moment, face-to-face with someone who was so engaging and kind, how the hell could one not treat them with respect and understanding? By the end of the conversation, there was no question that I had met a fellow woman, even if they were 'clockable' as male-to-female at that time. I wonder how many TERFS would double down on their bigotry in a moment like that, and how many would buckle to the reality that - lo and behold!!! - Trans people are people too!!! and change their own mind and demeanor. At the end of the day, it takes a lot more mental energy to dehumanize people you don't know than to just stay in your goddamn lane, sweaty. Then again, maybe I'm assuming cis women are all sensitive, caring people deep-down with the inability to be hateful cunts and now I'M problematic.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Why, if she wants to 'abolish gender' does she feel such a need to protect women, and refers to the people around her as sisters? She's favoring them on terms of a concept she doesnt even want to exist!   Also loved the bit that proved that abolishing gender is impossible lmao!

"As a cis lesbian, one thing I've always thought was strange about the TERF argument is the idea that there's one unifying experience that makes you a woman. Womanhood is a vast, diverse set of experiences that can't really be boiled down to 'women are oppressed for having two X chromosomes', even among cis women. What being a woman means varies by race, class, sexuality, culture, disability, and a whole host of other things. OF COURSE trans women are going to experience misogyny differently from the way cis women experience it, because there isn't a solid 'female experience' to begin with.   As a lesbian, my experiences with misogyny are going to be different from a straight woman's experiences with misogyny. But I don't hear TERFs trying to claim that I'm not a 'real woman' because I don't have to deal with IPV from men.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"yeah im on the incongruity side of the argument...i isolate variables of gender and sexuality then put each variable on a scale between masculine and feminine. for instance the biological variables are Neurological, Biochemical, Anatomical, and Genetics, and for the sociological: cultural, Expression, internal view, External view, ect...Sociology is muddy. if their is a radical incongruity in the biological aspects you might be an Intersex, if there is an incongruity between the sociological and biological you might be trans....and now for me to say my radical positions  transsexuality is intersexuality, it is neurological incongruity because our sociological  aspects of self are a product of our neurology   don't @me 'biological realist'...because i is biologist","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"youre great Natalie. I just dont understand all of this. I was born and raised in the deep south by a very homophobic family. But I was a rather small boy and enjoyed being very feminine and crossdressing. I favored women. That invited much bullying growing up so I studied boxing and martial arts. The bullying quickly ended. I was a feminine boy who could quickly hand most of the jocks their ars back to them. It was very strange As an adult and trans topics cropped up on the scene. I did an amazing thing, totally earth shattering I educated myself on the topic. What is transexuality, what are they and how do they live. I read a few books on it, I read some indebth papers on the conditions and their experiences.  Why is this so difficult, anyone can do it. I even went to a few good youtube sites on it. One of my favorites was Zinnia Jones. She was very good at explaining the subject. And using that info to hand the bigots their arses back to them.  I learned it isnt their fault. One of the most ironic thing about Zianna was in her earlier videos where she just dressed femininely, she maintained that she is male. That changed later on, But she was a very young teen back then. Just discovering things. I wonder what ever happened to her.  I educated myself and learned everything I could. So I am freids with many of them and I do what I can to protect them here.  I just dont understand all of this hostility toward them. Just a few people trying to live their lives as best they can. Their condition isnt their fault. But what happened to them makes live almost unlivable in the condition they are in. So they must change why does that threaten so many other people","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Some of this rang very true to me. When I'd first understood that I was bisexual, I had already lived 17 years as a functioning and passing straight boy. Sure, I didn't pass all the time, often people would ask if I was gay and it felt invalidating on a level that was inexplicable to me.  Coming out I noticed that a lot of interest from women waned. Suddenly, friends who I had before discussed things civilly with would drunk dial me and ask personal and kind of insulting questions like 'Who is the girl?' whereas before I was treated like any other straight man.  Just because our socialization starts late, doesn't mean it doesn't happen.  And the worst was always that those insults, the attacks on my masculinity, the homophobic jabs, they hurt more because I knew they could be real. Being called a faggot wasn't just being called shitty, it was that I was attracted to men and that word meant me and my entire identity didn't mean shit if I admitted it to this person.  I knew gayer, more femme boys growing up and I've never disputed that they've had it hard, much harder than I did at the time. But in a lot of ways, coming out as bi will make it so you have it harder than being femme and straight or just being gay. Your prospects don't double, they half. Even the girls you're with will get paranoid about you having AIDS, and most of your partners question your faithfulness at some point.  And you will lose friends because, yeah, you tend to move politically left when you understand how little interest centrists and right wingers have in your well being. My old centrist friends will literally protest harder for someone else's right to call me a fag than for me to be allowed to donate blood.  Any way, TERFs can fucking leave, because duplicitous dipshits shouldn't get to share a space with the people they can and want to hurt the most.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think the most interesting thing about this video is the fact that not all trans experience is the same on the foundational level of egg state. Almost everyone I talk to speaks about how they always felt a certain way and that feeling made them emulate the gender they identified with. They'd then be 'corrected' which just made them feel more out of place. For them, they never were really the gender they were assigned at birth, but instead only 'played' at that gender to appease authority figures in their lives. For specifically my MtF peers it was more like woman playing man ala Much Ado About Nothing, only for the entirety of their pre-transition lives and with the extra limiter of being shamed for *not* wanting to 'act like a man' as opposed to *being* a woman.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hmm this was really interesting. I've always been of the 'destroy gender boundaries' mindset, but you bring up a really great point here... that it's just not practical to say that (esp. to trans people) when we live in a society... bound by gender boundaries. I also really like how when you introduced this topic you mentioned that this particular type of radicalization occurs when you have someone that has been introduced to feminism, but not trans-inclusive feminism. That is so incredibly true; for me, at least.   I had the experience of being raised progressively, going to a women's college, and coming to consider myself a feminist. I have been awed by the strength of the few trans-women and men I met in my life, without ever really *completely* believing that their 'state' was valid. It's a weird thing to admire but still completely fail to understand (or even really 100% believe) someone. I wasn't actively berating or even misgendering, but I admit there was always some irreconcilable hesitation in the back of my mind. I just couldn't reconcile 'gender as construct' and transgender ideology. All I ever really felt I could do was just throw up my hands and say, 'let them be as they wish,' it's their right. And I wonder how much hope there is for other people when even given all of my progressive bias, I couldn't get completely on side. I hope that reluctant acceptance will give way to a more complete and total acceptance in time, both within myself and within our society...   But in the meantime you've given me, and I'm sure many others, a lot to think on. So thanks for challenging us and for giving us more tools with which to challenge ourselves. And, as always, the execution was phenomenal.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's fascinating to me when terfs insist that all female children are degraded and traumatized horribly from birth for being female because... I transitioned at 14, when I was 13 I looked like a boy already, but 12 and under I looked like, acted like, and for all intents and purposes was a girl, and... that is not a good description of my experience of my childhood.  Like, I started getting a chest at 9 and I have never in my life been catcalled?  It's just not something that happened to me.  Which is not of course to say that it doesn't happen to other people--but it didn't happen to me, which contradicts the radfem/terf position.      //  Also I too tend to conceptualize myself as 'used-to-be-other-gender' rather than 'have-always-been-current-gender' and it's...

"Hey! Great video, but one of the comparisons I think could've used more research- most transmeds (such as myself) do not believe you need debilitating or constant dysphoria, only gender dysphoria in some measure! We generally also loathe TERFS, and though I don't want to get preachy or aggressive, personally I think the quote-unquote 'tucute' arguments have a lot more in common with TERF ideology. No hate, you are entitled to your opinion, just please display our beliefs accurately rather than caricaturising and, yes, strawmanning our beliefs.

"Ok no offence to anyone, I'm just gonna say my opinion on genders. I think that there are only 2 genders, I don't really understand the point of making new genders that fit with personality, but, I don't think people should be attacked for having different opinions and beliefs. If someone wants to transition, support them. If someone wants you to say their pronouns then say them, because I don't see how it would hurt you. Personally, I've never met anyone who is gender-fluid or trans, but I doubt I would treat them any different than I do with everyone else I know.   And I also want to say that contra points voice is really soothing, her videos are really well edited, and obviously a lot of effort are put in to it.

I identify as intergender now, but only because I remain unfeminine and know that I will forever. TERFs are bullies.

"i really don't comment much, but on the slim chance you see this, i wanna say a few things.    i saw this in a moment when my dysphoria was peaking. wonderful timing to watch a video about gender, eh? anyway. i don't know exactly how to describe it, but watching your videos on gender tends to soothe my dysphoria. i don't experience much in general, (transmeds smite me now) and most of it is social and due to my feminine presentation, so hearing you talk about the difference between expression and identity is always soothing. it's also nice because these arguments aren't coming from a cis ally, but a someone who has experience living as a trans person, (as a trans woman in particular, which also offers a perspective i don't have as a transmasc person) and because of that it feels more down to earth, even through the lovely costumes and lighting. it feels honest. it's not a person saying the right things to appeal to a certain group.    ive been watching you since you first started talking about your own gender in a time where i was questioning my own, and seeing you evolve in thought, experience, and composure is stunning. you're stunning. and also a massive source of inspiration, not because of your transition necessarily (though- holy crap) but through your well-reasoned, well-articulated arguments in the face of the projectile vomit that is transphobia.  all of this is to say- thanks. dunno if you'll read this, but thanks. for this video and all of them.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Wait, so the meaning of gender critical changed from people who are suspicious and critical of the concept of gender in general to, well, TERFs? It strikes me that they are the exact opposite of being critical of gender.  When did this happen, or did it always mean that? I seem to recall the literature being considered 'gender critical' if it was critical of the idea of prescribed gender roles and the expectation that to be considered a specific gender, you had to conform as closely as possible to masculinities or femininities. Ok, cool, I'm with it, so what label should we use for people who are critical of gender roles in general w/ an appreciation of androgyny? I mean, if TERFs coopted the term gender critical to mean something other than people who are critical of gender... Language is confusing sometimes.

"I often struggle when trans people talk about presenting or practicing womanhood or manhood. I'm genderqueer so the best ideal I have to look up to is ash hardell, and I like that they're getting recognition. But I don't relate to it, how can I 'practice and present my gender' when it's essentially a fluid version of masc and femme nonbinary needs. Not even a lot of trans men or women understand what being outside the binary is and for fucks sake neither do I, I have no role models, no history, no ideal to aspire to. It doesn't feel as much an exploration of the frontier as facing a post apacolyptic desert where everyone's claim is already staked and I'm left with nothing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I'll be honest in the hopes this gets buried and never upvoted, but I'm intersex, and while I never had any issue with trans people, I did and in some ways do find myself skeptical of the central premise. If someone came up to me and said they identified as intersex and wanted to change their physiology to match that, the very idea gets me furious, because I never saw 'intersex' as just an identity you can wear, it's a whole childhood and lifetime of specific experiences, almost none of them positive, that you simply can't understand if you're not born that way. I'm all for non-binary gender expression, but that is markedly different. I guess the trouble is there's no distinction in the English language between 'woman' as a gender identity and 'woman' as a creature you are born as and treated accordingly from birth. Being born intersex also forces you to think deeply about these things from an early age and from a non-trans perspective, as my genitals were not a man or a woman's but were cut up like a woman's and then I had to take hormones to make me look like a girl even if I wasn't sure if that's what I wanted but was considered what was best for me because I already had the vagina which was not really a vagina but there's nothing else to call it. But hey at least I'm not a menstruator and will never be a pregnant person, and that makes me both simultaneously not a woman and not trans but really I kinda am but not really.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"That Abolish Borders comparison is genius! Immigration has been the ABSOLUTE BANE of my existence (as a migrant child of migrants) and I am #1 Team Pro Abolish Borders forever, but that doesn't negate any of my activism and perspectives on how immigration and citizenship systems need to be much fairer and less hostile. As much as I'd like to set them all on fire, Immigration Departments still exist, and there are ways for them to do their job that isn't rooted in xenophobia and other forms of bigotry.  (Thankfully I've never met an anti-immigrant type using 'borders shouldn't exist anyway' as some kind of justification, but I do hear very similar rhetoric cloaked in the veneer of 'sustainability', 'gentrification', or 'overpopulation'. Leftists are not immune to xenophobia, and I say this as someone pretty far Left - I've found most of the super insidious xenophobia coming from the Left because it's hidden so well.)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'We're using a cultural language of feminine signifiers to prompt others to see us for what we are.'  Oh wow. I totally get that--I'm a cis woman, and what you just said is something I've thought about but never been able to parse in this way. I mean, being a woman is both a private experience and a public performance, and there can be a real disconnect between those two things. Often what is most significant about my experience of womanhood, like my actual values and experiences as a woman, cannot be heard, you know? Like, in a private conversation with another woman, those experiences are real, but, brought out in mixed company, or in public discourse, it's like those things can't be believed or acknowledged. Meanwhile, those feminine signifiers--not just makeup and clothes, but also behaviors, especially passive, conciliatory, or conformist behaviors--those things are how I communicate to the world, 'Hey, I am actual,' or 'Hey, I'm safe, so don't hurt me.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"A tactic worth flagging up that I've seen: the claim that autistic children are somehow being brainwashed by the pro-trans establishment to believe themselves trans, on the assumption that autism prevents kids from knowing best about their own gender identity.   Proportionally there do seem to be more autistic trans kids than neurotypical ones, but since nobody knows what causes either autism or non-cis gender identities, nobody knows why they correlate. You can speculate - divergences often do cluster, or autism makes you less receptive or more resistant to society's messages about gender, the list goes on - but brainwashing?  Well, that only works if you have another hidden prejudice under the guise of concern, or at least a misconception: the idea that autism equals totally clueless about everything related to being human. And if you know autistic people - my son is one, so are many friends - you'll know that's just not accurate.  But what this does is use 'concerned' hostility to autistic people as a weapon to discredit trans people. It's an ignorance twofer and it really isn't ok.  So if you hear that one, peeps, take it from one who knows: autistic kids are f%cking great, and like anyone else, they are the best authority on what it feels like to be themselves. Autism has its challenges, but recruitment by the Sinister Trans Brainwashing Conspiracy isn't one of them.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Unable to picture a future for myself. Being ashamed of who I knew, but couldn't accept, I was. Living in fear of which bone all the boys around me would break next. And living in fear that my parents, teachers or classmates would find out about me and that my ridicule would worsen tenfold. I never benefited from male privilege because I was too occupied with trying to figure out and escape root so that I could be the girl I knew I was. If fantasising about diving headfirst out a second story classroom window every single morning for three years is male privilege, then I guess I'm wrong and I did have it.

"I love Natalie's work, but I wish there weren't such a heavy feeling of irony around the Plath quote. Even with the mocking voice in which it was read, that passage brought tears to my eyes, just as it always does, because I can never recover from having freedom stolen from me because I am female. As a kid and teen, I wanted so much to roam outdoors, especially to explore the woods. It filled me with rage to see my younger brothers gain the freedom I couldn't have. I just wanted to go outside by myself, enjoy the silence; maybe say hello to another person, or maybe just learn to find my way around. I wasn't allowed. My female gender was the only reason. It's a completely normal experience. It's a completely standard, typical version of abuse, carried out by the entire world on all girls and young women. I understand that it might not seem like any great loss to someone urbane like Natalie, but I love nature. I love solitude and wide spaces, and I love deep silent woodlands, and reading aloud to myself under a leafy canopy, and I wanted to grow up doing those things, and I didn't, and I can never get that back.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"One of the most powerful political lines about the tampon tax is that it's 'A tax on being a woman'. Pedants have a problem with it and want to instead discuss the bodily process, which makes it seem less like an equity issue and more akin to awareness of a particular 'disease' in terms of framing.   If you saw 'A tampon tax is a tax on being a woman', would you agree with that or chime in with a 'well actually'? Conservative trolls do the latter.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

EDIT: After sitting through the whole video, I'm glad I watched it. I'm a very early transfemme/nonbinary/labrador retriever who struggles a lot with the things Natalie spoke about regarding male privilege and socialization, and the impact they have on my 'womanhood'. As she said, most trans people do NOT want to talk about these things because so often it is a weapon wielded against us, but the fact is the points are in my head constantly.  It was pretty satisfying to see them laid out and discussed in a more nuanced way than would ever be kosher in either the trans or TERF circles.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
