"I remember the first time I saw Tiffany's little breakdown at the end of the video. It was not long before my bottom surgery and I felt really bad about my body and the words resonated with me super hard.  I'm nearly 5 months post op and even though that is still hard for me to watch it doesn't resonate with me in the same way anymore. Progress.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Jesus this is not that complicated. There's a whole section of straight men that are into what used to be called shemales or whatever it's called now. So like you look like a perfectly hot woman but you've got a big dick. I'm assuming it's part of the whole perversion is hot part of the human brain (I'm into different perversions). They are straight if you're desperate to label them as in they're not attracted to men and they are attracted to girls without penises, just not as much. Also thanks for telling me what a trap is, never knew. Some drunk men will accidentally hit on a trans women and then freak out when they realize their mistake and because lets be honest they probably are idiots they might think it means they're gay and since their entire identity hangs on the probably, in their case, thin strand of their masculinity they get violent. Just like guys who beat up gay men for flirting with them instead of just labeling it like a compliment and moving on.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"For my entire life, I've been a very progressive person.  I've always been all for not invalidating people's right of existence, be it they're gay, trans, or whatever where society makes them feel this self disgust you presented. However, that breakdown of Tiffany touched me in a way I've never felt before. I don't know what it is about the excecution of it, but I felt it, for what might be the first time, I felt just a fraction of what people are made to feel everyday, just because they exist. If anything, it strengthens my resolve against transohobia and other related issues, so thank you. It's been an eye opener, even to 'someone like me'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Tiffany's breakdown brought me to tears - I know it was dramatised but I still felt raw empathy for her. I think everyone has gone through wishing they weren't they way they were at some point, and I definitely connected with that. But the realisation of the often sheer magnitude of this struggle with self acceptance for trans people broke my heart. I knew of it before, but this made me really feel it. I'm tearing up again just writing this comment.. Thank you Contrapoints for such a thought provoking video. Your content continues to seriously impress and move me, so thank you.  PS. I am a straight (for the most part), white, cis male. I am finding many subtly held views of mine that I often didn't realise I was harbouring continually challenged by this channel. And I love it. Just if people are interested to know.  PPS. Contrapoints is automatically recognised as a word by Google android keyboard. And I love that too :D","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I assume the purporse of the video is to show how the supposedly woke right-leaning trans woman is suffering and what her internal conflicts are, and this is then supposed to mean that this isn't a good way for a trans woman to exist. However, it would be naive to think that the other tran in the video has it any easier or that she isn't facing identical issues in her own distinct way. I don't think this video has a clear conclusion, and I also don't think it needs one.  I say all this while being aware that this is, at this point, a relatively old video, and that a lot has happened since.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There's something deeply disgusting about this. I get that your presenting it as being about internal self hatred but if it really was a discussion about that it would do something to help people who legitimately felt self hatred over being transexual. Instead it paints them as deeply pitiful souls and reduces everything they could say to being about appearing in a way they can be granted acceptance. At first this made think this was  just a shady hit piece on Blaire White with good production value, but when I also think about your political values compared to the ones shown by the girl in the video I feel like it's just a method of devaluing a trans person's opinions that dissent with your own. Shouldn't really be surprised though, as no one seems to be able to talk about these issues without doing that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I feel like with an emotional video like this I can finally explain some of the struggles that trans people face to my family.   I also feel like I can use this to explain how internalized the concept of gender is and why it's important to stop it from guiding all of your judgements. I'm non binary (assigned male at birth) and my mom 'supports me no matter what' but when I put on a shirt with flowers on it that I loved, while everyone else loved it, she said it 'looks too flowery.' With this video showing how problematic it is to encourage gender stereotypes, I feel like she might just see that shirt as a shirt that looks really good on me!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Back here after six months. I broke out crying during the last scene where Tiffany is crying and lamenting about her appearance and general depression. Feeling unloved, undeserving, inadequate and disgusting. As if you're trying to mock something you will never be. I used to project against transgender issues and it's community for such a long time. When I realized I was Queer in general the self-hate intensified until I landed in the hospital for the fifth time after trying to take my life. Something about it was different and I decided to try to explore what was causing me so much pain.      I have always been 'masculine,' I don't know what exactly that means. Ever since I was a child Id simply want to play with the boys, dress like them and be with them. Everything about their lives and wanting to belong intrigued me. Up until I was twelve I didn't realize that I didn't want to just be friends with them. When I first began puberty I experienced an immediate disconnect to my body. I didn't love it, I didn't want it. When it came to fapping I would imagine I had a penis and could only get off then or imagine I was touching another woman which sent me into a gay panic as I was extremely and hopelessly attracted to women. I tried to focus on every slight male attraction I had to make myself 'straight-ish,' at the very least. I tried/try to convince myself that I'm just a tomboy. But once you wake up wanting to cut off your breasts and magically grow a penis and cry about it in your sleep or even just try to turn yourself 'off' when you're having sex because It just feels otherworldy... I just didn't understand why this was happening. This happened before I even had any real interaction or information with/about being trans.     After so many painful years of being in the closet in general... I wanted to go ahead and dabble with the idea of being a trans man. However, that really didn't work out for me because I only seemed to get worse mentally.    As of now, I'm about to be 20 and well, I'd say I'm genderqueer but the truth is I'm really just terrified to say what I feel like I am... I have never allowed myself to date women and whenever I try to tell my boyfriend about what I feel like he expresses that he wouldn't want to be in the relationship anymore which is rational, he's a straight man after all... I don't want to lose him. I'm in a very scary spot in my life and this is terrifying to even write. My family would disown me, I don't think I'd be able to fathom transitioning, I would lose so much. I'm too scared to try.     But Natalie, thank you for opening the bag I didn't wanna touch for so long. Thank you.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The only thing I don't seem to agree with you on out of all your videos is about Muslims. Muslim is intertwined with Islam. Ya, perhaps most are Arab but there's a racist reason for that, which is that Islam is racist. Even the founder of Islam Muhammad himself was apparently racist against black Africans, and didn't care for Jews. And apparently nothing's really changed on that front in 1,400 years either, since there's an actual slave trade in Libya, women are still slaves in most of their countries, and Israel is constantly under attack from other ME countries that just so happen to be Muslim.  Anyway apparently I'm racist too, because I have a fear of Islam over most religious ideologies and put it at the same level as natsees. And if Muslim=Islam and Muslim is a race then ok, it applies to a race I guess, and I have to accept my Muslim racism rather than be a hypocrite. *shrugs*","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"When Jackie Jackson went off on Tiffany  Contrapoints is when Natalie makes her central point: because Tiffany Tumbles's presentation of transgenderism fails to challenge the status quo or at least ask the status quo to genuinely accept the dignity of transgender persons, Tiffany Tumbles can never be truly accepted by those who benefit from the status quo.  Merely commenting upon her personal decision to undergo plastic surgery to appear more like a woman immediately threatens the status quo and jolts awake lingering and unresolved transphobia.  Unlike a 'genuine woman' who may choose to undergo plastic surgery, an 'individual who has chosen to identify woman'''s decision to undergo the same procedure is suddenly a bizarre outsider succumbing to 'backwards social norms' and 'not truly understanding what it means to be woman.'  Tiffany's outsider-status is maintained if she doesn't demand that the world doesn't truly and honestly accept her as a woman.  And she fails to realize that unless the demand is made, they never will.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Like a few other trans commenters here, I spent years trying to be Tiffany Tumbles - find a way that I could get cis people to accept me. I knew it was even harder since I was nonbinary. I was so desperate to get cis validation that I did awful things to other trans people and justified it with 'well I'm trans, so it's okay'. I thought transtrending was real, I spent so much time invalidating others to try and validate myself. I'm only watching this now towards the end of the journey of casting off those views, after I've realised how awful they are and how even in doing everything awful I did, the cis people I was trying to validate not only never would, but were *using* my transness and nonbinary-ness to shield themselves from criticism.  I know this is another comment flung into a sea of similar comments, but I think it's an excellent video to show folks who may be in the same position as I was, since it does mirror those experiences so well.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Honestly I feel like both Adria and Tiffany both have valid ideas and maybe both have flaws in their techniques. I'll start with Tiffany her good idea is to bring the further right people in slowly or to explain things like one would to a child. Her flaw is her need to fit in that is so deep that she will say whatever happens to be conservatively correct because that is her observed normal. I can relate on some level to that as before I actually understood all the nuances to the more liberal arguments they seems quite ridiculous to me. Now I think Adria's validity in ideas should be pretty self evident as making sure to say it as it is and being honest is definitely a valid way to go. The issue that may or may not actually be there with Adria though is that she doesn't seem to get that simply shutting down conversation is a bad thing. I went for so long wanting to find some conversation so I could understand where the modern SJW ideology came from but all I could find were either videos that explain assuming I already understood much of what they wanted to say and people who I tried to find online to have a conversation with simply ignore me. I would have been able to see why so many of these ideas were good if someone simply took the time to explain it in depth but most places and people just won't. Also that's why your channel is so amazing because it explains so much of what I needed to know and while I still don't 100% agree on everything I can find myself agreeing to some extent.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I feel for Tiffany as a Transman. Everything she said about being accepted was exactly how a felt, even down to her views. I felt like I had to do all of that to be accepted and its exhausting.

In context, a transphobe just my guild in WoW and I had to continue my mask of 'Im not like one of those other transpeople. Nothing offends me.' This guy called me out in front of the entire guild, refusing to call me Alec or he. Saying its he's believe and 'I shouldn't be attacked for calling a girl a girl' No one would come to my aid, because no one saw this as an attack. I eventually went to an officer and he had the nicest thing I have ever heard 'Someone says happy Hanukkah to me it isn't going to kill me to say it back just because i don't celebrate that holiday thats what I don't understand. I wont pretend like I understand all of it. There is no way I could. But I try. It isn't hard and anyone who cares about it enough to voice an opinion like that isn't worth my time or yours. I can't change other peoples beliefs or opinions but I do know that whatever you believe it should not affect how you treat other people and if he treats people like that it is his attitude and personality not his beliefs to blame' I had never had someone that understood, I felt so stupid because I cried. I had someone who fully understood me without me having to bend over backwards to show I'm normal. This guy was kicked after one more comment.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm an NB SJW who has cis privilege, and really, people who don't experience dysphoria or the oppression one experiences when transitioning need to stop claiming legitimacy to speak for all trans issues.   For a long time I was the only leader of the disability and mental illness subgroup of a major trans activist organization in  my city.  The rules were supposed to be that every subgroup have 2 leaders who were both trans, and at least one should be POC.  My co-leader, who was a black trans man, stepped down a few weeks after the formation of the group, because of school and his personal life.  No one else felt qualified to be one of the leaders, before or after this happened and that privilege is a big reason why. Most of our members were brand new to activism and hadn't attended a protest before. I have never had to worry that if I'm arrested protesting, I'd end up a lone woman in a male jail cell.  Most of them couldn't commit to attendance at every meeting because if they didn't have a ride they had to take public transit, sometimes after dark, and couldn't be sure they could do this without getting murdered. This is somewhat not an irrational fear for anyone AFAB, but it isn't so consuming that I can't take transit, and besides, I didn't need to, because I had a car that I payed for with my job where I went by my preferred gender-neutral name with no issue because I told them it was just my nickname.  Throughout the whole process I continued to tell the other leaders of other subgroups that I self identify as non-binary but not trans, that I was a trans ally filling this position only until someone more qualified could make the time commitment, and was met with constant denial and told that I don't need dysphoria to be allowed in trans-only spaces, was offered trans-only subsidized housing that I turned down, having to explain that we all have a housing crisis but I'm not actually facing housing discrimination. The worst trans-related oppression I ever have to experience is being annoyed that strangers keep calling me ma'am. But since I'm leader of the disability group (and do actually have mental illnesses) I continued to be the one all the other leaders referred people to when their dysphoria got so bad they felt suicidal and the NT's got all freaked out and scared they couldn't handle it.  I was the one who was supposed to know where you can go to get help for legitimate mental illness without it being used to deny your right to transition.  I don't know. And whether or not I get to include myself in the trans umbrella isn't the biggest concern I have for the trans community right now.    In no way does this make it okay for white trans women to suddenly decide racism is the solution to everything, but being called an awful truscum transmedicalist for demanding these issues take up more of the focus than the constant reiterations of 'you're valid and your identity is valid and always make sure you ask and don't assume pronouns' and celebrating deviating from gender norms that seems to take up all of trans social media, well. That's a real thing.  And it's leaving many trans people without a community to turn to.  If they were gonna become trump supporters as soon as they felt alienated anyway, no great loss, but those aren't the only trans people we're abandoning either.  If you're not cis and you don't struggle with access to hormones, life-threatening dysphoria, being murdered by your lover, or the fear of being incarcerated in a facility for the wrong gender, you should really prioritize fighting for the people who do face those things","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

She's eaten the Red Pill (is that what you call it?) but she pretends she hasn't, and would rather be society's lapdog for her own gain.

I find myself usually agreeing, or if not, at least respecting the nuances and layers you peel back on the issue you're examining.  And the viciousness and darkness of your sense of humour resonates with me pretty strongly.  This video, however, was something else entirely.  It starts as a Contrapoints video-- ok, so I guess rather than just vlogging, we're gonna start with a dramatization before we get to the meat and potatoes of the issue.  No problem, she's done that before.  The narrative teasers she writes are usually pretty funny.  Instead, the video just... _commits_ to being a narrative rather than a vlog, and... Holy Shit.    You are an extremely talented filmmaker and storyteller.  That sometimes is not totally clear from the teasers on your other videos.

The eye-mind stimuli are very important for the erection (performance anxiety is an example), so if you are sexually attracted from a 'female penis' is not usual, so it's a sort of deviation. And that's ok: i think the problem here is not if you are 100% straight or not, but that people meddle in other people business. I like what i like and that's not your business.

"I think you really encapsulated exactly what goes through the head of so many people. I've often wondered if I'm being 'too' gay or 'too' brown, and then a day or two later decided that it doesn't matter whether I'm 'too much' for everyone, and then a few days later found myself policing myself and my own expression because I don't want to 'scare people away'. I'm coming to terms with being a non-binary, trans-masculine person and the thing that stops me from stepping out of that closet is all the questions I'm going to get, the judgement, it's all just too much for me to deal with. The worst part is just not having the answer to all those questions that people have. There are many days I really wish I was just 'normal', but I pretty quickly realize I can't even imagine myself being anything other than myself. One of the things of this story that really struck was the strength it took Tiffany Tumbles to pull herself off the floor after having a huge meltdown, somehow putting herself back 'together', and facing the world for one more day. I'm sure that's something a lot of people can relate to. It's definitely something I've done on quite a few occasions. The strength it takes to face everything, especially when you're alone in this world, is enormous. Facing your demons, maybe not finding the answers, and somehow getting up to keep going, that's a visceral process I can understand.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"All this video has taught me is that the cosmetics industry is a psychosocial plague on the world.   Seeing Natalie pre-makeup was pretty jarring, but watching the timeslip of her applying her makeup to completion (where she now, in the usual social sphere, 'passes' for female) made me realize that my emotional reaction to pre-makeup Natalie is bullshit.  That society has successfully implanted in my mind that, visually, women need to be dolled up in cosmetics in order to pass (not to mention look even 'presentable' in the public) just feels......... insidious and unfair to women, that they're forced to carry this social pressure while men just need basic hygiene practices and not-ratty clothes.   This applies to my mother and aunties as well, whose pre- and post-makeup faces I've seen countless times, but even during the times I'm facing them pre-makeup, that societal dissonance keeps buzzing in the back of my head, that awareness that 'These women aren't wearing makeup, and it feels WEIRD to see them like this.'  I can't believe I can even feel this way towards my own family.  If I can feel this way towards my own family, then how fucked up is it for women in general to be surrounded by this social message?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Wow this cut deep. Tiffany was so wrong and problematic, but you made her so relatable. That moment Adria told Tiffany she wasn't gaining acceptance for anyone but herself really stuck with me...  I'm from Bulgaria. The LGBT community here has the same representation problem this video highlights. We have no real media representation outside hetero-accepted stereotypes, so the only way we get it is by being out in our real lives and influencing the people around us to actually consider the LGBT community. Generaly speaking, most bulgarians have the 'keep it at home' mentality about everything non-cishet. Enter Sofia Pride or what passes for a pride parade in Bulgaria. It usually has about 2000 young, white, gays and lesbians (don't think I've ever seen a trans person). Every time it comes around the media explodes with comments 'I don't mind gay people, but why do they have to have a parade/shuv it down my throat' and 'How will I explain this to little Goshko!'. A lot of LGBTQ+ people don't attend the parade and want it to stop it from happening, because they believe it's overexposure and that it ruining our image and halting progress.  It's toxic internalised homophobia, of course, but it's hard not to empathise with them a little bit. I mean, when Pride's not happening people sort of forget about the LGBT community and we sort of do what we want, but when it rolls around, people get their pitchforks. It's easy to look at Pride and say 'What are you even proud of? Just shut up and let things happen on their own, you attention seeking gnats! We were doing just fine!'. Basicly, they want acceptance, but don't want to fight for understanding. They don't want to get their hands(and image) dirty, because it's easier to be a cishet lapdog.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think that it might be because I'm trans but even when I look back at old contrapoints videos from before she came out I cant see her as anything but female. like its a combination of me being trans and me having first seen her videos where she's a woman, but idk man. its so weird to watch this and know that tiffany is her worst impulses distilled and imbibed with some racism, and to think that she feels bad about herself when I can only think of her in the feminine no matter how far back i go in the videos. but at the same time, I also think that way about myself sometimes, like as too girly, or too big of tits. is this a universal thing that trans people experience, seeing other trans people as perfect and always their actual gender but questioning yourself at every turn? is this what we are doomed to be? affording other trans people the courtesies that we would kill to be able to afford ourselves.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's interesting how in the US, we all ignore the history of gender in non-western cultures (many of which saw gender and gender expression in non-binary nor simplistic ways). So in a wayyyy, by erasing the many different cultures that see gender as non-binary or fluid, you are kinda being racist. And since being trans has been a part of human history since nearly the start of what we can see, that includes transphobia. So yeah. I wouldn't say someone's automatically racist for being transphobic but they're definitely uneducated and ignorant in numerous ways.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've been marathoning your videos all day (seen a lot of clips before and follow a lot of people who love your work, but never sat down to watch a full video before), and this is just... incredible. The whole sequence at the end from the breakdown and graphic novel depiction onward was viscerally intimate. The way it jumps from that full breakdown to sitting in front of the mirror and doing the sped-up full beat was absolutely captivating, I literally could not look away from the screen until the credits rolled.  I did a quick glance through the comments and didn't see anyone else mention this, but my stomach absolutely dropped out from 14:17 because between the dim light outside and the music and where Tiffany was walking, I thought something really bad was going to happen to her on the way home. I almost can't describe how sharp the moment was between 'watching a video and enjoying the content' to 'oh god no please don't let this go the direction my gut is feeling', and then to a sense of total relief that she made it home safely.   You do such a good job of fleshing out these characters and making me want to roll my eyes and yell at them one second and pull out my 'protect other women at all costs' instinct the next. I cannot commend you enough for the powerful and important work you're doing with your art here.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Sorry, I'm late to the party, you may not even see this @ContraPoints. Very funny and thought provoking video.  But I have one (and it is just one) quibble...  I think there is problem with framing internalized bigotry and self loathing as vehicle or seed of external bigotry and loathing. It is very possible for people to be fully accepting of themselves and their innate qualities AND just be bigots.  For me 'AS a GAY MANNN' I think of the late Fred Phelps and his family. They just hate(d) gay people gay men in particular.There is no evidence that they hated themselves or their identities as Christian, White people ect.  You can also note ISIS, when they exterminate gay people. They hate gay people and kaffir because of their ideology, I think it would be hard to argue that they do so because of some kind of internalized hatred towards themselves.   I'm not saying that the video is incorrect. Lots of people do externalize their internal hatred. I'm just offering food for thought.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I'm transitioning atm, and count myself extremely fortunate to come from a moderately wealthy white background in the UK.  I haven't experienced a lot of the horrible things being reported by much of the rest of the international trans community, which has meant that whilst I understand the mental struggle, the social struggle is a bit of a blindspot - I want to know more so I can help more, and I'm sure that's the case for many other trans people in my position.

"As Me being a cis man, the part where she exclaims that she 'mutilated herself' was simply heartbreaking. It's sobering to realize that many trans women probably genuinely feel this way towards themselves, since dysphoria about one's own gender is difficult to get over, since even when you do 'fix' all the things that made you feel horrible, you might find soemthing else that you're not satisfied with, a la 'I fixed my nose but now my brow stands out'.  It also kind of goes that way for cis people, to some _much lower and less extreme extent,_ when we dislike our appearances. For example, I generally don't like my facial structure (because I'm pretty effeminate in body shape aside from the biggest bone structure differences like my shoulder/waist ratio) so I decided to grow my hair out. But now my hair goes down well past the middle of my back, and I find something else to hate, like my almost complete lack of facial hair.  Basically, what I'm trying to say in a really awkward way is, this video spoke to me in a way I wouldn't expect a video about internalised transphobia to do, which is eye-opening for a cis person who really wants to be an ally.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Tbh, while I'd 'supported' trans women in a 'queers gotta stick together' kinda way, I never really understood them. Meeting Adria in this video actually made it click for me. Previously, all my exposure to trans people had been Tiffany types on TV, and as a tomboy, I'd never much related to that kind of woman, cis or trans. Tiffany types seemed to me like a male idea of what women should be, and I always secretly wanted to ask trans women, 'If you're saying you're a woman, then why are you dressing like a man's idea of a woman?' But Adria actually seemed like a real woman to me, like a woman I would actually be friends with. She was relatable. While watching her, I was like 'OOHHHHH there are different kinds of trans women, I've just been seeing super femme types on TV because TV always pushes femme women, cis and trans.' Sounds obvious now.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Seeing Tiffany's struggles with dysphoria actually brought a tear to my eyes.  I'm raised in a very conservative country but have had a pretty liberal thought process since high school because I figured out I was bi. I however had been a lot less accepting of trans people until last year.   I'm ashamed of my mentality back then and while I now I can never fully understand the struggles of trans people, I have a little more insight into how much dysphoria affects them as well as transphobes attitudes.

Say you are Christian, you'll find immense variety in the types of Christian people.  Same thing.  It's insane.  I am a white straight male (born male, with man dick haha) , but I have some bisexual desires and a feminine part of myself.  Probably nothing could describe and label me accurately in words.  I relate to the confusion Tiffany experiences in some ways, (but also not).  Basically I'm never totally satisfied and comfortable with who I am.  It's hard to pick a path in life.  I'm currently aiming for a monogamous straight marriage and family with kids, it feels like my realest truth, more true than any other path, but there is still some doubt and confusion.  I'm currently very interested in masculinity and being a man, and I'm a huge Jordan Peterson fan too.  I watched your Jordan Peterson video, this is how I found this channel.  You made some good points about JP.  There is a lot that I don't know what to think about JP, but a lot that I still like.  I think he offers a ton of good for people.

It took me years to come to terms with the fact that I simply am transgender. As a formerly right wing trans person, you really did hit close to home with how we had wanted to be what cisgender people consider as 'normal' and to show that we aren't 'like the triggered SJWs'.

"I don't know if you'll read this because it's a little bit of an older video and you get a lot of comments anyway, but I had a question! You take a position against traps as transphobic in this video, and say that it's been used as a slur against you. I have always considered traps and trans women to be two separate concepts, defined as opposites by the unobjectionable fact that traps identify as male but trans women identify as female.  Traps, like futanari (girls with big dicks), represent one or both of two sexual concepts. The first is a safely expressed attraction to male sexual characteristics - even though you like looking at the penis and thinking about sexual activity with someone with a penis, the person is still presenting as female and thus your sexual identity is protected. This is the essence of the 'trickery.' It's not that those darn trans woman are making me like dick, it's the taboo nature of liking dick but being 'forced' into it by someone who takes advantage of your 'real' attraction to women. You can consider traps as thus a step on the way to ending transphobia and homophobia because they allow straight men to express their sexuality and thus not feel as threatened or confused by queer people. Trapping is really about protecting your sexuality, not so much about genderbending.  The second fetish concept is that the penis is a large part of male sexual development. It's the source of good feelings and sexual bliss, and cumming is an obvious sign of arousal and enjoyment. Translating the penis onto a women allows men to combine those contradictory aspects of their sexuality. You can look at male trap fetishes as similar in concept to the idea of making women 'squirt,' because men grow up associating orgasms with ejaculation, which becomes confusing or dissatisfying when they learn that women don't orgasm as visibly or distinctly. A futa or trap, on the other hand, has a predictable, and thus comforting, sexual expression. Again, this is a part of men expressing sexuality and not feeling threatened or confused. This one is actually debatably more healthy for queer representation than the previous because the futa or trap in this one identifies as female. The only issue is that it leads to expectations of sex with a trans girl as being different from sex with a woman, when in actuality sex with a trans woman is pretty much just anal with a woman. HRT makes pee pee no worky so good, and gender dysphoria means that a trans woman is not going to WANT to ejaculate or have you treat her genitals like a penis instead of a big ol clitoris.  You can talk back and forth about the dubious morality or positivity behind turning transgender women and cross-dressers into sexual objects for male pleasure, and whether THAT is transphobic or not. As a man, I don't think it's avoidable. You can fight against hatred, and you can fight against confusion or misinformation, but fighting love? I'm not sure that one is possible.  Remember that this is just in reference to the very specific fetish of someone who presents as female but has a working penis (futanari in the case of identifying as a woman, trap in the case of identifying as a man, trans girl in real life). Trans women are not traps, and anyone who calls a trans woman a trap is being real stupid.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I can't even imagine how hard that must be. I still date men and I am in a heterosexual relationship but there's nothing like that for trans people. Perhaps only other trans people.   If it makes any trans people in the comments feel any better, I've met a trans man and a trans woman and I saw them both as the gender they expressed. The trans woman was a bit obviously a trans woman, and a bit of a diva, but I saw her as a woman. The trans man was the mother of someone I know, and he looked like a man so much that I thought he was her father.  He was quite handsome too. I was wondering whether or not his penis worked but I don't think that would matter to me in a relationship tbh.

But now that this is kind of more well-defined for me, it just ends up being a question if I have the bravery to explore my attraction to trans women to that extent! :D","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm a new subscriber to this channel, watched about 3 videos before this one. I'm not like Tiffany Tumbles at all but thanks to the power of your acting, I felt how she feels and sympathized with her and Adria and got to understand a community I really know nothing about. I know like 1 trans person that I'm aware of, a woman, and this gives me an idea of some of the work and emotional pain it takes just to be who you want to be.  Also I kinda related to a lot of the 'I hate my body' speech even if I'm not trans, just because up to there is kind of how I feel about myself vs the work I should put into taking better care of my own body.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

";(  This really got to me... I've been so upset with how trans people get treated, especially since Trump.  I'm an agendered lesbian woman, but I did consider transitioning to male for a while before I ultimately realized that I'm pretty much equal parts of both genders.  I've gotten lots of casual bigotry over my life for how I dress and carry myself, but the stuff trans women put up with is just horrific.   I don't understand why some cis people care so fucking much!  Trans people aren't doing anything to them, they're just trying to live their lives and get along, but cis bigots are just being insecure little babies who can't cope with someone who lives life a different way than they do.  I can't wait until humanity grows out of it.  And god, the trans and gay people who've internalized so much shame and self hatred that they act like Tiffany... I remember seeing a vid of Blaire White with Ben Shapiro, and he was talking about how he believes she's still a man right in front of her, and the look on her face was just heartbreaking!  How can he have so little empathy?!  It's not that hard to treat people with basic respect and human dignity!  Also, that makeup routine is amazing!  You're super good at it :) and gorgeous... I may have a low-key lesbian crush on you, lol.  This was an amazing video, and it makes me happy to see so many comments from people saying that you changed their minds!

"Yo Fuckin You can't just say 'I refuse to be a victim.' I mean you can if you're willing to be demonstrably wrong, but this is just a ridiculous mindset. Can someone who has been hit with a baseball bat claim truthfully that they are not a victim of assault? Can someone who has just been racially profiled claim that they are not a victim of racial profiling?  I get the urge. I get the need to be in control of your life. I really want to be in control of mine. I get the wish to believe that everything you experience is below you, and that you control it. This leads to awful self-doubt and self-blame, though. It leads you to hurt others.  It's not a bad thing to be a victim, or to 'play the victim' if you've experienced something awful. It's not a bad thing to speak out about your experience.

"Otokonoko means boy in Japanese. In anime and in otaku culture otokonoko describes pretty much the same thing as the word trap does in the English language. It's not really the same as trans or a cross dressing man (otoko no musume in Japanese), it describes a non transe young man or boy who looks exactly like a woman when crossdressing but is 100% biological male, hence the name 'trap'. No one would call a post op trans woman a trap (though it's arguable whether she should disclose her biological gender before dating someone. To me it's not really important, but for some people it is, and I can fully understand why they'd think such information is important and I don't believe this has anything to do with transphobia), but a biological male pretending to be a female and not disclosing his true gender to potential dates or hookups is the definition of what a trap is in this context.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Your set design, production quality, costumes, special effects, music, acting, your characters, EVERYTHING is perfect. These kinds of videos of yours are my favourite, when you're portraying two or more characters having a debate. You're not just someone talking to a camera (even though when you do I love it all the same) you are showing the good, the bad, and the grey areas of things I would have never even thought of. Like, the feminine penis part. Seriously, why is no one talking about the feminine penis? I'm extremely excited to show my best friend these videos, I've been friends with him since 2007 and been with him throughout his transition, and really wanna get his opinions and point of view. I know for a fact he will find this as interesting as I do.  Also, the scene at the end with Tiffany makes me cry.

"I don't disagree that a trans woman with a 'feminine penis' is a woman.  I'm just curious about how we describe genital preferences now.    I think rightly so, we are conceptualizing gender independent from genitalia, but people are still attracted/unattracted to specific genitalia.  It seems to me that it's similar to general body preferences, except that I'd want to say that a person is superficial for being closed off to a relationship with someone of a certain height, facial structure, or ethnicity, but I do not (at present) think it unreasonable to be exclusive about genitalia. Is it reasonable for a person to rule out feminine-penis possessing partners?  Maybe because genitalia, unlike other attributes, are essential and constitutive components to certain kinds of sexual experiences?    I'm still confused because sexual experiences seem very tied up with the concept of sexual orientation, which I'm used to talking about along gender lines, but we've said that genitals don't determine gender.  So... genitals are part of a cluster-concept of gender just like any other physical gender-marker except perhaps that genitals have a bit more weight?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I thought I was the rational trans guy who wasn't one of those crazy SJW types. When I saw this video though, it really struck a chord somewhere. I saw myself in Tiffany and it made me... Sad. It was hard to take that look at myself, in a way, and to see someone else act out how I had felt so many times before. I had started to reconsider what I thought I had known. While I still catch myself thinking 'oh great, this person is going to make us look bad again,' I have tried to be better. Thank you for this video.

"I just wanted to say... I deal with MDD (Major Depressive Disorder) and I can say, that scene where Tiffany wishes she was different, drunk, crying on the floor; I have been there, but I'm not transgendered. I guess I just wanted to say that, it's crazy that no matter what the angle, deep internalized depression and self-hatred looks quite the same outwardly.  It's okay to have suicide hotline on your phone. It's okay to ask anonymous lines for help.  It's tough when it's internalized. Sometimes it's like you are hating the only person you have; yourself. And that type of isolation mixed with loathing and sorrow is painful af.  Wish I could have a good answer for it, but I don't.  I just wanted to say it's a relatable feeling, even if our ways to get there are very different paths.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm confused about ContraPoint's view on what constitutes being a particular gender. In another video she says that there is more to gender than what one identifies as - she says gender is social and one's appearance and performance are relevant.   I'm having a hard time working out where the idea of a female penis fits in. If a penis can be female when it's owner identifies as female, lives their life as female and otherwise appears female, can any karyotypically male trait be female under the right circumstances? If so, then someone who looks like a man, lives their life as a man but identifies as a woman is a woman. This seems in tension with ContraPoint's previous video. It seems that to resolve this tension there needs to be a line somewhere? Sorry for being long winded. Can anyone help me out here?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"while i definitely don't think trap is gay what i hate the most about that argument is how it cirlces the word gay way back into -a thing- (it may not be explicitly negative but it does imply it's scanadalous in some way), even if i went with it and let it be that trap is gay then let's just go ahead and bring everything that is not undeniably heteronormative into the gay sphere then, you don't understand women and love your gf less than your homies?? uh.. GAY. you saw a hairstyle or an outfit on someone else and you liked it so you decided to try it for yourself? you did it to look more attractive and that means you thought that same gender presenting person was attractive AND THATS GAY. you know a het couple who you think are great together and you totally understand why they love each other?? uhm if you're appreciating anyone that does not comform to your hetness in any wasy or context THEN IT'S KINDA GAY U KNOW. you want the happiness and acceptance for a same-gender friend or think they would be an improved version of themselves if they were more like you??

I am trying to share my experience bit by bit, video by video, but it's very hard to not be judgemental. You are covering so many points in your work and doing it in a truly brilliant way! The way you assign different roles to different characters makes it easier to talk about complex issues.  I also appreciate the strong Lynch vibe. The production, music, and delivery are off the map great! Thank you!  I've discovered your channel through watching you debate Blaire White. I found myself unable to agree with Blaire on her belief that transwomen are born biologically male. I've never felt like I've been all male prior to transition. It's not that simple. It can't be that simple. Maybe some are more male, and others aren't. I can't know. But given the biological diversity and how complex the biological sex is even outside of our own self-perception... I think there's much more to that than XY & XX.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Correction that you've probably gotten a lot, but I don't actually see it in the comments right now, so: 'otokonoko' literally just means 'a boy' in Japanese, though it is figuratively used more often to denote male crossdressers. Side note but oh, GOD, the point you briefly bring up about anime just brings a rush of bile into my mouth because it's definitely not just the Western anime fandom that's horrifically transphobic and transmisogynistic. The source material already depicts non-gender-conforming individuals in such derogatory ways and you'd THINK Japan would be more sensitive about this kind of thing considering that gender nonconformity is kind of a Thing there but nope. I understand there are cultural differences and all that but as an actual East Asian insider tbh I think 'cultural differences' is just a bullshit excuse for the close-mindedness that's prominently on display.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Adria reminds me of how I am treated when I voice a 'controversial' opinion when it is, in fact, a perfectly logical one.

"Blaire white doesn't wish to be a cis woman, this is a low blow and you are just jealous she can get 'str8' dick. What's the whole point of transitioning if not 'passing' I don't get this contradiction around acquiring some feminine traits and playing on some woman stereotypes to pacify your dysphoria, but then doing a 180deg turn with the whole 'a woman is what a woman is' bs, it honestly sounds like jealousy it's the same thing with sexual attractiveness and being 'not like other girls' because you feel you can't reach the standard you are so obviously trying to archive, but failed and feel the need to justify it by saying some cis women have manly traits. As for Traps being gay and the feminine penis part, back when I was still wondering about my sexuality and denying part of it I would have said 'no, traps aren't gay, because I like femininity' but then I had to come to terms with it,  the dick, feminine or not, is still there and whether you like it or not if you are sexually aroused by the person it is attached to regardless of it and sometimes even because of it, I hate to break it to you, but as a male you are somewhere on the kinsey scale other than 0, but you can still deny it and identify as you like, due to the social stigma is easier to avoid it and not think about it at all while still enjoying your shemale porn, which in a weird way is better than straight porn because the person doing the penetration isn't a dude so you won't have to see his manly butt on the shots when you could be looking at a womanly one.

"I would argue that it's more important to focus on whats true, rather than what kind of truth you can construct to create the outcome you want. You want there to be no violence against trans people, so you create a definition that gets around all the things about the transgender condition that has caused violence to be in sighted onto them in the past. Why is this approach better or more productive than simply educating people about the plight of transgenders, educating people about dysphoria and WHY and WHAT trans people feel? Don't you think its more important for people to understand what you're going through and understand why it's important for them to respect your choice to present as a woman, rather than creating loopholes so bigots can't say 'you tricked me' in defense  of actions all reasonable human beings already should know are completely indefensible? Like honestly, a feminine penis? You mean to suggest that because hormone therapy causes your dick to stop working, it's somehow a feminine penis now? The trans-person is not a woman, they are presenting as a woman, and we should treat them as woman, but when it comes down to questions like the one discussed in this video, you need to deal with technical details, and the technical detail and reality of it is, you aren't a woman. You deserve in all respects to be treated as one in any and all social situations (not including doctor visits of course) but you weren't born that way and you had to go through significant steps to present that way, and you know this. In your video about autogynephilia you seem to acknowledge that you are onto a woman, but that being feminine feels right and natural to you. I don't dispute that. That is what I think people should always say. Not that you are a woman, but that you feel right and natural displaying as one, and people should respect that not as a personal choice but as part of who you are. Why do you need to take it a step further, and say that trans woman are women, that a trans persons penis is just a feminine penis, that attraction to a trans woman is the equivalent of attraction to a cis one. It doesn't make transgenders less legitimate for people to say a man born a woman who lives there life as a woman is still in a technical sense biologically male. the problem shouldn't be, how to we change the meaning of transgender to remove stigmas so transgender people aren't attacked or hurt anymore, it should be how do we bring awareness to the fact that trans people are being treated unfairly and how do we educate people so they understand why we don't deserve to be treated unfairly, just as gay people don't deserve to be treated unfairly, because there is about the same amount of personal choice involved in the situation. You can either spend your entire life suppressing it or you can live with it.  I know I've rambled on for a long time but, look, there's reason I think its a good idea and that's because I was against trans people for a while. I lived in the bay area near san fransisco with a father who was homophobic and vigorously and unapologetically transphobic. I picked up some of his views when I was younger. Because I already had this bias for conservatism, when I saw all of these arguments for the left that I thought were totally unreasonable, I thought everything that my dad said about trans people was true, I was trans-phobic myself, because all the claims that were being thrown around sounded completely unreasonable to me, so I didn't lend any credence to the faact that transgenderism might be anything but prevision, or a grab for attention. It's only after dealing with forms of dysphoria myself while struggling with an eating disorder and hearing how similar (in certain ways not all ways) the feelings I felt regarding my body mirrored the ways that transpeople feel too. And I never would've come to that realization had I not broken the wall of absolute radical left ideas that get focused on in conservative circles and really looked at the source of transgenderism did I change my mind. Blaire is right. I don't like to point the accusatory finger, but when people like you make claims that aren't found in logical reason, you push others away from your cause. Straying from reality only widens the divide between the conservatives who are based in logic and reason (ie the skeptic community on youtube for instance), and that will only make it harder for you to deliver your message to those people.  Sorry for the long rant. I just don't have any friends to talk to in real life, and a lot of opinions.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I do agree that stigmas with dating trans woman should be stamped out.  However I think its fair to say not every straight person can so easily get down with the opposite genitals that they would normally be attracted to.  we are attracted to perceptions but those also extend towards the body, I applaude you for being able to get past the physical elements and see them as a whole and therefore become attracted to the opposite genital you would normally.  but some people cant do that and i really think thats ok.  some straight guys legitimately do not get sexually aroused by a penis even if it is attached to what his mind perceives is a womans.  ( and i dont mean they are a woman im just focusing on his psychological mind),  I disagree completely with the idea that straight guys only arnt into penises on woman because of 'toxic masculinity' or how they would be viewed by their peers.  although that can happen straight guys might just not like those genitals even on a female?  and thats ok just like if a straight girl was going to become sexually intimate with a trans man, there should be clear communication about what genitals are what sometime beforehand.  and if a straight girl cant mentally get past the barrier of the physical vagina that shouldnt be looked down upon or seen as transphobic. because that is controlling peoples sexuality and THAT is fucked up.  im sorry to all the trans people that dont get to bone because the mental habitions of their potential partner.  but if it is agreed some people really cant help but not be attracted to a specific genital the only solution would be forcing someone to have sex who does not want to. there can be a million reasons someone doesnt wanna have sex, transgender and genitals can just be one of them.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"my idea about presenting while trans all that.. of course you shouldnt HAVE to present yourself to a certain level as that gender to be trans, you are trans and how you present yourself is your own choice.  but i do think that there should be an understanding of confusion and that people on both sides of interactions should be mindful of that, If i accidently used the wrong pronoun while speaking to someone which could have been in large part by them not presenting as that gender loudly, id like to think theyd give me the courtesy to be understanding in my slip up, while i give them the courtesy to correct myself and use the pronoun they wish.  I dont hate trans people if i ACCIDENTLY use the pronoun they dont wish to be called.  to me its a matter of courtesy and i think all people should try and be more courtesy and understanding of each other.  Though i do really see it as a courtesy thing rather than a respect thing, with that i do understand people will on purpose use the wrong pronoun just to be an asshole and they could be an asshole to you because youre trans. and people generally have a aversion to things different then themselves.  But those people need to be seen as they are, assholes while going after people who mistakenly use the wrong one only makes them not to want to be courtesy and use the right one.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Contra, I have a question. When you said that not thinking trans men who date trans women are gay because it enforces their need to reaffirm themselves (toxic masculinity) if their friends find out they are dating a trans girl or whatever, it does sound like it's a strategy to adapt to bigotry and preserve trans women, which doesn't really fix the problem, but it's a manipulation of reality to suit the needs of the group in detriment of the facts. I don't mean to be a cunt, honestly. But do you get my point? You shouldn't adapt to bigotry and go out of your way to justify a person with breasts and a penis is the same as a cis woman just because you are afraid of violence from people who are not comfortable with their own sexuality and sexual preference. That's really absurd. I need to understand it. I'm legit confused about this whole debate because at the same time, as a cis woman, I wouldn't feel straight at all if I had sex with you, for example. But my main issue is I can't see trans women as equal to me (as women) even though I stated the latter. These conflicting ideas can't coexist and I need you to enlighten me.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I have often felt like I'm a walking target, just going about my business in my home town because I have a petite/highly vulnerable appearance.

"I really like your videos, but this might  be my favorite.  It seems that so many difficulties of political identity are deeply entwined with that engulfing emotional part of us, and yet this part is (in my experience) rarely given the compassionate, expansive exploration it deserves. This story does a wonderful job of connecting the scary confusion and despair that drives so many searches for a firm grounding in identity without ever trivializing those pathless journeys. You have an incredible storytelling voice, I can not wait to see what else you put your mind to.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Damn. No matter how sarcastic a tone you put on it, that ending hit hard. I know it'll take a while before these things sink in for those consuming too much far right or left media, but it's still such a relief to hear the middle ground of these arguments delivered so eloquently. I wish I could articulate my thoughts half as well as you.   And on a particular point, I have to agree with Adria... NOBODY TALKS ABOUT THE MOUTHFEEL!! This is my first time hearing anything about a feminine penis, and although it will still be a long time from now before I am brave enough to look into it, I am genuinely curious. I am cis scum who identifies as vaguely asexual because anatomy terrifies me. Everything about women is more attractive to me but, somehow, I know I am into men. I am not particularly knowledgeable about transexuality, and in passing I just assumed I wouldn't pursue a trans woman because I have a lot of emotional baggage and a self destructive need to care for other people - in honestly, my experiences with trans women in the past have been harmful... But maybe that's a niche I need to explore when crippling loneliness inevitably catches up with me as it does us all.   My apologies for this weird, selfish rant of a comment. I assume it won't be read and so I felt safe spilling some things. I watch a lot of video essays while doing other things, but this video reached me on confusing levels. Thanks.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm a new fan of ContraPoints and just rewatched this brilliant short film after watching Contras' debate with Blaire White, and I think I noticed a couple of references to that conversation. Firstly, the moderator here calls it 'a shitshow', which is exactly what Shoe0nHead says towards the end. Secondly, the pink anime wig Contra wears while talking to Blaire is sitting on set between Jackie and Adria. I know it's also used in other videos - and worn by the Doctor - but I just like to think these are knowing nods back to that stream. Of course, Tiffany seems like something of a pastiche of Blaire here as well, and her arguments at times specifically bring to mind Blaires' gatekeeping and transphobia towards Riley Dennis.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"imo for Blaire White, ShoeOnHead, and other anti-SJW YouTube gals, there's this obligation to be the 'Cool Girl.'   she's hot and fit and smart and, most importantly, she agrees with YOU, bro!! she's also a men's rights activist, isn't that cool?  also she doesn't care about dumb things like 'makeup' and 'fashion'...of course, she still looks beautiful without makeup!!  (as it turns out, this is just men not being able to tell whether a woman has makeup on her face; if she's 'beautiful without makeup,' he acts like that somehow makes her a better person.)  so i think there's also something to be said about these anti-SJW women YouTubers, who feel like they have to be 'not like other girls.'   and they feel like they have to devalue femininity, because makeup etc. is 'vapid' and 'shallow' (instead of a fun artistic hobby like any other hobby). but at the same time, they are still expected to LOOK feminine.  like, god forbid one of these anti-SJW women stopped shaving their armpits...their primarily male fanbase would go insane.

You don't have to be trans or even have to be able to empathize with the issues at hand to empathize with the humanity behind it. You projected that very clearly and effectively, and I can tell you're growing as a filmmaker. I just started watching you less than a week ago and I'm already super impressed at the growth from the first few videos till now. You're brave, you know the subjects you're talking about, you're willing to break out of the strict left/right binary war we're in the middle of, you're self deprecating without projecting self loathing (until the camera asks for it), you're creative with a wicked sense of style and absurdist morbidity, and you're frankly really fucking funny.

Men murdering women and trans men and ''traps'' in these types of incidents like rejection, isnt because of the patriarchy or because they were taught women are oblidged to sleep with men. It's because they're psychopaths who feel no remorse for their actions, and see everything they do as justified. The justification isnt necessarily misogyny its whatever their fucked up minds come up with.

"Not quite related, but it kinda reminded me of it. You know those people who self-identify as 'traps'. My guess is that the appeal of that is because it's a way to have your cake and eat it too. It's a way to openly present as female while also admitting that you're 'a man in a dress'. You get to change your identity without actually challenging your, or anyone else's worldview. 'Cross dresser' won't do, because that would mean 'actual man who dresses like, or pretends to be a woman'. 'Trap', however, has become a fetish term that means 'cute girl who's actually _kind of_ a boy, but not really' or 'pretty much a pretty girl, but with a penis'. So then not only do you not have to change your worldview and face the reality of your repressed gender dysphoria, you also have a small army of fetishists more than willing to validate your femininity by praising you for how cute and not male you look.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I love this video I wish I had found contrapoints sooner. Thank you Lindsay Ellis.

I do have one genuine question to anybody that may actually read this do trans women have a moral responsibility to tell hetersexual males that they are trans women? I'm trying to think of an equivalent some information that that a couple not in this situation would need to share with each other but I don't know that it exists it's not like a disease there's nothing wrong with that other person but at the same time it is something that a lot of heterosexual males would like to know so do they have a right to know?

"It's easy to understand that things are never black or white, it's the expansive grey area that is nuanced and complex. But when I hear mention of mutilation, as in cutting body parts off or shaving bones - a shiver runs down my spine. I watched a documentary sometime ago about women in Africa and Jamaica bleaching their skins because of some dominant ideology of 'beauty'. You don't see this as much in western countries, except perhaps in those that have become famous. There is also a dominant influence of what 'femininity' or what a woman should look like. Also 'masculinity' and what a man should like. I saw the video on 'incels' and I had never heard of that before. Both these videos were difficult to watch.

"Do you then think people like Ella Grant for example are just inauthentic, too, and 'in it for the boys' and are automatically 'not true to themselves'? Is it right to be this dismissive of their experiences, especially if you look at them in all their particularities, rather than 'let be'?  Do you not get the linguistic and definitonal drift in 'trap'? 'Trap' is about as close to its original first implied meaning in 'are traps gay' as it is in 'trap house' ('trap house' as in 'drig stash', as in Chapo Trap House). It carries none of the old implication. Also, I'd remind you that 'otokonoko' can have an implication of a freak or being demeaning anyway since it is just a smush-word of 'otoko' and 'onna', i.e. 'man' and 'woman'- its almost like 'ladyboy'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"To be honest, I do think it's important if trans people notify their partner that they are trans. Some people do want to produce offspring, some don't. Demonizing people who want to produce a kid with their lover is something I don't really see as progressive. Not wanting to date trans women on the basis of wanting to date for the sake of marrying someone by which you can procure children with is something I wouldn't constitute as homophobia. I do believe in trans right and understand it being a viable identity in both psychological/biological terms. However, a cis hetero ally isn't s bad ally if he/she doesn't want to date trans women/men. Some people more than others, do feel a strong urge to produce kids. I've always wanted my own kids as long as I can remember. That typically is only possible within the confines a male and a female having sex. Perhaps other cases exist too, idk. Either way. One is not a transphobe if they don't want to date trans people.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Honestly I really enjoy your content and think you certainly have some of the best political discourse on YouTube, and I liked this video overall, but I think its a little bit strawman-y to imply that people who possess a similar outward identity but different political beliefs than you are somehow self-loathing. I mean, if its something really egregious like the many situations where anti-gay religious leaders have turned out to be closet gays on the side, then I guess its reasonable to call that self-loathing or internalized oppression, but to imply that Blaire White types of transwomen who just happen to be more mega-centrist or right-leaning in their viewpoints have bad self-esteem issues or whatever just kinda rubs me as a cheap way to avoid addressing their opinions honestly. I mean you absolutely DO address their opinions honestly (which again, is why you are an absolute top-tier creator) but the whole implied smear on the mental health of those you disagree with maybe sort of muddies the waters of your actual good points, which are present in this video.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think it's so great you bring up the nuances of male and female penises and what that actually means. Let me open with that. We should talk about the mouthfeel more and everything! People genuinely do not know this. It's sad that bigotry and stigma do hold some back and hurt others. But while I like what you add to the conversation, you also remove other nuances from it.   That's why I feel I cannot be on anyone's side anymore. I can listen, yes, but I just have to disagree with everyone somewhere.  Example 1: Lesbians are a diverse group like any other, and even with zero transphobia, I am sure some cis and probably even a few trans lesbians will crave cis women for what cis women are and be attracted exclusively or predominantly to them or just to them and everyone that comes close enough. Because subtle differences exist here as well, to the other side so to speak - in some regards, in others none. But a lot of lesbians dont have any issue, and it comes to them naturally, and my guess is that it also depends on people's wider approach to gender and sexuality. Some of this is learned, some of this is hard-wired. Nature and nuture. Yet, very quickly cis lesbians with track records of being trans-friendly are thrown under the bus and labeled transphobes and TERFs (also transphobes) for what seems more an inability to express all these nuances I tried to lay out here correctly. Which is hard to do. For anyone. But fuck it, they're transphobes now and officially 'cancelled'. Let it be known in all the land. They then show a human response to the hostility?? Doubling down on all the transphobia, clearly (pls catch my sarcasm here).   Example 2: Your view of certain other trans women seems soul-crushingly unfair and even cruel from certain perspectives different than yours. I was seriously shocked at some bits. You dont mean to hurt, it's just the one-sidedness I guess. You really cannot speak for all trans women or trans people in general. No one can. Maybe you are referring to someone else, but people will think you mean women like Blaire White.  My impression is that you project patterns unto her like internalised bigotry with no possible way of proving it. It's a construct by you and your echo chamber. By doing that, you reduce and simplify her lived experience and intentions, and contribute to her demonisation, the on-going hate-train against her and her (trans and cis) supporters, while questioning her very agency and self-efficacy, and I think that's also harmful and diametrically opposed to your actual values. You do all the women that you do not and cannot represent as just one person or part of one ideological group a disservice.  Closing arguments: Not everything can be framed in 'politics' and 'power dynamics'. Like... as a fellow academic and a human being I so have to disagree with that approach in general, and vigorously so.  I wish I could support all trans people there are in the whole wide world, but that's actually impossible in your ideology. It makes me a persona non grata to stay away from.   Because of what *I think* are my nuanced compassionate views that I worked extremely hard on developing, by listening for endless hours to very different people, constantly questioning myself, I agree with everyone more or less and disagree with everyone more or less depending on what *complex multifactor issue* we are talking about today. To your side, unfortunately, this makes me an enemy who isn't trustworthy, who 'blindly believed bigoted lies', because you're blind - to the nuances I bring up that you have zero sensitivity for.  I have learned much from you, but your nuance only goes one way, especially here. Maybe these are just the limits of the human brain and this is why my head feels like it's gonna burst. Maybe it's because you are personally deeply affected yourself and this is what benefits you (in like a selfcare way, not an insidious way).  Maybe it's all connected to a general problem of the progressive left, where I actually had to free myself from many beliefs concerning my own life in order to become a stronger, more mentally healthy person. Let me correct myself: Not everything *should* be framed in 'politics' and 'power dynamics', especially not in such an absolute way, where it's the only approach, the only paradigm, the superior, single, valid ideology. The possible effects include projection, catastrophising and yes, self-victimisation.   Please listen better, try on different glasses, for real. Please try to work toward less hate and polarisation, for real.   Despite all my support for you and me seeing so much validity in your points of view over the years and still today, I recently lost a friend who means so much to me, who doesnt want to be my friend anymore, simply because I am able to also like Blaire as a person and see validity in her perspective - without attaching all that crap to her.  Seriously, I didnt realise the extent of misrepresentation and demonisation of Blaire that you also foster until I lost a close friend who has no idea who Blaire even is and what positive influence she also has. Why is Blaire not another trans women with legitimate concerns behind her statements, who adds to the picture, however much or little you want to allow her? And very importantly, who gives some trans people some much needed genuine confidence in themselves?   It's really the old Us vs. Them, isnt it? Intellectually underwhelming. Never right. I said nuance a lot here. I think it really is the key to understanding everything. But you let other people who also wrongfully project shit into her as well, just different shit, ruin her for you. We should all see each other more as one person, with one point of view, but then you really gotta stop the hate-train. (You realise what your movement does to her goes way beyond criticism right?)  I think politically no one has to be converted to any general perspective really. We can have all the plurality, including your streak of the rainbow, and all the freedom of speech within the laws against violence we currently have in many countries already. You just need people to practice healthy non-violent behaviours, in general, and work on their ability for putting themselves in other people's shoes, at least for a moment, so that they dont have to flip their shit over nothing that important. So that they can maybe soften their views a little, become less radical, less hostile. So that we can talk with each other.  But that's all I can spew for now. Sorry for the manifesto. Live long and prosper.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Many men are attracted to FEMININITY.  And in today's world... some trans women, femboys, cross dressers and drag queens often EXAGGERATE feminine qualities in a time where many cis-women are down playing their natural femininity for reasons of safety ... and Materialism.  I was shocked to discover that most bisexual men are attracted to masculine men!  I'm one of the guys who are attracted to women and Transwomen ... but I've also learned that:  1.) Men who will have sex with transsexual MtFs ... and the rest ... are NOT completely 'straight' on the ... Kinsey scale. Gradients. So what! We're living in a paradigm that is out of date and horribly misunderstood. But... I .. digress...  2.) And I have also learned that Trans women are not the 'same' as cis-women.'  Not just because they don't have a uterus nor XX chromosomes ... but because the vast majority don't relate to male lovers the same way cis-women do. That ... cannot be denied.   Again... SO WHAT???  I KEEP saying that while there is a range of gender ... most Trans people are making a big mistake by insisting they HAVE to be in one of binary box or the other. NO!   I see transwomen as their own unique gifts to the world.  (Call me wrong, but it looks like Leonardo da Vinci was at LEAST bisexual--- even though evidence appears that he saved his seed and never had sex with anyone --if that can be believed... and I think he WAS either a cross dresser ... or maybe even a person who would have been 'Trans' today.')  Again... Trans people were traditionally the Shamans, healers, 'magicians' .... and even advisors to rulers of antiquity.  Trans women in relationship .... and in art ... bring their own special gifts of healing and intimacy to the table.   I say Trans people should step OPENLY into who and what they are instead of slipping into the trap of being what they aren't.   NO.. the beautiful, highly sexy transwomen are NOT men.  Men do not shake like that nor act ... nor make love like that! (ouuuueeee!) But they don't relate over time like cis-women do either.

"As a trans woman myself...this hits fucking hard. I don't see content that talks about the consistent battle the trans community has to advance....the war within, and the war without, as the Lotus would say. This battle is something I have to deal with all the time, with older trans women like Cait Jenner and Blaire spreading shit everywhere, and I know it's probably something you do too CP...it's so awful, having to deal with them, trying to argue that progress won't come their way, through their means... fighting our own kin.  People like Contra and I end up having to try and show rather than tell, which is damn-near impossible for the type of information we're trying to convey...you can't just show someone that everything in their life which has led to their current survival and existence is wrong without a shit-ton of resistance, as evidenced by what the Tumbles character exemplifies in this video...it's ridiculous, and I just wish that we didn't have to, but it's the reality of what some of us have to do. I don't know what your actual opinion about this type of argumentation is Contra, but I am really happy you're showing people what we have to deal with whenever trans communities interact with one another.

"But traps near as I can tell have at no point had anything to do with trans people. Sometimes there is use of hormones to 'feminize' but within trap fiction the intent is never to biologically transition into a female. It's really more of a social transition, and even then not really into female.  And I guess I'm not really the best person to know first hand because I view my own gender and sexuality as very blurry things but shouldn't we not demonize people for having a innocently shocked reaction to have a homosexual relationship a a straight person with someone they thought was female just because we can try and tie to trans people and how society views them?

I don't mean surgery, but an actual transformation from male to female, phenotypically and physiologically.

"I like when you do videos like this much more than your 'explication' videos. In those videos where you just say what you think about the political issues you end up sounding quite preachy, not because you don't make legitimate and good points (you make quite good points), but instead because I don't feel that you give the opposing political perspective(s) their due (I know you make an effort, but I don't think you're that skilled with it).  The reason why I love these 'skit' videos quite a bit more is because--intentional or not--you actually portray a union of whats good about the major perspectives and whats bad about them.  I recall quite a while back that you suggested that you couldn't write 'high literature' or whatever term you used. I disagree. Though this isn't written, I think this is actually exactly what you were aiming for. I really believe that if you did set your mind to it, you could probably achieve that goal. Really, this is quite good stuff.  Though what you say about literature reinforcing social power dynamics and the like is true, its also true that there are a myriad of examples of literature doing the opposite and speaking truth to power. For example to consider Heart of Darkness a racist and sexist book is probably true; but its also a book that brought to light the horrors of the British Empire in Africa. I think you do something quite similar (albeit from the perspective of the politics in the left) with videos like these.  Don't take this as a recommendation not to make those explicative videos. I think those are important for you as well. I just wanted to emphasize how much these skit videos are fucking awesome.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Jokes aside, I went through this same problem of 'not like the others' syndrome. I was discovering my sexuality and found I was bisexual but leaned more towards men. I also liked the idea of being feminine and cute. Now before this, I had followed news about how weird American Gay Pride parades could get (for example, an adolescent in underwear twerking in front of a ring of adult men) and I ignorantly thought that I might become like that if I kept pursuing my sexual daydreams, as well as losing my masculinity. I tried everything from looking at more straight porn, to just not thinking about it. I even asked for help on reddit and I got responses from submissive bears to not worry about it and was told I had 'internal homophobia'. I thought about it for a bit and decided that I would submit (;) ) and just accept the feelings I have.  I felt a lot better afterwards. A whole lot better. And I didn't have to do it for anyone else but me. Good vid, Contra.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I love the way you humanize all your characters, and give all your characters flaws.  My favorite part is the part towards the end where Tiffany kinda tries to reach out to Adria, almost for sympathy, but Adria scares her off.  Even though the temptation is strong to see Tiffany as the bad one because she's obviously wrong about a lot of things, that interaction highlights the responsibility we leftists bear in driving vulnerable people away from us, and how hard it is, but how important it is, to meet people where they're at, and with compassion.    Somebody in the comments linked the debate you had last year with Blaire White (who I hadn't heard of before) and I watched the whole thing, and as a 3rd party it touched me because it really seemed to be a situation where you had two basically decent, sensitive people struggling to get into each others' vocabularies and still get their basic needs met, ending in a sort of tragic stalemate because each could only hear attacks in the words the other perceived as 'normal.'  I think your ability to empathize with and in a way _become_ the Tiffanies of the world is what makes you so uniquely good at elucidating concepts at the heart of leftist praxis.

"There's obviously so many brilliantly clever things about this video, but I think Jackie Jackson is getting underappreciated here. A 'centrist' who cares about finding the truth and supposedly thinks debate is valuable IMMEDIATELY cuts off an actual bit of interesting discourse at 6:51 because it isn't relevant to her (or at-least, she fails to perceive how it is relevant to her). Also this moment is one where Jackie, the one with the media platform being used here, undermines Adria's desire to unpack and discuss the use of trap as a slur. As soon as it becomes clear that the TV show would lose credibility for even letting 'trap' be a part of the moot, the words are changed. This can be seen as a bit of ground given to Adria, but I also think that it's a valuable critique of how online political media is worse than ever for reframing things to isolate them from their context. Beholden to smaller and less diverse audiences, creators are financially incentivised to double down even further on giving people what they want than even old-school broadcast news media. This point is reiterated when there's a hard cut from a tearful Jackie to a cool and collected Jackie shooting the outro and promising to fix it in post, followed by her calling her producer to discuss very cynically how the two guests 'performed'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"At the end of the day, people want a specific set of things out of their partner, so pretending to be the thing someone wants when you aren't truly, isn't fair to everyone else either. Genitals are important to the vast majority of people, and for many so is a uterus/balls if they want their own children. We should be simply working on acceptance of trans people instead of trying to force the idea that they are 100% the same as the sex they feel they're supposed to be, you are different, and that is FINE, we have to accept difference and embrace it, not hide it by applying something else's label. Use a trans term to describe yourself, and if people aren't into you, that's their preference, respect has to go both ways. Straight people are generally into feminine or masculine people of the opposite sex, that's a minor trait to the average person... The genetic sex of a person, what genitals they have plays an important role in attraction, a genetic role...","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"ContraPoints, I just want to say thank you. About 9 months ago (Fall 2017) I found your channel, and it really played a role in coming up from the rabbit hole. I had been a passive follower of what became the alt-right, passive in that I consumed the media, and got into the online arguments with people about all the political issues. After the election I was shocked. I had assumed that giving Trump the benefit of the doubt would be a harmless activity, that there was no way he'd actually win. I wasn't a full on supporter, mind you, but I had fallen more on the center right spectrum, inching very closely to a very ugly group. After he won I was in shock, it really was a slap to the face that America really hadn't evolved past things. I spent the next few months trying to reconcile everything. I had connected with some more progressive media channels, but it was your channel that really pulled me back into thinking. I just wanted to give this brief summary so you know that what you are doing works. I used to watch the two channels you were referencing and many worse. Seeing you present them in your style really made me reflect on my thoughts and the role your style of content played in coming back from a strange place. So, Thank You.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"OK, straight white man here, so keep the torches & pitchforks on standby, but I suspect that a lot of my fellow CIS-whatever-the-fucks find this to be a headscratcher: Straight men are attracted to good-looking trans-women, truth be told even if they know they still have their cock & balls. Problem is, being straight men we strongly tend to want pussy. On an emotional level this is arguably pretty shallow, but on a biological imperative level, tough shit, I want labia. Personally, indistinguishable fully functional surgical facsimiles of lady bits will suffice. I mean such good work that if you weren't told you'd never guess in a million years. Is this possible yet? Meanwhile, why would a gay guy want to date someone who looks and acts like a woman? How are they going to strike up a romantic relationship in the first place? 'Ah, I was looking for a hot guy but this gracile effeminate earth mother with a fat rack will do nicely'. Huh? Sure, when they get down to it all the kit is in the right place, but will that carry the day if they look and act like a chick? I don't find masculine women attractive. I'm not keen on banging a female bodybuilder, even if she does have a muff and a great personality. Well, maybe . . . In other words, surely the cuffs and collars have to match. If you're a straight guy who sleeps with a trans woman, then actually you're gay. If you're a gay guy who sleeps with a trans woman, then . . . well you're bisexual surely, or else what's with the femininity fetish? If you're a trans woman with a dick who's a lesbian . . . you're a straight guy.  The alternative is to just ditch the labels as after a certain point they become pretty inadequate. Which is fair enough. Yet labels serve a function, they aren't necessarily pejorative, they're indicative. The issue that concerns me is, how do people politely avoid their own private version of The Crying Game without giving offence or being politically nuked?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

This suggest that all the new genders are actually sub-genders and not specific genders, therefore the idea that there are 'only two genders' is still valid.  The only problem is otherkin, which are not actually genders but enjoy the transcendental identity aspects of the new genders. I say 'enjoy', otherkin are actually more maginalized than Transracial people like Rachel Dolezal or whatever name she is going by now.

"6:11 - 6:50 I feel like there's some truth in this statement but most of it is a strawman. I very much agree with Tiffany in the first part. The way to acceptance is not to scream at everyone for not being woke enough. It's not to make people have to walk on eggshells around you. How would you feel if you had to worry about getting screamed at, or at risk of losing family, friends, your job, or your livelihood because you said something that you didn't even know was incorrect or offensive?  That being said, I don't think the way to acceptance is letting bigotry just slide by, you have to actively fight against real maliciousness, but not people making dumb jokes to be edgy.  Also let me just say, people really do say stuff like 'You're a good tran/gay' or whatever and it's because a lot of people see the lgbt community as a joke. We're seen as a bunch of whiny babies who complain about everything under the sun. Of course we're not obliged to make ourselves seem completely sane, but if we want people to take us seriously, we have to make an effort to at least show we're not whiney babies. And this is not by forcing trans women or men to pass more, or forcing trans people to only be straight- it's all about acting like sane rational adults and also not calling anyone ____phobic for disagreeing (e.g. calling a dick a male organ) or by not meeting your impossible standards of 'wokeness'  I'm sure most people would agree that Tiffany (btw I know she's just a character) has her heart in the right place, but is approaching things wrong. Not calling out bigotry and calling yourself a trap is not the way to fight for acceptance.  Oh, and to answer the question are traps gay... well yes they are because they're not transwomen But to answer the question 'is dating a transwoman gay (if you're a man, of course)' The answer is no. Not because the dick is feminine (I don't really know what a lady dick looks like so how would I know tbh...), but because they're attracted to the feminine qualities of the transwoman, as you said contra.

"I think it's a generalisation to say that all right-wing trans youtubers are just pandering and struggling with internalized transphobia. There are really trans people out there with right-wing conservative views that are separate from their trans identity. And the 'I'm not a victim' mentality isn't necessarily a bad mentality. It promotes that in stead of crying about your shitty situation, you have to learn to deal with it and thrive regardless of your societal disadvantages. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't acknowledge those societal disadvantages and fight to diminish them.  You also shouldn't reach out to bigots and try to compromise with them, like 'alright, transgenderism is a mental illness, but I'm self-aware about it' or 'yeah, dating a trans chick as a man totally makes that man gay' or 'sure, non-binary / translesbian / bdsm trans people are freaky and crazy, but a hot, cis, straight trans woman is okay right?' As a result of those kind of comments, you see a lot of people on YouTube who might defend people like Blaire White to death because 'she is a conservative who speaks out against pc bullshit', but will still bully and harass every other trans person for being trans. So yeah, just wanted to add that. You make really good points in this video, but I also still think right-wing conservative trans people are valid.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

There is no such thing as one way to be a 'woman.' So curling one's hair doesn't make one a 'woman.' Wearing makeup doesn't make one a 'woman.' I'm concerned that  using these performative socially situated norms to describe what makes one person a woman are very narrow and play into preexisting gender biases.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The exchange around 11:30 was hard to watch because I've had thoughts like that about trans women before - not proud of it - and I still don't think it's a simple black/white issue. I get the same feelings of betrayal from cis women who perform gender in a really elevated, high-cost, high-effort way - shaving, makeup, constant high heels, plastic surgery, etc. I resent the people who tie femininity to products and services that just makes Sephora's CEO rich and effectively become a tax on womanhood. Men don't have to spend an extra 20 minutes in the shower every other day shaving their legs. Men don't have to spend an average of 15,000 dollars per lifetime just so they can be considered 'professional' or 'trying hard enough'. I envy men a lot for the ease at which they can move and be in the world. But I have no idea what trans women go through and ultimately they gotta do what they gotta do to survive and find peace of mind. I dunno, it's complicated.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"So I think the moral here, is that actually, Tiffany needs to be taking MORE responsibility for her life, identity, and choices.  She seems to say over and over again how she's 'not a victim', but yet is unconsciously playing under some list of 'rules' and 'criteria' that she believes are aspects of 'natural' women, as she ends up offending the talk-show host some point throughout this video with her comment on noses, therefore insinuating that she actually is not some sort of self-identified maverick and is actually harboring an assumed notion of how the world works.   Essentially, I gather the message here is to further take responsibility for everything you think, and not assume it's just a game that everybody else should (or even is, in Tiffany's case) playing by.  Does this make sense? I think I hit the face of what 'internalized oppression' is right on the nose, but I'm not sure.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Why is that so difficult for people to wrap their junk around? Anyway, you've officially made it onto my short list of trans girls I have crushes on. I don't expect that to mean anything special to you but it is special to me since I tend to be straighter than most other guys (in that most straight guys have pretty bad transdar[?] which, personally, can be quite funny to me at times). Blair is on that list of course, but she managed to say something so ugly a while back that it actually affected my physical attraction to her. Sigh... My number one is an IRL girl that either doesn't know I'm interested or just isn't interested in me. I still don't know if I could make the jump but I'm pretty sure if one of you colloquial guys jumped me I'd let it happen and I don't think it would be gay of me at all. Anyway, so glad I found you.

"Some of the talk show portion feels disingenuous.  Memes aside, I have no idea if 'the feminine penis' is so drastically different in sex than 'normal', but can we not admit that terms like 'lesbian' are ill-equipped to describe the spectrum of sexual identities and preferences that exist now?  Are you not contributing to the problem yourself by embracing this inherently limiting language?  Surely we can admit that not all women that are attracted to other women are going to be into a penis once the clothes come off, regardless of how 'feminine' it is, right?  I can only speak with confidence about my own sexuality, but genitalia does matter to me in bed.  It seems like you even sort of indirectly acknowledge this through the Adriana character.  Her defense against the host (regarding being attracted to men) is that she only likes 'feminine penis'.  Surely this is a much finer distinction than preference between penis and vagina, and the language you're choosing to use completely ignores these distinctions.  I'm not trans, so my stake in this whole thing is quite low, but the treatment of trans people is very much spotlit, so it's hard to ignore.  From the outside, it really just seems like it's often the wrong things that are being focused on.  'Wrong' in this context meaning things which are either not productive or are actively counter-productive to perceived causes.  I understand you've changed your views a lot over time anyways and that you don't claim to have all the answers, but it's undeniable that you have a large online presence on this front, so I feel like pressing you to be self-critical, especially given that these videos are made to be more easily consumed while also being distinctly un-academic, is important.

"dear contrapoints, erasure of native culture and replacing it with colonial european culture is one literal definition of genocide, a form of racism. forcing the children of my entire nation into catholic schools to be raped, killed, and converted, being beaten or killed for even speaking our own language, is racism, and is the means to enforcing european gender culture and sexual culture on native people. killing us off so that your people can illegally (according to US federal law, international law, and the laws of my people) occupy our lands and propagate anti-indigenous and anti-transgender culture is racism. how can you see erasure of native culture with the intent to replace it with white culture, as anything other than genocide and racism? why do you make jokes about this aspect of genocide when it leads to the deaths of transgender native women, more than any other demographic in recorded history? trans women and yonkwe people have been our leaders since before human memory, up until the ongoing european invasion of our lands began. how can you not see this simultaneous dismantling of our governments and gender cultures as anything but racism? when you see the effects of a complete material genocide of native people, and inhabit areas where there are none of us left, does that justify western binary colonial culture eradicating mine? how does that work for you?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Ain't nuffin gay about the feminine benis :DDDD","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"When Jackie starts comparing herself to Tiffany this shows her concern as making the discussion about her insecurities. However there are harmful feminine norms that cis women have to put up with. I think that this is something that seems to mainly be talked about by TERFs, while self declared intersectional feminists just call it choice and therefore fine. The Tiffany Tumbles of this world do perpetuate this norms, not by trying to pass but by policing those that don't, whether they are trans or cis.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Something bugs me about this video.  Do you intend for me to feel compassion toward Tiffany?  Her whole persona is a severe lack of compassion, and she makes the world a worse place doing it.  She ought to be satisfied that we merely refrain from the type of deliberate cruelty she would dish out herself.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"This video is absolutely amazing. It comes from a position of compassion, and we need more of it. And on that note, I'm a bit surprised that not many (or any?) of the comments seem to address the fact that a part of the reason Tiffany's journey took a bad turn is the response to a ill-informed comments she got from supposed allies. Here's one harsh truth I've had to face in my own activism: Being right has no value if you're not persuasive. And what I mean is, there are many ways of saying the same thing, and oftentimes the goal is more important than what's actually being said or done. So I wish that we, as a community of well-meaning people, would give some thought to how we communicate things. It's hard being nice to people who say hurtful things, but if there's a chance that it creates a relationship where change is possible, then perhaps it's worth at least considering? I mean, you can always call them fucking nazi scum later.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Great video as always, but if I may offer some constructive criticism, I think your acting technique could use some work; I can tell that you're either forcing or holding back, both of which make for an unconvincing performance. The thing about acting is that you can use your experiences and imagination as a guide, but ultimately the emotion has to come naturally, and in order for that to happen you need to be willing/able to surrender your self consciousness and just be in the moment.

I'm male and I'm relatively satisfied with being one, so I can't imagine what it is like to not feel comfortable as your assigned gender, but I imagine it's not pleasant in the slightest. Up until recently I've had no exposure to anyone transgender IRL, but Then I met a transgender male who is very early on in his transition. While it was difficult at first due to me not being used to it, I'm now able to fully visualize him as a male and use correct pronouns, and I noticed just how much of a difference that made and we have now become close friends. Your videos have really helped in this process by giving great insight and information for an outsider such as myself, so thank you.   Also side note: you look absolutely stunning in the video!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Another superb one, congrats! The acting in this is solid too!   Jackie's concern about who's what kind of gay with what sort of penis seems like quite a reductionist way to talk about attraction? Like, it surely wouldn't be controversial to say that a beauty mark or a certain hair colour on one person isn't as attractive to an individual viewer as on someone else, so why not a penis? Like just because someone has a crush on one blonde person doesn't mean they're automatically 5% more attracted to all other blonde people or whatever, because people aren't attracted to abstracted features but to a whole person - their personality, their vibe, their body, accent, the sweet things she says on Twitter, the fact that she's really clever, the YouTube content she makes...

"Well this sure was a video to watch while I was already sad, dysphoric, and drunk.  But still, it was a fabulous piece of work. Tiffany was obviously the show-stealer, but I liked how Adria managed to ultimately stand as an independent woman against the roles pushed on her by both external heterocisnormativity and internal biases w/i trans/queer communities. But there was also some (minor, praxis-oriented) criticisms of her as well; maybe we as a culture should be talking about girl-dick, but a debate with Tiffany overseen by Jackie was neither the time nor the place. But she was also willing to defend Tiffany the _moment_ that Jackie started attacking her.  And I loved the quieter moment where they talked to each other 'off-camera'. I really wish we had gotten more of that exchange; it turned the tide to focus sympathy on Tiffany, yes, but these are two characters with a *lot* to say to one another. I hope we get to see them interact again.  A lovely piece of work, Natalie. Probably your best yet.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Seems that when internet personalities base their identities around fans/subscribers/other users, the dysphoria comes not from cis or straight people, but from people with similar comparable identities. So when they feel attacked, they lash out at their own community, and thus gain favor with people who would normally shun them. Turns out having a thousand people who accept you at the push of a button solves depression pretty quick, but other gays/trans people/etc that can be compared to you? What a bunch of cunts. It happened with Milo Yiannopolous, it happened with Blair White, and it'll keep happening until somebody like Natalie recognizes it. Thank you.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"The first time I watched this, I thought, 'Jeez, this is abstract.  I think I'm missing the boat here.  Why can't she just do more stuff about capitalism?'  But on the second watch (and reading some of the comments) I realized that while I couldn't really viscerally relate to what I was seeing, that a lot of other people could.  That realization led me to contemplate what it really means to be a trans person and I think this video even gives us breeders a glimpse of what dysphoria really means.  It's a very rare window into the soul of another human being (though I like to think and frankly hope that the author is very different from the character Tiffany) and I really appreciate it.  I hope that the experience of this video will help me to become a better ally to the LGBTQ community.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The hypothetical debate was a great mixture between interesting and intelligent points, while ensuring that opinions you disagree with aren't strawmen. Plus it had a great bit of Rubin bashing, which I love.  To ruin this comment, I thought I'd add that at 1:53, I said out loud to the video 'Are traps gay?' thinking it might be that, and it was.

"Thank you for posting this Contra!  I use to be a big fan of Anti-SJW slogan of thinking any unrepresented minority group voicing their grievances was a 'victim complex,' cry baby.  Also I use to think of the whole 'facts over feelings,' as a perfect way to defeat what I believed as silly emotional arguments; when in reality there's cases when the person is just asking to be treated humanely in society.  I started to become not able to tell the difference of a poorly presented argument for trans people vs. good arguments.     You made me rethink things better about issues regarding trans people, non-binary, and even feminist related topics.  Just because some very vocal progress have very poorly represented ideas for better treatment of trans people/non-binary dose not mean we should then just go in the other extreme direction and silence trans people/non-binary.  Also that whole 'are traps gay,' thanks for giving a more mature take on it.  And thanks for making those jabs a Dave Rubbin and Blaire White.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

My first boyfriend constantly brought up how embarrassed, and unsatisfied he felt for having a transgender girlfriend.  He would dead name, and misgender me in the guise of 'joking'.

This isn't something that I can possibly talk about with other people and this limitation is entirely of my own fashion.     I try to play video games and by admitting as much I am immediately suspicious of myself. This is my first comment on youtube.  Hbomber seems to illustrate the displacement from play in his latest video. We seem to frame ourselves outside of ourselves under current conditions.  I feel like Contra and Hbomb extend themselves beyond the content they produce. I like this a lot.   I am older than both these dangerous creatives (I think) by a few years at least,   I'm not sure why that matters.   A commodity produced under late capitalism is typically separate and alien,  possessing no mouth-feel that can be expressed  without exchange value.  I may just be a pretty face sometimes (and also a big fat yorkshire bloke)! I'm quite anxious about this. When I try to communicate  I don't seem to get to far beyond my own consumption of things.  I'm not sure why, but I want the discussion (of course this is part of the same drive) Perhaps talking with Tiffany is beyond my ability.  But I like you both.

"So I think this was a really great video.  I think like this sort of shows the different issues with the two different brands of transgender outreach on social media.  I think it's true that the Adria's of the world will not be taken seriously in and of themselves, but trying to go the opposite route a la Tiffany is just denying yourself and creating a scenario where you basically are just self-loathing because the logical conclusion of your views is that who you are as a person is not okay.  Adria is closer to the right message, but I think on the PR side you have to choose a mixture of these messages.  Moving away from the PR to the personal, yeah, it's really sad that people go through life like this.  But there's millions of Tiffany's all over the world, and not just trans Tiffany's, but all kinds of Tiffany's.  Person of color Tiffany's, gay Tiffany's, lesbian Tiffany's, intersex Tiffany's, atheist Tiffany's, feminist Tiffany's, disabled Tiffany's, etc.  I'm not trans, but in another domain of life, I sort of feel like I've chosen become a Tumbles by default.  More specifically, I don't have to broadcast that I'm different than other people, so I just keep on pretending.  Sometimes I don't even feel like I'm very different than other people.  But I am, and I still don't really know how to fully process that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've dated cis women who had a lot of body hair.  Their body hair did not make them 'male'.  I've dated cis women who had almost no chest fat.  Their lack of breasts did not make them 'male'.  I've dated cis women who had large, strong noses.  Their noses did not make them 'male'.  I've dated cis women who had broad shoulders and narrow hips.  Their torso physiology did not make them 'male'.  Certainly, all these markers inform a general sense of what society considers 'feminine', but I don't see how they do anything to determine who is 'female' or not.  Certainly, self-identifying as a cis-het male, my romantic interest is directed toward my own personal concept of the feminine -- but I think it's absurd for anyone to take *their* concept of what is 'feminine', & try to extrapolate that onto whether or not *someone else* is 'female' -- the question should never be 'is this person [male/female] enough for me to date?', the question should be 'does this person conform enough to *my* view of [masculine/feminine] for me to date?'

"Literally pinned the Lesbian Aesthetic before the character even said anything I'm like 'i like her style here a lot' yeah that's why lol. But yeah trans women are also (obviously) held to heteronormative standards, 'oh, you're a woman, you must like men then.' When my friend, who has only been attracted to women her whole life, came out as a woman everyone kept asking me 'oh, so she likes men?' No, her sexuality is still the same. (Not to say that people's sexualities can't change, especially on hormones, and that's valid, but cis heteros are usually looking through a narrow lens and not thinking about sexuality as a fluid thing but more as a heterosexuality to be their idea of what makes a woman a Woman (and a man a Man).  Anyway, I always respond 'no, she's still a lesbian.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Fuck me contra, I'm only recently coming to terms that I might be genderfluid (Iunno, it's weird. I don't fully understand it. But it feels like it fits for me), but was talking to a couple of my transgender friends about it literally today, and how I am somewhat jealous of them about how they can pass, while I'm 6'3, strong chiseled jawline and broad shoulders. One said how with enough makeup it could work, but I did say I can't do the amount of effort needed in order to pull it off. I for the most part am perfectly happy being called male in most scenarios, and can deal with it the rest of the time. I don't need to be considered female by anyone else but basically me when I feel it (I think. As I say, it's weird and relatively new to me).  Then I saw the make up at the end. And while you did look absolutely beautiful as tiffany, the level of work needed was heartbreaking to watch. I know I just don't have the patience or skill to be able to do that, and it just boosts my respect and admiration for you. I know the main theme of the video was internalized transphobia and self loathing, but god damn sometimes I wish I could look like you do, or at least have the patience for it.   I dunno, somewhat of an incoherent slightly drunk rant. Hope it doesn't bother you, was meant to be entirely complementary, with a hint of unneeded jealousy.

"I'm nonbinary, and I'm so Done with how some LGBT seem to treat my gender like it isn't trans enough. Though I'm pretty sure it's coming from a TERF in some way, it really bothers me how people seem to think I'm 'faking' because they THINK I don't experience dysphoria- or that it's not enough. It's rooted in the cisnormative idea that trans people are mentally ill by default, so if you don't meet a weird quota of self loathing you're not allowed. The white stripe in the trans pride flag is supposed to represent nonbinary people, for fuck's sake. And I don't get why it's so bad that I'm (mostly) okay with my body- isn't that what we all want? Isn't that the end goal? It's certainly not a loud bunch that says that, but when I see that argument of not being 'enough', it just bothers me.

"To be perfectly honest, I'm confused. Then again, I never had to think about what it means to be transgender. Might as well comment on 'trap': Of course it's a western term used to describe anime crossdressers. Then again, given how 'progressive' Japan is especially in media, the idea for it is to be a trap. And it's strictly applied to crossdressers; there's no such thing as transgender or if such a thing is referenced then it's by mistake.  Also, crossdressing is a whole bit in Japanese comedy. It's normal to laugh at a man who dresses like a woman. As for gays, moving outside the realms of yaoi and shonen-ai most of those are OTT stereotypes especially in shonen anime. Yet somehow, I can find an appreciation for them. Take for example General Blue in Dragon Ball. Originally, OTT and even likes young boys. Despite that, he's the first worthwhile antagonist for Goku in Red Ribbon Army arc and only 2nd best because Taopaipai exists (speaking of which, he also gets one of the best deaths I've seen in anime).  Anyway, the point of the above is I find it a bit hard to believe that anyone thinks Japanese media can be used as a proper progressive argument. Any time it does is by accident, and like Blue will be flanderised even if written somewhat ok as a character.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You're absolutely right, why isn't anyone talking about the feminine penis? Or the masculine vagina, for that matter. I had legit no idea hormones affected genitals to that kind of distinction, and it's been a huge terrible blindspot for so many years of being a terrible little fake activist. Now that you actually described it I think I can finally understand it so I can actually support my friends with the proper rhetoric to back them up. You do great work Natalie.  For whatever my horrible, quite possible incorrect opinion on people's attraction, from what this tells me I think someone, say a cis lesbian or straight man, not being attracted or comfortable with a trans partner's genitalia should in a perfect world fall under a similar category to being unattracted to a person's hairstyle. it shouldn't be a big deal for either partner, for some people it wouldn't even be a deal breaker, and even if this one person isn't completely mutually synced in a romantic standpoint there will be plenty more who won't mind and be perfectly attracted themselves. But in no circumstances should genitalia be treated as 'proof' that they aren't who they say they are. This girl has a penis and it's the penis of the girl, and claiming that it actually makes this woman a man is transphobic and rude and dangerous as fuck. Same goes for other genders.  That's my understanding of that specific issue. Feel free to correct me I know I'm not in any way qualified about this.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm not sure if I'd be so hard on the word 'Trap'. Sure, if one were to interpret it literally, it's pretty bad, but you have to consider the context. It became a popular term not just because of anime fans, but hentai fans particularly who would look at a pretty cartoon lady and then BOOM PENIS. Like 'are traps gay?' no one is asking the question literally or seriously and no one thinks deeply about the word 'trap' when saying it or typing it. It (along with 'shemale') also slowly became a term that became its own definition of something in that context, almost like a fictional race of third-gendered beings that we wish existed but don't. Violence against transfolk has been a thing decades before the tongue-in-cheek word floated around hentai porn communities and I don't believe the word itself is a malicious slur, even if I avoid using it myself. Trying to break down and philosophically dissect relatively harmless colloquialisms and taking them way more seriously than the users ever did is exactly the kind of killjoy Ivory Tower ramblings that you criticize in 'The Left'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I originally posted this as a reply, but I think it's an important point that people should consider: regarding 'transphobia is racist,' European colonialism OFTEN involved painting the genders/gender systems of colonized peoples as deviant, dangerous, and inferior, so forcing colonized peoples to conform to Western gender roles, just like the spread of Christianity, had a significant role in manufacturing 1. a justification for colonization and 2. suppressing dissent--in both colonizing and colonized peoples! Restricting and simplifying European gender norms in a way that posited *our* genders as superior made it easier to create an 'us vs them' divide, and stripping colonized peoples of their gender/ed traditions was pretty obviously demoralizing, dehumanizing, and was another way to turn the people who could conform to the colonial regime against those who couldn't. Not to say that there weren't damaging, restrictive gender systems that existed before European colonialism ofc, but the hegemonic (mainstream/powerful) gender system of '2 sexes, 2 genders that always link up with each other' is a relatively recent and very Western invention.  I don't know if it was Natalie's intent to invoke that history, but regardless it's an incredibly clever line, because just like 'the feminine penis' what Adria is saying sounds ridiculous and absurd without context, but with a little education you realize she's totally right. It also suits her character, imo, as someone who's a little self-serious but ahead of the curve politically. Excellent writing all around, love it!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"That was a roller coaster. I probably should have taken that trigger warning a little more seriously.  For most of the 'Freedom Report' segment, I found my current self identifying more with Adria, though my younger self probably would have identified more closely with Tiffany. The 'feminine penis' and 'mouth feel' comments cracked me up.  Then Tiffany reads the comments and has a breakdown...I know it's an act (at least in this instance), but there is truth in those words. Her internalized transmisogyny - or transphobia or bigotry or whatever you want to call it - really hit home for me. I couldn't tell you how many times I've had breakdowns like that and sobbed some of those same phrases, wishing I could be a 'real woman' or just someone else, someone 'normal.'  Suppressing those thoughts is...difficult, to say the least, and they often come bubbling back to the surface whenever I'm not sufficiently distracted.  Speaking of which - back to my regularly scheduled distractions...","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I also really love the exchange at 11:22 when Tiffany feels gorgeous, and bases her confidence in her looks to put down Adria and her right to existence when she wants to silence her in order to make trans women (and herself, primarily), more palatable to cisgender people. But this is immediately met by opposition by Jackie, who feels threatened by Tiffany's confidence and beauty. By calling her a hairless sextoy, Jackie invokes a (bad) feminist argument that trans women are inauthentic in their presentation of women because they enforce harmful notions of femininity. It's just a really interesting take on how women feel threatened by each other and how we tear each other down. Jackie and Tiffany would probably be at each other's throats all day, with Tiffany acting meekly to Jackie, but tearing down Adria as much as possible to win Jackie's approval. It's just such an interesting moment in this whole video!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Who does it affect when lesbian females only see other lesbian females as legitimate lesbians? Female homosexuality is a well documented and *protected* class of people under (Western) law. It's more than a feeling and beyond the choosing of an 'identity'. Lesbianism has been subjected to societies bigoted beliefs around female sexuality stemming from mysoginy and the desire to control female *bodies*. It is VERY much about the female sex. When some trans women  appropriate what it means to be a female homosexual, that doesn't help womanhood as a whole...it just seeks to diminish that which is already clearly defined. There is room for the creation of more terms that can better fit the reality of a trans woman loving and dating other trans women.

"The internalized bigotry, 'im not a victim' issue is one I had this week with so called friend of mine. I'm only in high school, but I'm pretty openly pansexual, and for some reason, my 'friend', (who is also gay) was offended by how often I talk about it. She wrote a long ass Instagram post about how people (like me) need to stop complaining about homophobia at our school, and how she's never been treated differently for her sexuality. Now, I'm happy that she's never had to experience homophobia, but that doesn't mean I and others haven't, and it certainly doesn't give her the right to be rude to me.

"I will never understand why people care so much how someone identifies and feels better within their-self or why they wish to make people who just sand out a bit more for whatever reason feel bad about themselves by stating 'facts' and 'calling them out'. Only reason that comes in mind is their own self hate and low self esteem that they try to pretend that it doesn't exist by making others feel bad, or try to do so anyways. I just hope that trans people, along with anyone else that stands out for any reason, will manage to feel comfortable in their own skin -literally- and be able to soon be accepted for their true selves. Remember people: As long as you are true to yourselves and try to become your greatest version, many people will love you and will wish to be with you, so don't give up and let haters have steam come out of their ears as they see your true happiness and glamour.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hey. So I was wondering if the comments could educate me more on the 'are traps gay?' Debate presented in the video. They seem to argue if it's gay for a man to be attracted to a trans woman or not. When I feel the discussion should more be if gay and straight are even the right words. Like I'm a straight cis man, but I find Contra to be attractive. I don't think it's gay or straight, (and the idea of a penis being involved at all feels like it would be a turn off, but I dunno, never been in that situation.) It just seems to show more that sexuality is a spectrum and that everyone has a different point in how a person looks that they'll no longer find sexually attractive. So still trying to use rigid definitions one way or the feels problematic. When instead we could just argue to accept what turns you on and what doesn't. I'm probably really wrong, and misinformed, or maybe even missed something obvious, but if anyone could explain or point me in the right direction that would be dope.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I love the detailed references to pop culture.   Red Pill: There's the obvious meaning of she's right wing so she's a red. But then there's also the matrix reference, in which the red pill is the pill that lets you stay in the delusion of the matrix. So by saying shes taken the red pill,  it implies that by shifting right she's embraced a delusion.  Sunken place:  In 'Get Out' black people who're bodies are possessed by white people are forced into the sunken place.  A thinly veiled allegory for how some white people tend to be more comfortable around black people who have forgone their 'blackness' and act 'white' So by saying Tiffanys in the sunken place, it implies she's forgone her transness in order to act more cis and therefore  be more accepted.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I see that the 'being hairless' issue  that came up in one of your live streams with Lindsay Ellis raised its head again. Glad to see your opinion on that issue, because that stream became very awkward quickly, but I hope things were resolved off camera. Other than that, this is a very informative, entertaining, and sympathtic video, but unfortunately, leans very heavily to one side. The feminine penis, which I thought was ludicrous at first, kind of makes sense to me now. I just never thought of it that way. But does that mean that there is a masculine  vagina? And would it still  be considered transphobic if a gay man as myself, is still not attracted to either kind of vagina? It  just does not appeal to me one bit, but I can and have been attracted to trans men. I don't know. Too much to think about and process,  but I know I will still be label transphobic. Either way, great work. Love your videos and this one especially speaks to me, as a person that has body issues. They are not gender reletated issues, but I can relate. I am sorry for your struggles, and I will do better to do my part at not contributing to the hostile environment trans people have to live in every day.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"When I see Tiffany portrayed, I see her as deeply dysphoric and truly terrified of society's reaction, which explains her adoption of a reactionary political stance while desperately trying to fit into the realm of social acceptability, while fearing that she'll never be accepted by even those with whom she agrees politically. The predominate emotion dominating her entire being is terror. Understandable, given the society we live in and the dangers it presents to transpeople.  Adriana, on the other hand, is equally aware of society's reaction to transgender people, but reacts in an entirely different way, with complete and utter defiance. As Tiffany responds with fear (I would say mortal terror masked beneath a superficial veneer of ultra-femininity, but I digress...), Adriana responds with a militant 'I am who I am, and if you don't like, you can fuck off!' mentality. In essence, Adriana has no more fucks to give. She would rather change society by being loud and proud, while refusing to allow society to dictate who and what she is. She would rather take the control over her life, which Tiffany secretly admires and respects, but loathes herself for lacking.   Ultimately, I deeply understand the frustration Adriana exhibits regarding Tiffany's attacking her, when they should stand in solidarity with one another to form a united front which says 'Fuck all!' to the world. She would rather look beyond the ascetics of one's appearance as a means of approaching transphobia and attack the issue head-on, but is frustrated by attacks from who she perceives as an obvious ally. There is a warrior mentality about Adriana that I deeply respect. She's a fighter and she's damn proud of it (as well she should be, in my mind!).  Am I wrong in perceiving a sexual tension between Tiffany and Adriana? Throughout the video, I wondered if the two set aside their different reactions to transphobia and support one another, that they would both likely end up the stronger for it. Tiffany can temper the fires within Adriana, her knack for confrontation and convince her to instead adopt a more diplomatic approach. While Adriana can recognize the deep insecurities that plague Tiffany and unravel them by reinforcing the reality that Tiffany is beautiful, that she is worthy of love and can truly be her gorgeous self no matter what anyone says; that ultra-fem or not, Tiffany has a valid place in this world. Ultimately, what I see Tiffany needing is someone who'll not only tell her all these things, but make her feel loved in a way that perhaps she has never felt before.  I love what you did with this video, ContraPoints, though to be honest, I always have this knee-jerk 'Oh, shit... hold on to your knickers. Battle Stations!!!' reaction whenever your reactionary characters pop up, as a guard against the blind rage real-life reactionaries bring out in me (which, admittedly, is reactionary in of itself). You got me all pavlovian in this way and it's to your credit that you make me aware of this natural combative qualities in my own personality as I'm definitely more like Adriana than Tiffany, but to a greater degree, though there's a lot of Abby thrown in there too (militant Marxist me). But by the end of your videos, I always end up completely satisfied and somewhat awed by your rational and brilliant approach to the problems surrounding transpeople, culture as a whole and the social dynamics therein.

"All you need to do to show how ineffective Blaire's approach to trans acceptance is by looking at her comment section. I've never seen so many transphobic and bigoted people on a non-viral video starring a trans person.  What Blaire doesn't notice is how her politics doesn't make people on the Right more comfortable with trans people, it makes them more comfortable talking about _their_ views on trans people--and they're shitty and headache inducing.  There's always some modicum truth to different opinions, like be more patient with people who differ in opinion, but Blaire thinks it does anyone good to let people insult her en masse.

"Ok, on trap.I don't think I have literally ever seen 'trap' using with negative connotations. Even very many lefty trans women. It is a term that did not necessarily originate as negative, unlike slurs like queer, which were mostly reclaimed at this point.'Are Traps Gay' is a question directed at heterosexual men as to whether their heterosexuality is negated as an absolute when they are attracted to someone who passes for a woman. And ultimately, this questions the fundamental basis of sexuality as such, which themselves need to be questioned as dismantled, because words like straight and gay ultimately lose a lot of their meaning, because they can be rather arbitrary.

My friends will often say that 'traps are gay' because 'at the end of they day, it is by definition gay, for a male to be attracted to a man' (unless you didn't know) and that's bullshit. My psych textbook for example explains the phenomenon of sexual attraction by stating that sexual orientation is the sex that people are attracted to. And all that stuff, but I plainly think that's a poor way to explain it because people are not attracted to sex, they are attracted to an amalgamation of secondary sex characteristics and non dimorphic characteristics.

"The feminine penis thing had me rolling on the floor. Sure, it is a thing.. But, to think talking about it in a public forum is helpful in promoting the validity of trans Women being Women is laughable. I thought is was great you included that and trans Lesbians. I like Women, trans or cis, and I see trans Women as type of Woman. The general public on the other hand will seize any opportunity to call us out. So, not everything we say to each other, should be said to the GP at large. It's not being dishonest about ourselves, it's called being discrete and mindful of the objective. That being, we are Women. Period.  I found it funny, because she was being indiscrete and I thought rather foolish to not think about the consequences to other trans Women.

"I think a good trap should be at least somewhat gay. You can't just draw an anime girl and then go 'it's a dude lol', that's for lazy hacks. Traps should combine masculine and feminine features to create an conhesive adrogynous whole that will legitimately confuse you and make you question your sexuality. And while some guys will try to justify it to themselves by saying 'well, i'm only attracted to the feminine parts', the best of traps will make that as hard as possible for them, by masterfully interweaving the two opposites so that they're inseperably tied to one another. So to answer the question : are traps gay? Not always, but they should strive to be.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Genuine question: If you deconstruct everything about what it means to be a man or to be a woman or what body parts one ought to have, what is the point in the end for trans-women to identify as female, when everything they want to change or have changed about them, isn't even considered necessarily female anymore? I always thought trans-women want to be female and also seen as a female. If no body feature or trait actually achieves that anymore, what's the point of transitioning? Also: No offense, but I'm checking out. Have fun debating girl-dick, mouthfeel and what label to assign to a trans-woman/trans-woman relationship, ya'll. You do you, but I'd prefer to just shrug and quietly back off. I'm too old for this. Is that okay?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a Trans Woman, 10 years after transition, I would have to say this is a great video. Lots for people to contemplate. Mostly, I saw myself at various points in my life. The activism, the alcoholism, and the self loathing. I think you've been honest about what is going on in our heads, Natalie, as we try to navigate through society as the people we see ourselves as, mainly Women. But, also feeling outside of the binary of Man and Woman at times. Although, most of us are loathe to say so, myself included, I feel we are different than natal Men or Women. I know, I know, it doesn't help the cause. But we can talk to each other about it, can't we?  Internally, from my point of view, I wasn't raised as a boy, I was raised as a Trans kid. Very scared and messed up. Spending nearly a year of my young life institutionalized because of depression. Not willing to tell a soul about myself, until I opened up to my then wife(1999ish), then I couldn't get the genie back in the bottle, so I hit the bottle. Until, of course, I crashed and had to deal with it. Or die. So I transitioned got divorced, but stayed friends, only to watch her die of cancer (2008). Meanwhile, I met my current partner, who I am still with. The good, the bad, the old, and the new, all happening at the same time. It's kinda boring now, but I'm getting used to it. Life isn't perfect, but it isn't as chaotic either.  All of this leading to me today. 55 years old with a girlfriend, also trans (yea!), of 14 years. I look back and it all could have ended up very badly, on many an occasion. But, it didn't and I'm still here, so I can watch something like this video. I'm glad I made it, and not to sound corny, but YOU CAN TOO. If I could give you any advice, don't be Tiffany. Not everyone is going to like you. Fuck'em! Find the people that do like you, for being you, and stay with them.   Great job as always Natalie. It's great to see you grow and change. So far, you're doing great. Keep the videos coming. Can't wait to talk about this with my partner later. Cheers from the Badgerland.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's really hard video to swallow because although your critique of Blaire and other 'cool trans chicks' is true and should be said, the scenes at the end is too brutal not to get offended by fans, so the message won't get across... In my opinion this one is too controversial.  Also it feels like you shame Blaire for her plastic surgeries. I don't think you yourself think like that, but in this vid you come across like you do. Shaming for any plastic surgeries is disguisting.  Aside from that good vid. Love the aesthetics (as always).  PS: I still think Blaire isn't as bad as you show her to be. Especually after the 'I'm sorry' vid. She calmed down. And her 'Are traps gay' vid is really good. She draws distinction between traps and trans. And she explains the 'not the straightest in the world'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It's empathetic, funny, and heartbreaking and put a lot of thoughts into words (and non-verbal, very gorgeous presentation) that I've had about this topic but never really tapped into.

"Contra I think again nails the subject out of the park.  There is so much going on in this video and many of the points are issues many find to have with the trans movement.  Perhaps the issue is that once again a movement is way too focused on one issue, opposed to doing a broad focus.  Stop making it JUST about trans, but just push for an end to gender specific rules and limits.  Notice how in this vid 'femininity' is being connected to appearance, and styles, and behavior.  THIS is the problem in my eyes.  When a woman is called butch for wearing pants or more 'manly styles' there is a problem.  When a man is called 'sissy' because he chooses to wear so called feminine clothing, there is a problem...and when loving someone of the same sex as yourself is somehow STILL a bad thing...there is a problem.  *** It seems many commenters are thinking this video is an either or sort of vid, or Natalie is making one side look one way, and the other side look another.  I really do think what Natalie was doing...and did well, is that the arguments of the two sides DO conicide, but also that there are some arguments that to those we are trying to see our side of, see as absurd 'female penis, male vagina', for a vast majority these terms put up a wall in conversation.  In my eyes what needs to happen is for a broadening of what it is to be masculine, and what it means to be feminine, and for those that like to express as a mix to be free to do so without threat of losing their job, home, family, friends.  In many ways the trans movement as it is is reinforcing gender rules and limits.  By looking at someone such as myself (a practitioner of androgyny) as 'trans in denial' they are making it like if a man varies from the 'normal' definition of male, he MUST be trans.  If you don't think this is the case, then if you are male, go to your next jury service in a skirt suit..see what happens.  (it will be a good day when this sort of thing is not a factor).  There are too many connections of one's sex or gender with outward appearance and behaviors, and to me the trans movement in too many ways supports these.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I didn't pick up on the racism part worthy of a trigger warning. Though I was mowing the yard while listening to some of this. I thought I'd just throw out my opinion that I think relates to some of the topics discussed in the mock debate...Admittedly, I've not thought extremely far into this stance, but it seems to me that no matter what a trans person does, take Contra for example, they can never become another sex/gender. I almost feel like you can only claim to have changed genders when a scientist could take a sample of your DNA, clone you, and that clone would be a different gender. That's a strange way to put it I suppose, but what I mean is, underneath all of the gender phenotypical add ons (make up, hair, cosmetic surgery, hormones, implants) there are things which cannot be altered even with the cutting edge of modern medicine. I can see how that sort of fundimental incongruity between body and mind and attempts at trying to feel like a woman, to be seen and known as a woman, would be very difficult to handle. I am a man, just a plain ole fashioned man, I've tried to imagine what it would be like to have a female body and still be me, a man. None of what I've said should be mistaken for some kind of ill will towards trans people, the parts of America where I live, I've been the only pro-LGBT progressive libertarian I've met with a few exceptions. I just don't logically or scientifically or biologically or anatomically understand how a man could truly become a woman, and not be a trans women. But I don't need to know, I support the same basic human rights across the board, without a pre-required understanding.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"That was hard to watch in a good way.  I have much empathy with 'tiffany's' who understandably want to pass as what society deems to be female. The enforcement of this narrow view of womanhood however can increase their feeling of not 'belonging'. Its an evil cycle really, if you don't pass 'in the now' you will not be percieved as a woman, but by 'passing in the now' you're reinforcing the narrow perception of what womanhood is thereby increasing your dysphoria. Its a really hard subject but you tackled it perfectly.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

There actually IS a huge shortage of that, ask any Trans person, check out Tinder or w/e, look at the ratios of Trans escorts to straight-fem escorts, disparity in cost and number are represented by massive over-saturation of the market. Truth is, at the end of the day, most gay men prefer other gay men, most straight men prefer actual women....      you can play language games around the issue all you want, at the end of the day, no straight men are interested in your 'girl-dick', which is an insane term.

"I really loved this video! I was just thinking about how great the other more fiction pieces you do are, and just how great your acting has become. Tiffany is very compelling, and Adria is a lovely protagonist. Her spikiness feels like it's meant to come off as unnecessarily harsh, until the video shows that she's justified in refusing to engage with either Tiffany or Jackie because neither of them are there for her, and she knows that neither of them will listen. Just as she is ineffective against them, both Janet and Tiffany are clearly powerless in their own lives. This is implied with Jackie, but I really loved the exploration of Tiffany. I felt so tense while watching her at home, it felt as though she were in danger of being hurt or hurting herself. The vulnerability was so well contrasted with her adamant denial of her status of a victim. The tragedy that taking ownership of her victimhood would actually help her become a little more empowered and dignified is so well done! Especially when for all the humiliation of identifying with slurs and trying to appease a patriarchal society that'll never accept her, this rejection is instant. Sorry to ramble, I just adore this video! I think watching Tiffany and Abigail (the TERF), and Adria and your Abigail interact would also be really fascinating! I really love how your characters aren't just personifications of political points of view, they really feel alive!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
