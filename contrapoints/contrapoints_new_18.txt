I was initially reluctant to do a video on this topic in part because I worried that only a handful of trans women and TERFs would even care. It’s a video about the identity and sexuality of trans women, yes, but the debate around this topic touches on a lot of other issues that are of wide interest right now: political correctness, academic freedom, power, privilege, social justice, postmodernism. And I try to make connections to those debates in this video, so my hope is that even if you’re not trans you’ll still resonate with enough that it’ll be worth watching for 50 minutes.  Failing that at least there’s filth. 🌸
Uhm, I got here from there: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pxxBQm114k&ab_channel=RT Not sure about all this new "gender" stuff. I think we still know very little.
33:37 " women do not get turned on merely by the thought of being women" I'm a ciswoman and I personally disagree.Growing up and in my teens I would feel sexual about feeling/being seen as a beautiful feminine woman. Maybe that messed up but thats for another day!! I only started to have sexual feelings about men like in 6th grade or so before that I didn't care about that at all. I'm not saying this is something  everybody goes through but I think for some woman's gender development and growth of sexuality could be a kind of autogynofillia situation which would explain why trans women feel this way too. So basically I think ciswomen go through a similar thing and trans woman are being demonised for going through the same exact thing.  I've grown out of it for the most part and my sexuality has been more outward oriented so that makes me think maybe its just a stepping stone in my sexual development.  Lots of people feel insecure about not measuring up to the standards of their gender. So i think getting turned on by people seeing you as masculine or feminine turns you on because it validates your identity and makes you feel worthy?? ive had loads of anxiety about not being feminine enough so that could be part of it as well. just some thoughts!!! xoxo <3
Just posting this comment to say that i'm really thankful for your work because you have taught me in your videos a great lot of things that i, as a cis male, would have never thought of. I'm glad someone send me here. You have all my support, for the little it's worth, i wish you and all trans people to simply live like you want and enjoy your lives.
_Major_ props to you for putting all this out there. That really does take guts.
also: "what is known in the trans community as a 'joke' "
I'm sorry I'm fangirling over literally every one of your vids but I love philosophy, you understand it better than I do, and you can calmly and legitimately make sense of theories that would leave me flailing with arms of "what????" Also I'm a white cis lesbian detoxing from opioids and your voice is soothing to my stupid head while my body tries to reassert homeostasis.
Well.. yes this is good fodder for terfs. Most terfs already know what autogynephelia is.. but having it explained by a trans woman is probably a new angle.   More to the point.. the current case of Janiv/Jonathan (can't remember last name) in Canada is an example of a fetishist posing as a woman to gain access to female spaces (autogynephelia with a little pedophilia on the side.) Janiv is a total degenerate, you see. And unfortunately, though his behavior may be rare, it's exactly the kind of thing people would legitimately want to steer clear of and keep their children away from.  I'm using both names (Janiv/Jonathan) interchangeably because Jonathan does also. He also seems happy to not physically transition but who knows.  The thing is... it's the Jonathans of the world that make folx skeptical about certain rules and regulations regarding women's spaces and the presence of trans women - without even mentioning sports. Just throwing it out there because it's very much relevant to this topic, even though this video is old.  Because of the behavior of certain people, we should honestly consider rolling back our insistence that "if I say I'm a woman I'm a woman." That may be fine and dandy in social circumstances, but we really ought to examine our consciences when we advocate for that to be law. I never thought I'd say that but the more I learn the more skeptical I am. Idk if you've already covered this topic,  so plz forgive if so. I'm in the process of going through your videos.   Did you know, in England,  they made a gender privacy law that is so absolute it guarantees you a new identity when you "declare" your intention to live as a woman? Guess what happened not long after? A sex offender walked away from their name and identity, with legal protections so strong anyone who gave her away would've been jailed.... "she" then reoffended... and waa sent to female prison.. where she reoffended. I believe "she" is still in female prison because they would have to roll back all the privacy bullshit to put her in men's prison where she belongs.  Whatever a person's reasons are for doing a disingenuous transition... we can't deny it happens... and we should seriously consider the legal aspects of "rewarding" transitions and achieving acknowledging them based on "declarations." If you did a follow up video about these issues I'd be very appreciative.  Navigating all this is crazy.  A lot of folx like me have no one to talk about it with because everyone is so knee-jerk about it,  whether they be extreme in one direction or the other. Our current social/political climate doesn't exactly foster open conversations. I spent 30 years honing my conversation skills and talking to people from all backgrounds.. just to be bested by phones, apathy,  and a seeming communal anger and disregard for discourse 😔 Please help 💔 The planet is dying and somehow we've come to an utter stand still over how to speak to each other.. or when.. if at all
AND JUST A STEP TO THE RIIIIGHT
lol, does he even read science? How do you explain that: "Conclusions: Untreated MtFs and FtMs who *have an early onset of their gender dysphoria and are sexually oriented to persons of their natal sex* show a distinctive brain morphology, reflecting a brain phenotype. These phenotypes are different from those of heterosexual males or females; the differences affect the right hemisphere and cortical structures underlying body perception. The genesis of these phenotypes might be caused by atypical effects of sex hormones or their metabolites in specific cortical regions of MtFs and FtMs. These effects of hormones on the cortex suggest the hypothesis that brain differences between homosexual MtFs and FtMs and male and female controls are due to differences in the development of the cortex; this hypothesis would imply that the thinning process undergone by some regions of the cortex is timed differently in each phenotype.  *The review of the available data seems to support two existing hypotheses: (1) a brain-restricted intersexuality in homosexual MtFs and FtMs and (2) Blanchard’s insight on the existence of two brain phenotypes that differentiate “homosexual” and “nonhomosexual” MtFs.*"
IT'S TRUE. Not in all cases. BUT. True of too many who wants access to women's toilets. ('Blanchard' is a born-female AGENT. Ignore that creep.)  I lived with a man exactly like this, for 12 years, and have known many others. Even hearing a word such as 'panties' can send them through the roof. No point in denying it.
So is there a version of this for transmen? Hm
I need to know the name of the opera she was singing at the start of the video! Does anyone know?
what's up with the need that cis heterosexual men have to compulsively analyse and explain women's sexuality all the fucking time???????
This describes Traps ....cluster A ? Cluster B.....psychopaths?
Wow, your backstory section literally described me. I've honestly never heard anyone else voice thoughts like 18:44-19:14 until now and it sure is validating to hear that I'm not the only one. As a trans woman who's been aware of her identity for a long time but has only started transitioning recently, the confusion is so real.
Your video rocks but also fifty shades is about cultist behavior.
“Bailey are you paying attention to this? This is for you” I cackled 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I appreciate the trill at the end of the song :')
Theres a lot of generalizing and painting going on- not all leftists or LGBTQ+ people are automatically going to mob or cry over the tiniest inconvenience..
Damn no NB people allowed? Welp gonna watch this whole thing anyway
Contrapoints referenced RLM and my brain melted
As a non-binary Columbia, the fact that ContraPoints used be play Frank N Furter makes my life
What's the aria at the beginning of the video?? Sounds like something Baroque??
Watching ContraPoints while waiting for drugs to kick in is like hoping that, by the next video, you no longer understand what she's saying.
http://www.annelawrence.com/ it fucking looks like shit i made in my 7th grade computer class
The Fuck Saw......LOL
A thought I had on the whole Type A/Type B thing. While we don't know the causes of gender dysphoria but there is a good to fair chance that it is hormonal in some way. While it isn't a smoking gun but the presence of estrogen seems to be common. There are two main ways that men can develop estrogen in their system. The first is simply to have large amounts of estrogen in the body in addition or at the expense of testosterone. The second is where men who produce more testosterone than normal sometimes have a chance of some of it turning to estrogen. Its pretty common for older men that take testosterone supplements to have estrogen spikes.   So it seems like it might be possible that the presence of estrogen during developmental stages in both types of transgender women happen at the same time. But the trans women that naturally had low testosterone will find the need to transition early. The secondary would have estrogen but also plenty of testosterone till around age 25-30 when it first starts to drop.   I don't know. This is just a thought I had during this. It would have no bearing on the sexuality or fetishes. Which is of course why autogynephilia is bullshit. So it seems likely that someone did look at some very real trends of data but through a thick lens of misandry/sexism/trans-phobia/white heterosexual cis male clueless-ness.
Second time i seen this video, and is like the first one. Never the same river, and like always, it feels like drinking a book. You are a beautiful and amazing person Natalia. Thank you for existing.
Awww. This smile after the ending song is so cute)
This is about the most intimately profound dialogue with sexuality, gender, sex and the body I’ve ever witnessed. Why don’t we talk to each other about our dysphoria and our intimate relationships and how it revealed/formed us as human beings? I’m a cis bi (omni) woman and still, I felt parts of this so deeply as related to my own private and personal experiences (that got to stay private and personal bc privilege, but also, why?). This channel does what so much great art does, which is to find in the deeply specific that which resonates on a fundamental human level. I hope that Natalie gets ten times the artistic, intellectual, spiritual and community fulfillment back for the phenomenal personal effort and vulnerability she puts into this work.
I really wish it was protocol for first grade science teachers, worldwide, on the first day of class, to teach the scientific meaning of the word "theory" because I can't think of a single word in the English language more misused.  Anyway: if Blanchard's "theory" isn't falsifiable it's not a theory. It's barley a hypothesis. And I'm, by no means, correcting CP, who's substantially more educated then me. I'm correcting Blanchard's quackery.
Over a year too late but I'm 100% cis, was born with vagina and xx chromosomes and I've definitely gone through phases where I wore bras to bed. It's mostly related to like, being in situations where other people might reasonably see me? And it's uncomfortable to be out in the world without a bra on. So no one can bother you about it because IT HAPPENS
I love those flowerprint shoes!
An AGP tries to debunk AGP theory while showing all of the classic signs of AGP. This video is fascinating to watch.
love watching your videos and drinking wine straight from the bottle i.. am drunk
Am I the only cis woman who sleeps in a bra?
8:27 Sex Robot? I get the feeling that the author started writing a cyberpunk novel and forgot he was supposed to be doing scientific research.
7:47 I started laughing. This guy sounds like a parody of Harry Dresden describing his latest sexy client.
Blanchard is like that guy on the bench in the park in "Great Muppet Caper" who tries to explain Kermit's life and gets every single thing wrong.
P-Please fuck me...hahaha...love it
I like your approach to Bailey's
So the main argument proferred against autogynemhilia is that it's so complicated that even men wouldn't trouble to go through the process?
This went in so many directions and I honestly have never been more pleased.
I'm sis but you have helped me understand trans people. Thank you
You're amazing Natalie
Sooooooo, we can expect how-to-homemade-sex-robot YouTube channels then? I'm asking for research purposes.
Dont worry Natalie, im a cis woman and i still sleep in a bra lol
...since when is it weird for cis women to try on high heels, lingerie, and sexy clothing in front of a mirror and sigh while wondering if anybody would fuck them? It's clear that for a trans woman this is an expression of gender dysphoria, so the motivation is very different from that of a cis woman. But feeling unhappy with one's body, fearing that one isn't fuckable, and dressing to feel more fuckable is a pretty normal part of the human experience, is it not? And, so far as I'm aware, sort-of objectifying oneself, performing a hyper-feminine or hyper-sexualized version of femininity that doesn't necessarily come naturally, is a part of both the cis and the trans woman's experience of trying to feel valid in a society that strictly polices bodies and genders.
24:10 Are you kidding?! I am ETERNALLY fascinated with my erect penis! It’s FUCKING MASSIVE, and even women struggle to take a quarter of it are turned on by it. I’m not even particularly skilled with. I just like my dick’s dimensions. If it didn’t shrink so much while flaccid, it could be mistaken for a weapon.  I’ve destroyed enough vaginas to warrant the implied threat, though.
My little sister sleeps in a bra (but that’s just because she’s fucking gross and sometimes too lazy to change before going to bed)
Im a cis woman but i love bdsm aesthetics lol
I guarantee you the fireplace is not made of platinum. Sorry, couldn't help myself. 😂😂
Eww now I've got to change my name!!
I had to pause the video a few times to truly appreciate the flagrantly circular, purposefully unfalsifiable and self-contradictory reasoning of Blanchard
Wauw the video's you make are so personal, funny and interesting to watch, you are a really beautiful and creative lady🤗. Your video's have learned me things about being a woman and also understanding it better from different perspectives. Thank you ❤️
This video is bringing back memories of my 17 year old self when I thought trans-people were just ashamed of being gay. Why was I so dumb?
Natalie... I badly want you.
people who are autogynephilic just have a crossdresser/gender play kink Aka: they like to dress up as the opposite gender and get horny off being call that gender.  This is just an fyi my bdsm ass knows about.
How dare you Natalie! Dogs do go to heaven! I am so disappointed! 😭🤣
Your videos are incredible. Never even heard of this before
Her argument both destroyed Blanchard's theory and validates transgenderism with her experiences. Thank you for being a visible trans person.
Where group cluster C, geniphile and transitioning early in life? More and more trans folks hitting that these days.
Read about the fucksaw thing and in response Bailey deadass said "Sticks and stones may break your bones, but watching naked people on stage doing pleasurable things will never hurt you," .......my guy
i do experience mild arousal at the thought of transition...then agsin i was fondling my cock at the time...
1:01 i am a gay man who loves themself
2/10 not enough filth
As a classically trainer singer, Natalie always chooses bomb fucking music!!!!
I used to talk to this person I met on a music forum. They eventually told me that they were trans. I was curious, so I asked more as I considered this person a friend. To cut a long story short, I did some digging and found out they were a porn addict and the sites and "support groups" they used to go on fed into this - from my perspective all of these people had their minds altered heavily by pornography and the "novelty" of trans-as-sex-objects. When that wore thin they moved onto "transitioning". It was very dark and strange to me. I remember on one forum my friend would go on, a thread of a person showing pictures of their post-op genital area and everyone fawning over it and clearly expressing arousal, excited for their own surgeries. They would also post pictures of "bimbos" and say things like "god I wish I was a dumb bimbo slut" and yeah, I found it very disturbing. If anyone's curious to see this effect in action, just go onto r/nofap and search for "trans" or "autogynephilia" or "bimbofication" [srs] to see some very dark stories.   Great video though, it helps me understand what I witnessed a little better. Very happy I found your channel - It answers a lot of the questions I've had about these issues but was too afraid to ask!
The trail is actually so funny
Wow she looks hella good in a judge wig. It's miraculous :D
literally you are so beautiful holy shit i've became obsessed with your videos!
i'd fuck contrapoints.
Only gyne I think of is a specific caste of the family Formicidae, and other Hymenoptera families.
Okay I looked up the fucksaw incident and wow but I never got a WHY? WHY GOD WHY?
Who is this blue woman
Damn you`re so good at playing a piano
And WHO doesnt Love a little 'Time Warp'. .....Baby?
Your Honor, may it please the court, may I just say, Don't we all bleed in Truth,don't we ALL bleed?
There are tines when am autogynophiliac is jist  a... Oh, forget it, it's not funny, at all......
26:50 s a lesbian, the words "interpersonal arousal cues," "intimate physical contact," and "close emotional moments" collectively raised my heart rate by like 30%
Oi I distinctly heard the Dance of Knights in that original music...
Another great video (just found your channel recently and love it), but... err... men's bodies are great but "not that great"? To whom, cis straight women? I beg to differ, lol, and I've written plenty of erotic fiction to prove it. I think the gay men who "took over the reading" of Playgirl would beg to differ too. :) Sorry, it's just another area of over generalization and misinformation, while we're on the subject. There are a great many women attracted to men who are very visually stimulated by men's bodies and think they're the end-all be-all. Many of us think Playgirl didn't take off because, from the get-go it wasn't anything like what Playboy offered men, but rather assumed incorrectly that what we all wanted was romance and flowery language, or, as you stated, to be "swept off our feet" or whatever. Ridiculous. (DNA is a much better, straight-to-the-point mag. Of course, it caters mainly to men who are attracted to men, because "women don't really actually think men's bodies are that great". Sigh.) Fifty Shades was "one woman's fantasy" (author's own statement) that earned so much money it only served to perpetuate these types of myths by gargantuan leaps and bounds. Most of the straight women I know found it patronizing. <3
i started binge-watching your videos yesterday and i think my life is kinda changed. my viewpoint isn`t but there certainly are some things that i was for years wondering about and now know better. so thank you so much and omg you are a fantastic person and creator. (sincerely, a 20-year-old cis-gendered woman from Russia who often feels genuinely autophilic lol)
Backside!!!!!!!! There's a 'Play Girl' Magazine???????
Semele is some seriously deep Handel cuts.
11.) The study of color gel lights
oooh! OOh! you should do a piece on the theories of Black Mirror's Striking Vipors and cross sex gender fantasy
U totally remind me of it's always sunny in Philadelphia 💘
hey is that peter 'many' coffin
Oh my god, she's 10 years older than me. I hope I still look this young when I'm 30.
What is the song you're singing?
Why are these "scientists" using sample sizes that would cause you to fail a high school statistics project. If you're going to be bigoted at least don't be lazy
Ur not supposed to talk about agp😩😭
I'm so confused (with myself)
I know a cis woman who wears her bra at night because she's convinced her boobs will sag more if she doesn't. lol
I’m a cis woman, but I’ve never been comfortable in my own skin and while directed at trans women, this video did help me a lot. It kind of helped me process my sexuality, something that I have previously been unable to do. So thank you!
I'm just here, scarred after googling the fucksaw ...
This is just “gaslighting - the scientific journal “. Quiet trans people, let me explain to you what your motivations are and anything you say that doesn’t align with this is clearly lies!
This entire argument always makes me laugh when I hear it, as it is immediately debunked by the existence of bisexuality.
Michael Bailey is a man who would be scientist
Great video, you've really helped me understand trans Women!
i love u AGPpoints but ur wrong tbh
It’s not that you don’t like being misrepresented, it’s that all of this that you’ve changed about your body to become a woman might not be from the pure desire to be free to live as you live, as a woman. It might actually have roots you haven’t considered before in your sexuality, and that threatens what you’ve come to accept as your identity. Just because you think and feel what you think and fucking feel DOES NOT MEAN YOURE RIGHT ABOUT JACK SHIT. Female vanity goes beyond the physical and into the intellectual when women try to carve space in scientific conversations for woo-wooey emotional epithets and try to make everyone else cow tow to their feelings. Don’t say anything that might upset trans people is a terrible way to live. You are narcissistic, and you’re very angry.
I relate to every every I repeat EVERYTHING you said in the filth section. Until the part where you actually transition. Then it all became you found this, you like this and not this, you FEEL this or that. You want the female perspective of sex. At the end of section 8, you say you want other people to look at you and think you’re sexy. Is that not the wish to be perceived as a sexy woman? That seems like autogynephillia to me, as I personally experience it. And that’s what fills your emotional holes inside? Let’s see if you’re still feeling that way when you age, okay? And I’ll see how I feel when I age in my body the way it was meant to develop.
@3:10 evidence that transitioning is actually a valid treatment for gender dysphoria please?
24:11 Hey, I do enjoy my body odour! Y u kinkshaming me Natalie?
White upperclass Terf: "your not really a woman because you haven't suffered the same way as me"  Lesbians, POC, poor women: "You hear sumthin?"
Please Natalie, love thyself!
TRANCE- planing
As a cis male, Autogynephilia seems to apply to me more than it does any trans person. Not because I want to be trans due to love of myself or love of men (though I do love me and men) but, rather cuz I tots fuck girl me, would u fuck girl me? I think I would.
if it makes you feel better, I'm a cis woman who sleeps in a bra because I'm too lazy to take it off and don't want my sad boobs to escape my pyjama top in the night.
LOVED every minute of it, but specially the cadence with all and its tremblement at the end of the song.
“Man! I feel like a woman” - thanks to Shania Twain for further muddying the water
*googles "fucksaw incident"*   Classy, Mr. Bailey. Very, very classy.
So I just googled the fucksaw incident...  Is that woman okay???
OMG I found this homophobic parenting book just like that, well written and convincing it freaked me out so much that I lit it on fire
7:19 Is that Falcon from Gameranx???
This is the video that made me subscribe
I'm a cis-woman and I used to wear a bra in bed throughout like my whole teenage years. Idk why... Hm. 😅
I'm really glad to have found this video and I think I'm going to learn something very important from it, but I'll have to come back to it later because I have to Google the fuck saw incident immediately.
there needs to be a wiki page dedicated to all of contrapoints' characters and alter-egos
Older video so I don't know if you'll see this, but I would love a video on Alice Dreger. I love her work with intersex people but this Bailey thing... yeesh.
Love you so much.   Occam'rs razor is the best advice for my sex life ever.  I'm just a man that wants to get fucked once in a while.; And sometimes wants to fuck someone.  God.  your video made me realise I've been obsessed with finding a partner who validates me as a man  and that makes no sense, because then I can only start being a man when I get a man.   I'm learning that it works better this way: focus on what I want. Purely what I enjoy in a partner. And then I ask for that AND DON't SETTLE.  And then spend half a year crying in bed and going on grindr to SETTLE and then cry again because validation through other people doesn't freakin work anymore so now I gotta actually go fukkin find it in myself AND THATS NO PICKNICK.   But it work!!! After a purge of losers and assholes.   FREAK  SHOW   been there, done that, bought a t-shirt.  got crabs, gono and suddenly taking viagra to be sure.   what.   It works though.
The ‘WAKE ME UP INSIDE’ bit killed me
Huh, so I am the only cis-woman to wear a bra in bed? Neat to know. Anyway, I've recently started watching your videos and I want to say you're doing a great job, you're really informative and I love your aesthetic.
_as a cis woman_ I used to sleep in a bra during my adolescence.
I had no idea that trans issues ran this deep, or that the bias/phobes etc were like this. Thank you for educating someone who started with little or no knowledge but is learning.
damn he's pretty
I think Im a Cluster B trans or nonbinary somethin
Thanks for sharing your perspective, it’s hard to put into words but I related to being turned on by myself but not for just being female but the idea of being desirable.
I love your videos so much. I actually want to hang out with you because you are awesome, smart, and cool!
I sleep in my bra if I'm too lazy to change my shirt before bed or because I was too lazy to find a soft shirt to sleep in lol
this was my first video ive seen from you. it was wonderful, I learned a lot
I have A LOT of cis female friends who sleeps with their bra on. So, that's super normal. I personally don't like it, but they say it's conformable.
Is that falcon from gameranx
i'm afab and i sleep in a bra (a sports bra) lol
@ContraPoints I was really surprised that this was about trans women (sorry). It seemed such a good description of that eighties thing where people say to truelly be an enlightened women and shake off the oppression of the patriarchy you have to get to know your body, and really fall in love with yourself and your vagina.  It still hangs on as an idea in some feminist circles. So I was expecting this to be some sort of refutation of that idea, that not every woman has to be sexually attracted to themself to be a valid woman. So then this other weird idea that trans women are not really women but just men in lust with themselves as women is... hilariously surprising and maddening in the way it tries to other you...? It blindsided me I was so expecting this to be a terf thing!?  I don't know, maybe a large subsection of all women are autogynaphiles to some extent? And if you were an autogynaphilic trans woman you could join in a subsection of feminism that I can't as a non autogynaphilic sis girl, but many sis girls do. I really think you had a great point about how he should have researched feminine sexuallity first, the whole book would probably have had to be scrapped though, because it was taking it as read that trans sexuallity HAD to be different than other female sexuallity.  It seems to be more of a trend of bad studies of feminine sexuality which prioritize an outsiders point of view (the male gaze) over what women themselves experience or say (We'Re All lYiNg AboUt OuRsElvEs!). My thoughts... don't know if they're helpful to anyone.
Love your channel! :-) As a gay man I can fully identify with the female sexuality you have described. Wish you all the best! :)
People should be turned on by their own bodies!! - I may have learned it as a way to get aroused from shagging too many dogs. I do recommend it tho !!Not shagging dogs!! 😘 Moisturise! X Many thanks for the Great video!!
wow... as a lesbian transgender woman, this is one of the best videos I've ever seen.  It really helped me to make sense of my experiences (including how my own sexuality have changed since I started transitioning), especially to understang how this "autoginefilia" theory has harmed me, making me feel guilty about my own body and desires, for so many years. I've actually postponed to start transitioning because, as a feminist "it felt wrong to fetichize womanhood". Took me sometime to understand how wrong this theory was, how it distorted my experiences, and that I was living something entirely different. I'm really grateful to you, for your courage, knowing that is not easy at all to talk about this, sharing so much about yourself. Hope we can find all the love we deserve along our journeys.. You're incredible... thank you <3
What do you make of the recent "trend" of trans YouTubers making detransitioning videos? Is it transphobic propaganda? I'm inclined to believe that for many trans people, the pressure to always be "on" with regards to gender performance is exhausting... but I wonder whether some people who transition confuse what is just a fetish for legitimate gender dysphoria... and even writing that out FEELS icky and transphobic but I'm legitimately curious.
In a timeless world, you could have some of my homemade baileys and a Gladiolus. Cheers to an existence not alone. smiling.
Did I just heard dance of the knights in the beginning?
Conclusion: an overly educated white cis male mansplains being trans. He is just that valid.
Cis woman here...I sleep in a bra!😂
I'm in love 😭
Sister, you're really fine. I know it's not going to change the way you feel about yourself, but you're a beautiful and smart and wonderful woman and there aren't many out there who can speak as eloquently as you while being genuinely funny and pleasant to listen to. I mean, I love a bunch of female comedians, but the things you talk about hit so much closer to home for me than anything a comedian could say, and I'm not trying to appropriate trans experiences but the way you speak about your own experiences and thoughts is so familiar to me even though I haven't the vocabulary or intelligence to express myself the way you do.  I guess it's called kinship?  I don't live in your country, but if I did I would definitely be going out for drinks with you. You sound fun and a delight to be around, and I'm being 100% honest here.    This said, S L A Y  S I S
I remember in the book The Silence of the Lambs, the investigation lead them to some kind of medical establishment frequented by transgender people. There, a doctor tell them that yes the crazy guy went there asking for a "sex change", but was refused because the psychological tests showed he was a crazy violent dingus. He then, if I remember correctly, describes trans people as the most peaceful people that can be met.  That passage stuck with me, because it made so much sense then. Of course trans people would be just well, people.  The crazy homicidal people cutter that happens to not like his dick is just that- a crazy homicidal person. I can't believe people use a fiction book to portray trans people as deranged, when the fiction book itself knows better.
Perfection itself.
I so love the hip-hop Wendy Carlos take on Prokofiev during the opening credits <3
Cis woman, I wear a sleep nursing bra. I usually wear a sleep bras as well BECAUSE it makes me feel more feminine. I have body dysmorphic disorder and when I wake up, and see my large breasts, ravaged by pregnancy, nursing, and of course gravity, laying near my round, giggly, post baby stomach, it makes me feel gross, frumpy and like I could sloppily be rolled from one room to the next.   So in order to not wake up feeling gross, I wear a sleep bra because it keeps my large breasts, relatively, in place and in about the generalized location of normal human breast's.   In short: you're not weird for wearing a bra to sleep. 💜
I love you and your videos, but I just came here to say it made me really happy to watch you sing and play Time Warp. I love that you were Frankenfurter back in the day and I'm sure you were glorious. I was Riff Raff at the Bryn Mawr College production of Rocky Horror in 2009. <3
contra this is your masterpiece <3
Hi Natalie, great video. Hope this isn't an offensive question but being so musical have you considered learning counter-tenor vocal technique? Or have hormones affected your registers? Anyways, thank you for sharing this one. It must've been tough.
This is really interesting to me, spaciohicully the part when talking about male vs female sexuality, I (unsurprisingly as I'm nonbinary) found myself relating to both the wanting a man and being manted my a man, as well as being mostly dirven by written and imagined works, while still having some interest in visuals. Just somthing interesting for me personally
How can we socially transition when no one will talk to a trans person. My experience is social issolation (in every form).  As Shane Dawson says: that social issolation is the definition of hell. I'm living in hell. IDK how to change it.
I just want to say thank you so much for this video, I have seen it several times and it is helping add a lot of humour to a difficult topic I am debating with a number of psychologists/counsellors about AGP and conversion therapy. I needed this to regain my sanity... thank you, you mean so much to myself and others in the community...
My husband came out to me as transgender in 1982. We divorced 3 yrs later.  I spent the last 40 years wondering  about why he thinks he is a woman when none of his behaviour was like a woman and he did not want to date men. Yes he was obsessed with wearing my  sexiest clothing and going out in public looking like a woman. But he has never behaved as a women. He was obsessed with me affirming that he was more attractive than I was! (not too fun as a wife)  Most women don't sit around obsessing around their appearance as much as he did. When I heard of autogynophiliea I thought WOW that answers exactly my ex husbands motiviations and reasons for thinking he was a woman. He is not a woman in a man's body, he is just turned on by looking like a sexy woman.  He also was very narcissistic which was no big surprise since my mother is narcissist personality disordered. He had grandiose ideas such as actually believing he looked like a woman. (he did not).  I wonder why these transgender people don't confront all the pain they inflict on others like their wives and children. I have since met other trans women. While I have compassion for them I wonder why the rest of us have to twist ourselves around to their "truth" which is really, that their sexiual philias. BTW this is the one and only post I have ever made and don't plan on checking anyone's responses so you can save your breath. I think videos like this actually prove the fact that these people are narcisstic disordered. These people are so  harmful to others who are not aware of this disorder.
What is a good alternative for "autogynephilia" when not talking about transsexuality, but rather the fetish where you get sexually aroused by the thought of becoming a woman and it's not related to transsexuality? Is it better to just explain it outright? I have that fetish but i don't want to be misunderstood and upset them.
Your videos are LONG and I'm still engaged throughout. So informative while being entertaining. I'm so glad I found this channel!
Gender dysphoria should be treated with counselling, not by doctors giving into the delusion. There are two sexes — male and female. And these sexes, by itself, don't mean anything. You can wear whatever dresses you want, you can bake all the cake you want even when you're male. You have a mental illness, get counselling, don't mutilate yourself with harmful dosages of hormones, and don't reset the feminist movement.
@46:40 - "So I have to hope for the sake of my own happiness that someday I will be loved by someone who thinks of me as a woman. Otherwise I am fucked." Beautifully put.
Trannyism is a mental illness born at least in part out of severe narcissism. It is disgusting and unnatural and we as a society should not be encouraging these sickos. Mutilate your own body into a Frankenstein's monster that will fall apart anyway as soon as you begin to age if you want, but DO NOT go around telling other people that abusing yourself in such a way is a good or healthy thing to do. Stay the FUCK away from children as well, freak.
My favorite is when Natalie breaks character for a second and gives us that authentic laugh.
Why are people so obsessed with male to female trans people, but so little is drawn toward female to male trans people. For want of a better way of putting it. I know a part of it is, it's ok to act masculine no matter who you are. I.e. patriarchy. But really why is it so easily swept under the carpet.
wait is it not normal for females to orgasm everyday
@ContraPoints you're attractive! I found your channel and knew you were a woman from the start.  Your clarification of being trans did actually catch me off guard though! As such it was enlightening, thanks for the long term education you've provided to many of us willing to learn.
Where'd you get the wallpaper?
once Blanchard mentioned souls, he lost me. being attracted to men (when born a man) is just a random mutation that results in a spectrum of behaviour. originally, evolution came upon male/female combination by accident as a way to mutate quicker when environment changes quickly. otherwise, when mutation produces no advantage (stable environment)  then female only self-reproduction is energy cheapest. therefore, big idea, it's natural for mutations to chance towards a female self reproduction spectrum. only we cannot self reproduce. dressing up evolution with crappy higher ideas results in bs.

I’m a cis woman and despise being braless. Absolutely loathe not wearing a bra
Many trans women report being autogynephiliacs, and recent MRI brain scans in a 2011 study have confirmed his theory. Additionally,  Lambert's Recent research was used to confirm autogynephilia by exploring  crossdreaming fantasies in cis hetero persons, so if such fantasies exist in the quote-unquote normal population, why wouldn't they exist in the trans population? I also appreciate the narcissistic  rage  Theory you put forth, given another recent study has found that 57% of trans sexual women have narcissistic personality disorder traits. Come at me sis.
I just want Natalie to give me a big hug tbh
Scientific positivism at its worse
Are you a Pisces?
Oh my god we're the same age, I thought you were a lot younger. Lucky.

God Natalie I honesty love you so much and find you so beautiful and powerful :') I really respect the strength and bravery it takes to be so vulnerable and open with your deep and dark fears and feelings.
I looked it up;). I think the students in this day in age could use the internet for an observation into “extreme engineering pleasures mechanisms.” Funny story though and gives insight into the professor’s true academic rigger of study.
My friend argues that female sexuality is more empathetic than male sexuality. Something I think you essentially described here. I don't share that experience personally, but idk. Maybe you're right.
That took guts, thank you for sharing.
I cannot see her wall paper as anything with evil screaming clowns...
Can you do a video on the medicalization of trans/NB people?
41:22 I'm not only loving the song, I'm loving she's HATING IT
11:18 I googled it. What the *fuck*
I'm a cis straight woman and you're spot on about what turns me on. I want to be wanted, chosen, enjoyed.   Also, I love you and your channel so much. Thank you for the good you're putting into the world.
Lots of cis women sleep in bras...generally cis women with larger breasts...which I know nothing about
Natalie you are so beautiful and amazing and smart
I wish I could help make you happy Natalie. Would sending some chocolate your way help?
The fucking voice doing the reading litterally caused me to uncontrollably cringe Jesus Christ
I understand women's sexuality better because of this video. Honestly couldn't care less what people identify as as long as they feel empowered and happy.
I feel this hard, though the female-to-male version...in day to day interactions, when performing on stage, and even in physical relations, shit just don’t feel right. I’m scared, I don’t know what to do, or how to feel about it... maybe I’ll figure out when I’m nearing 30 like you did. I just turned 21 today, actually. But for now, I’m too scared to just out and go “I’m a trans male”. I just refer to myself as a transvestitic gay sea captain or a male lesbian for funsies but in all honesty...I don’t know... but I’ll defer for now. I’ll figure it out. So far only my best friend and little sister know that I may be something other than “non-binary”, and it’ll stay that way for the moment. And maybe these feelings will go away and I’ll settle into some amorphous, yet content identity. Or maybe the dysphoria will finally become too much, and I’ll either finally kill myself, or become born anew—but with a dick this time. Wish me luck, Natalie...
Actually, lots of cis women are into fancy lingerie, and up until the 60s, garter belts, fishnets, and thigh highs were pretty common among women. That’s a stereotype that only cross dressers and trans women dress like that. I know so many women who still wear these things to feel sexy.
As soon as you started describing Cher's antics, I thought 'huh, seems like something Contra would do'. Glad we're on the same page lol
I honestly only think of you as a woman! I can’t even watch your pre-transition videos anymore! I can’t explain it fully, other than to say: you are a woman, that is all!!
I looked up the fucksaw incident and JESUS CHRIST, Bailey.
"Someone please fuck me." Me at this point of my life.
You know, I used to wear a bra to bed when I was a teenager. My reason was that if I didn't, then I would forget to wear a bra during the day and it was puberty and I definitely needed to wear a bra. I don't anymore because it's uncomfortable, but I had a friend who still wore a bra to bed for a while (idk she might still, we don't talk anymore). I don't know her reason, but it's not overly unusual for us cis women to sometimes wear bras to bed, at least in my experience.
I do think autogynephiles exist but I don’t think they’re trans women. I think they’re two different things, cis autogynephile men, and trans women.
I actually know many women who sleep in bras.  I do not partake in that madness, but I also am part of the itty bitty titty committee.  The best line is definitely "These shoes are cute, and I will finally be able to hit my head on the top of door frames"   Natalie, you are awesome.  So smart, funny, witty, and heart-breakingly open.  I know this is an old video and I am more in the know of your current antics, but your story is so honest and I appreciate you.
"Well done, Bailey. You found an honest to god pervert!"
I wish I hadn't deleted those comments. They were valid.  The most pertinent of which I will re-share. "Thank you, Dark Mother. I needed correcting on this for real and for true. I have never studied Blanchard particularly, but I had erroneously reached somewhat similar conclusions of my own volition."  As a white cis male, I hope I can be forgiven for my mischaracterizations. I'm trying.
Amazing work, I broke down at the end. I simply admire you.
This reminds me of when I first started learning about trans and enbie folks - age 18 - and I was trying not to be a shitlord about it because I couldn't imagine what it was like. At some point I realized "well, I can't imagine what it's like to grow up in Vietnam. Does that mean Vietnam is imaginary?" And that's how I learned to shut up and listen to people who are different than me lol  I prefer chocolate chip cookies, thank you.
Wait, you people don't all have mirrors on every wall and the ceiling in your fuckcave to watch yourself fucking? Ima get a translucent sexrobot so I can see my own cock. I'm using the high testosterone excuse; good thing the old brain is stronger than the silly blood chemicals. Groucho Marx said, "I'd never be a member of a country club that would have me as a member." Chokers are from ancient people, though they may have been into sex; we really shouldn't assume they were. Brava.
Don't we all bleed..... don't we all?
I am a cis woman that constantly sleeps with a bra because it helps with my anxiety
*Peter Coffin!!!!* 😀✊
26:25-27:13 So a typical female sexual experience is not needing to come? I'm confused. I'm a cis woman and I need orgasms on a regular basis. It's likely that the average man reacts more strongly to visual cues than I do, but I also enjoy looking at naked men (though I'll admit I'm not into the beefcakes in magazines, preferring the slender geeks). I don't know if this is normal or not. I don't wear my bra to bed, but I know others who do, and I happily wear one in the day.
thank you
This is fascinating and the presenter is compelling, however, one thing remarkably missing... sex = procreation. As women, this factor since the beginning of time is a forefront issue of living as a woman, until the modern age with more successful methods of birth control. (I'm excluding a priestly class that castrated themselves, and lived as priestesses for particular goddess cults.) Therefore, the fundamental removal of this exclusively female factor makes me wonder about the premise on both yours and Blanchard's/Bailey theory.   Isn't Ai just on the horizon then. I would love to see more content from you. Someone needs to figure this out for the rest of us.
So where do trans guys fit in to this....oh I forgot we are not real...
I love this video so much. To confirm, as a cis woman I am 100% turned on by my own vagina and tiddies. Granted I’m bisexual so I’m turned on by all sexes and genders which might play a part in it, but acting like there’s merit to the concept of autogynophilia in trans people and not cis people is ridiculous. Also not using cis women as a control group completely discredits any scientific argument, it’s just basic scientific practice?? There’s really no way of looking at it other than pure transphobia in my opinion.
The fucksaw thing is fucked haha
mmmmmmmmmmm ofc dogs go to heaven wtf
dont google the fucksaw event tbh
Someone probably already left this comment and you’re probably already aware, but I haven’t seen addressed much the fact that Blanchard has unfortunately extended his theory to include trans men, who are either the tru-trans type (super-butch super-lesbians from childhood) or the fake-trans “autoandrophiles” (straight women LARPing as gay men, tied into the “ROGD” theory—young, naive, impressionable, confused, mentally ill girls spend too much time on Tumblr, become so obsessed with gay men they decide to “appropriate” their identities). If you claim to be an asexual trans man, you’re also secretly autoandrophilic. The conversations I’ve had with those who ascribe to these beliefs always end in them accusing me of lying about/misrepresenting my own experiences. Great stuff.  Love this video.
8:36 I almost fell out of my chair laughing.  That's probably the funniest response to someone I'll hear all week.
Bailey probably wants to be hate-fucked exclusively, since he's so smart, and he knows everyone will take on the emotion to hate his stupid guts until they just can't help from inhaling the jiggle rum out of him. Nice try, Bailey: Nobody likes anything like that.
I don't care if you built a sex robot. Don't tell me how to live my life.
What actual scientific evidence is there that trans women are actually "female souls trapped in male bodies"? Isn't it just a personality disorder?
Ok but your background music fucking slaps
I'm a cis lesbian and I've encountered a lot of these kinds of arguments on lesbian forums (*cough* reddit) by women who are attracted other cis women but not to trans women.   I've always been curious what it really means to feel trans or be trans, and all I've ever encountered have been the fluffy arguments about being a woman trapped in a woman's body, or something else that made it seem like trans women were simplifying the definition of being a woman (particularly with regard to social roles and aesthetic expression) and then saying that that's what they wanted. That felt a little condescending, and the argument that we should be trying to expand the defiinition of womanhood and not make the category more narrow made sense to me as well. Gender dysphoria as a concept of basically hating one's body for its secondary sexual characteristics and wanting to have opposite secondary sex characteristics, or even a mixture of male and female secondary sex characteristics made sense to me, as well. So I never agreed with the notion that trans women aren't women, or that their experiences are somehow fake. The idea that a trans woman just "feels like a woman" never did, because as you say, we cis people don't "feel" like our own genders. We just feel like ourselves and that can mean a lot of things.   But your incredibly raw and descriptive explanation of how you felt about treating and being treated (sexually, interpersonally, walking down the street) as a woman and your experiences growing up really resonated with me a lot. Especially with regards to being a woman attracted to women. When I was a teenager a lot of my sexual experiences were with feminine teenaged boys, and that largely satisfied what is my sexual attraction for women. As I got older, the boys started looking and feeling so much more like *men* and that repulsed me. There also seemed to be fewer boys interested in being *treated* as women. And so I came out as a lesbian because largely, being treated and a woman and treating my partner as a woman could only really be fulfilled by women -- considering secondary sexual characteristics and interpersonal demeanor. And if those are the things that feel unfulfilled by a pre-transitioned trans person, I can relate to that a lot because it seems like a more honest depiction of what it actually means to be a woman. It's still kind of fluffy and ineffable, but so are a lot of things.
Wow! A trendy, trans-YouTuber just debunked a scientist in his own field of expertise. Not really...
Spirited and emotional but glibly oversimplifies Blanchard's scientific transsexual typology view in favor of her subjective feelings  (her perspective) about it. This gal even admits that gender dysphoria was what led her to transition which is essentially a mental disorder.  According to Blanchard,  he concedes that the only reason they changed the term from "gender-identity disorder" to "gender dysphoria" was an attempt to " make patients and also trans activists and transsexual-activist groups feel happy or that they had been listened to".  Nearly every utterance she makes when you dissect it is either fallacious or just incredulous.
I've never felt like I'm a man. like the person I am is 'male' enough to be what I am. coming to terms with my gay-ness (or whatever) I still have these thoughts. what's the point? why do I feel such an attachment to being male and liking men? I don't know! I don't want to know or care. I just want to be.
I don't know why I put off watching this. probably the title made me feel uncomfortable. you are my new spirit mom. my proverbial mentor. thank you for being you.
honestly this video vibes with my whole being so. much. more. when I'm hopelessly drunk.
What's that opera music in the beginning?
Chicago: Home of the Fucksaw Incident
Just googled the fucksaw incident. What the actual fuck(saw)? Just sold y'all don't have to Google it, what he basically did was have a couple have sex using a fucksaw (a modified saw that uses a dildo instead of a blade) infront of his class.
It’s good to see you singing again love :)
Just want to say that I think what you are doing is absolutely amazing. x
Got to disagree with the statement that women don’t get turned on by the thought of being women. Definitely had that experience in early puberty. I think all of the behaviors that Bailey uses to try and stigmatize transwomen can be very natural parts of cis female sexuality, and I (though I consider myself NB not cis) certainly have experienced many of them in my lifetime. Sexuality is complicated, and never wrong as long as consent is emphasized!  P.s. Also totes wear fishnets and corsets, though I am a kinkster so maybe it doesn’t count...
45:48 I want to thank you speak up for the community. Much love <3.
Some cis women do sleep with bras, for support.
I thought I was well educated about the effects of HRTs but I had no idea it changed your sex drive so fundamentally. Hearing you talk about your sex drive as a female was something I identified with (which allowed for some personal introspection), while your description of your sex drive as a male was completely foreign to me. It is fascinating how much is truly controlled by hormones, and how changeable--naturally or purposefully--the human body and mind can be even into adulthood. I really enjoyed this video because I learned about things I hadn't ever considered before, so thanks for that! Also I wear my bra while sleeping as a cis woman >.< I just find it comfortable somehow lmao
TFW > The guy who basically wrote the DSM V entry on gender dysphoria debunked this video a few days ago on Twitter.  "YouTube intellectual" vs. PHD scientist who has spent his entire life studying sexual identity disorders.
I want her to expand to more than trans issues, she is too funny!
Cis woman who wears these basically training bra things to bed because my boobs are big enough to need a bit support even at night. As cliche as this phrase is, you are valid! Entirely 100 percent valid exactly as you are. I love you exactly as you are and exactly as you wish to be. You are a woman and I love that woman.
Brilliant, concise, and so brave of you.So well researched, "no stone left unturned"! Subscribing to your channel is the best thing I've done in a long time on YouTube. And you are gorgeous!
If you are on the receiving end of one commentary theme, it's this: you are spot on right, and that's from a cis man who read Bailey's shithouse trash novel the day it was released. Shortly after it was released, i also happened to start following the life of one young 4 year old who was becoming aware that she is the same gender as her mother, and a problem arose in that she had the same body as her father. It seems that everyone's discussion misses entirely the point that transition has less to do with "self" and more to do with "the relating to others". Let's break it down with a few names that you yourself clearly know:  You: Group C. related incongruently at a young age with others around you, so you transitioned in order to make that relation congruent. Lynn Conway: Group C. related incongruently at a young age with others around you, so you transitioned in order to make that relation congruent.  Jazzy Jennings: Group C. related incongruently at a young age with others around you, so you transitioned in order to make that relation congruent. Kelly Lepley: Group C. related incongruently at a young age with others around you, so you transitioned in order to make that relation congruent.  Donna Rice: Group C. related incongruently at a young age with others around you, so you transitioned in order to make that relation congruent.  Mark Cummings: Group C. related incongruently at a young age with others around you, so you transitioned in order to make that relation congruent.  He is a special case because he attempted to revert in order to prove Bailey's theories to be true, and he failed. Not on one, but on 4 separate occasions that I am aware of. Perhaps this conversation needs the input of a person who is cis for the simple reason that I relate to other males as being the same gender that I am, and I relate to you as being someone who is not the same person as I am. It's pretty simple, yet so hard to get anyone to listen to. It appears common sense is not welcome in this conversation, and we as a human species need to skew it in order to paint targets on victims. Sadly the Bailey/Blanchard camp is growing their followers, with Dreger apologetics seeming to lead the growth spurt. Can i say spurt on youtube?
I am an autogyniphile. Thank you for this video. You knocked this issue out the f*****g park. I'm working with my therapist to determine if transitioning is right for me. But women like you make me proud of my femininity. If I do become a woman it's not because I'm so pretty I'd f**k myself. It's because I adore and worship everything that is womyn And your video reminded me I'm not the only penis owner that feels this way. Thank you so much. Your wonderful. 💕
Having BDSM clothing for Rocky Horrer *is* gay culture
I don't know why ContraPoints appeared in my reccommended videos a week ago but I'm happy it did 👍
OK, I'm a boring dumpy middle-aged cis-woman happily long-term hooked up with a man, and I freely admit to an element of what this Blanchard turkey would call autogynephilia.  Doesn't nearly everybody on Earth enjoy tits on some level?
Your description of your childhood sounds a lot like mine. Although I'm now in my 30s and have still never had sex nor do I have any desire to do so. But when I have fantasized, it has been much like what you described. It was more like fantasizing about being in a relationship, something I've also never actually experienced. But back to childhood, I was also bad at sports, I don't think I was particularly masculine or feminine (although there is a picture of me aged around 5 wearing flowers in my hair and looking like a drunk women at a horse race) and my main interest was music (something else that hasn't changed). I never really went for the androgynous look though, well maybe for a few months after I discovered David Bowie, but then I went full on hippy. Because my stage name is Prime8, I wanted to try and look as much like a gorilla as I could. Subconsciously, I think I was hiding. The beard was a big hairy mask lol.
This video is too good. I've watched it multiple times. It's just. So. Good.
I’m sorry you had to make this. I’m thankful you did. You’re beautiful :)
Oh MY god the f*cksaw 😂😂
I don't turn myself on when I present as a woman but I get....Excited? Excited that I'm making progress and look sexier in the ways that I want to be. Is that autogynephilia?
For those curious to read about Bailey's fuck saw. I had a good giggle. https://jezebel.com/northwestern-professor-shows-class-a-live-orgasm-demo-5775675
It's cool to see her so raw and real. Seeing her break character a few times was kinda funny as well.
Was... The patient number a reference to Alex DeLarge in a Clockwork Orange? Because bravo
Are you patient #655321 because #654321 was too obvious.
Occams razor surely forbids the creation of new sexual orientations to save a failed hypothesis.
whats weird about the whole fifty shades style erotica stereotype is the whole 'guy discards all other choices in favour of you, is totally obsessed, follows you and stalks you and controls you financially" whereas like, yeah its nice to be singled out by a really impressive or attractive person, but to me the rest is just completely impossible to imagine as sexy or desirable. when I was a teenager I was completely won over by that stuff, I'm not sure why; maybe because I had a lot of crushes on one of my teachers and on many older celebrities at the time and craved that fantasy in edward cullen/christian gray types, even if the stories were very toxic in nature. In my late teens and now early twenties I'm more interested in the inaccessibility of more impressive or attractive people, I'm very put off by guys who get infatuated and obsessive without getting to know you very well. I can't remember how he was in the books but the character Four/Tobias in the Divergent film series is actually a good example of a good balance between the edward cullen type (brooding, loner, but choses the very average protag as his love interest) and more asshole-ish characters (he is kind of a dick to her at first but takes the time to actually get to know her, he shares his secrets with her but lets her have her own personality). I think when you're younger you want a sudden whirlwind romance, as you get a bit older you hopefully realise that if someone is careful about not jumping to conclusions about their feelings to fast and interested in you as a person, their feelings are more likely to be genuine and lead to something enjoyable.
I really appreciate you making all this content. I previously had no way to understand transgender perspectives other than, "well ok people want to live that way, it's not much place to judge."   I have trans friends but haven't had conversations about so much of this. I really enjoy getting a glimpse of other people's perspective and I really can't express adequately how much I appreciate your content
Great video and maybe I'm a weird cis woman but I prefer to sleep with a bra and only stopped because I read its so bad for you. I guess it might be because I have huge boobs, it's just nice to keep them in place when I'm trying to sleep, just more comfortable.
But I do like the smell of my own body odor!!
I think this a great work. Thank you.
I’m not wealthy enough to pour that much baileys into a glass /:
I find it hard to comprehend that we are essentially the same age; your intelligence is far superior to mine. My education is restricted to some of highschool, the U.S. ARMY, and the life of hard knocks as a heroin addict (after being medically discharged), ultimately ending up as a paraplegic. I've been through some SHIT, but I envy your education, effectiveness, talent, humor, insight, ambition, etc, and I feel inadequate in my own skin. I've always just wanted to help people, and I hope (even without a proper education) that someday I can create a similar platform to yours and do just that. Keep it up. I'm a proud contributor to your work. You opened my eyes.
How can anyone defend Bailey? I mean, it's totally fine to be kinky- that's not my point. How does one defend Bailey's positions? Especially when it's so blatantly obvious that he's not coming at this from a scientific standpoint (Perhaps there's science, but it's  fatally flawed and biased). I mean, I wanna see someone get drilled on stage, too! But, come on... And the commenting on porn from detractors, the way he describes his encounters with trans-women (since he basically neglects trans-men and non-binary) and declaring who's "better looking?" How is that "science?" He's just jerking off and cumming on everything and everyone. He's not the fucking final authority on these issues... come on, people.  PS: "I was born a fucking baby."
I am a cis women, and I do dress that way sometimes XD
You admit there are actual autogynephiliacs (sp?) but DENY their representativeness, of the trans community, while holding up Anthony Wiener (Carlos Danger) as being entirely representative of heterosexual men? HA.  It is to laugh.
If that's your thing, work. I'm just always confused by the first minute  in your video's.
Bachhhhh
Denial of autogynophilia is one of the hallmarks of this particular sexual fetish.
Cards on the table, I’m a boy (XY). I most closely associate with autogynephilia. I haven’t had any medical procedures or diagnoses. I don’t think it’s the best description, but for me, Blanchard is closer to the truth than Trans Activists.  We’re both subject to our presuppositions, and considering how pervasive the “Trans Activist” view is, it’s no surprise that most trans-women will accept it.  I’d love to hear a criticism of Blanchard’s theory that doesn’t rely on post-modernism or other anecdotes.
It's kinda wild to listen to a video like this and suddenly hear my doctor's name (Dr. Charles Moser, a wonderful man!) mentioned for one of their (pro-trans) studies!
The way you play the piano just LOOKS super womanly. the way you carry yourself and play just does and it's great. Any hater who says otherwise is just lying to themselves. Fantastic video to boot, way more polite than those asshats deserve
I am so infinitely grateful that you have the strenght and took the effort to make this video, and respect you so much regardless.  it gives me such hope and brings me such joy, as a trans person to see you engage in debated that might seem only intellectual to cis people, but im fact require us to subject ourselves to such scrutiny by the ones listening and often already rejecting us from the start. as a teacher I hope I may reach your level of specificity and philosophical insight.
The fact that you can make a video on a topic as difficult and frustrating as this and remain so eloquent and genuinely funny is amazing. You're awesome.
I'll probably be ripped apart for this, but what the hell... I actually believe Blanchard's theory has SOME validity. I think he had it wrong when he decided that all transwomen are either effeminate gay men pressured into being women or perverted straight men who get off on the idea of being women. The former just sounds too ridiculous and probably never happens, however, as for the latter... Let me just say that I genuinely believe there legitimate transpeople afflicted with dysphoria who really do feel like they are trapped in the wrong body. But I also feel there are some people who are perverted, vapid attention whores who get on essentially LARPing as women and doing it only for the SJW power trip and/or some bizarre kink/sexual fantasy.
This video was incredibly uncomfortable at points for a cis, white, straight male. I can't even imagine being brave enough to put this together yourself. Christ. You got balls lady. Metaphorically, and otherwise.
I want to make a comment, but no matter what direction I go, I wind up revealing way too much of my own sexuality, and my mother has access to the internet, so I'll have to save that for the anonymous stuff...
Natalie please take this heart of mine 💛
The greatest trans philosopher of our time
Wait, so he went to gay bars and porn sites, interviewed trans women and somehow came to the conclusion that all trans women are highly sexually active people? Why not interview trans women who like to sit at home with their cats?
You are not a woman and never will be.
I love when you perform at the end.
This analysis is just as biased (hello, Contra classic AGP-denying autogynephile) as it claims Bailey's original research and conclusions to be...
I love your stance on the feminine essence theory. I've just had a lecture on sexual determination and differentiation and its amazing how truly fluid biological sex can be during embryonic and childhood development. Although i totally agree that some people can feel like they were born in the wrong body, i found it really enlightening that you present an alternative concept on the subject.
Eyyy sleeping in bras must be in the overlap of the venn diagram between trans women and trans men! I sleep in a sports bra or two because I can't stand them just. Flopping around. Can't do it. Damn I wish I could donate my tits to a trans sister
7:27 way off topic but as a young brown woman can I just say how much I FUCKING HATE the word exotic being used to describe human beings??? It makes us sounds like some sort of colorful tropical bird that Darwin wants to cage and take back to the *CiViLiZeD wOrLd.* Like dude, if you're gonna imply that we're foreign and animalistic, don't dance around it with pretty euphemisms. Exotic is a word white men use as shorthand for "She doesn't look like a white woman and yet (gasp!) She is still somehow... Attractive?????" And I just really hate it.
*grabs a beer and laughs it up*
And I had always thought that Blanchard's was the standard theory for transgenderism. Thanks for clarifying it for the insulting nonsense it is.
Guys, seriously look up the Fucksaw Incident. It's freaky
As a white, heterosexual, cisgender man (had to look up the terminology). I sincerely appreciate your candor and your willingness to make yourself vulnerable on such a public forum. Not just "trans women and TERFs" care. I can't claim I always "get it" but I'm more than happy to listen. keep up the good work.
So, what's it like to be an actual genius?
Hey, from a young girl to a woman; you look super pretty in this video and I hope I grow up to be half as pretty as you!
How am I just figuring out you exist? I absolutely LOVE you!
F U C K S A W
i think the goddamn fucksaw incident should immediately discredit everything this motherfucker says, holy shit
T R A N S   A C T I V I S T S
Nani the fuck?
I love that you adress these things and how you do.
I love you
I sleep in a soft sleep bra because my boobs are pretty sensitive and I need the support, if you go on amazon and look for comfort bras you will find taht a lot of women wear bras full time for support, so thats not a thing you do and other women do not, some women do.
But... I *am* autogynephilic
wow, that video was so touching in so many layers. thanks for the boldness and knowledge that you bring to it.
How is whatever Blanchard is doing science? How is he a scientist?
Thank you for sharing your deeply personal internal processing of your transition. I'm sure I'm not alone in being an ally yet also morbidly curious about the things we definitely should not ask or expect our trans friends to share. I know it is only yours and you are very specifically not claiming it is universal, but getting a glimpse into your experience definitely satisfied that curiosity for me.
I can see how much of this would be terrifying to share, but I want to thank you for sharing it. And actually, traversing the exhausting, if not exhaustive, history of yourself in terms of gender, sexuality and sex has implanted your being a woman more deeply, significantly and naturally in my idea of you as a person than I previously perceived. (I think that last sentence makes more metaphysical and epistemological implications I wouldn't hold to, but I'm not sure how else to phrase it. Maybe: I think of you even more as a woman after learning all that.) Your thoughts and stories are very helpful to me and I will have to keep up on what else you have to say about gender.
11:26 Excuse me can we not throw Beelzebub under the bus with those two #notalldemons
rocky horror? my family literally choreographed to time warp.
This was like watching doctor manhatten sacrifices his social credit for the good of humanity, bearing the burden others cannot
You are fierce and fearless. Proud of you, let your light shine!
"I find out later that she is from Belize"This yeeted my sides into orbit.
Was I the only one who actually stopped the video to google “the fuck saw incident?”
Natalie, you're so lovely, intelligent, incredibly brave, and an excellent speaker. <3  Thank you!
I may actually want to see your sex robot .........
Actually, my mom wears a bra to bed (yes, she's cis), and so did my grandma. So it's not THAT unusual.
I really like your singing voice
You can actually say Bach XD
Is it normal to rewatch ContraPoints videos several times?
I just want to say how brave you are and that making this video must have been really tough! Good job girl. Love your videos
I really want to show this to my boyfriend just for the understanding of what hormones do and how to turn on a women on.
Be my friend! : ooo
this theory are not false.Guy who invented that theory is absolutly right, but it is not necessary stright dudes like themselvs and they jerking off on reflection in the mirror maybe someone duing that kind of things  but not all. it just one of the sexual perversions like BDSM or urination. and guys who like thinking about themselves as a girl  even dont wear women clothes or something like that. me for example: i like lesbians and when i see how they kissing each other or having sex, i like thinkining that i'm one of this girls and this is really torns me on but after it my thoughts like "omg girls so beatifull i wish to be like them " just gone and a became a normal cisgender male. maybe some of them even change theire gender and make transition but again not all. and some people like the dude on this channel like to be a girl 24/7 and many transgenders are really became womens(if we can call that people women) becouse they enjoying womens body or even role of women in our society, sometimes even i think about that "womens are beatifull i think it is fun to be a girl wearing dress with long hair" but i;m not ready cut my dick dring hormons and live as women for the rest of my life. but some people do that and its ok but not call youreself woman guys we all know that you born as boy and for now atlest you cant did nothing wit it. maybe taht wizzard scientists make technology that can transplontate our min in other body and then all people can be whatevere they like.
Good video. You're one of the most intelligent Youtubers out there.
I've learned more from you in two days than I have in 60 years of life.
You are genuinely one of the most fascinating women I've ever encountered. Intelligent, sensible, witty, funny, alluring and engaging. Consider me a definite fan!
Sorry, long, rambly, really personal comment incoming, but... Omg, thank you so much for the part about women's attraction to men! Because I identify so strongly with it, but it's something I've struggled to understand about myself and felt bad about. I've never felt that a guy was "hot" and therefore I was attracted to them. It's way more about the way someone acts (and also my mood) that influences wether I feel attraction. But I didn't really understand that so I felt really bad that I couldn't truthfully tell my boyfriend I found him "hot" in that way. This gives me such a new perspective and maybe a new way of explaining to him how I'm attracted to him and why his looks don't really relate to that. (Although he is quite handsome, and I appreciate that in other contexts) Okay, I'm done rambling about myself now...
Why are people involved in philosophy and psychology so obsessed with the word "pathology"?
I just saw Handel's Semele in concert, and I was elated to hear the aria from this video!!
Ugh, disgusting  Crimes against nature        Who can drink straight Bailey's? Yuck
"I just want other people to think I'm sexy. It fills up the hole inside" me,  a lesbian dressing up sexy to go to a fraternity party and get flirted with. "Well I can't relate."
I googled "fuck saw incident" and now I can't stop laughing. How ironic that this dude would accuse trans women of being perverts when that's the shit he's into.
Buffalo bill isn't really trans. Therefore he's not a misrepresentation of trans people because he's not, you know, trans. In the book Dr.Lector explains that buffalo bill thinks he wants to be a lady because he's not really excepted. He was also rejected several times when he applied for gender reassignment surgery (wich Is how they find out who he is and arrest them). But I kinda understand your point, most people wouldn't know that because they're fucking stupid and they don't READ THE BOOKS BEFORE THEY WATCH A MOVIE.
You are so damn good lol, initially the only reason I avoided the videos was because they are some quite long ones lol... however, I can not stop watching xD  so hello to my new addiction and some relevant education on my own community lol
Hey, I know it doesn't mean much, but thanks.   As I've described in the comments of another video I have a need for a vagina (not necessarily from birth, but I want to pass on my genes too so long term I guess yah until science fixes that oversight :( )in any sort of non-Platonic relationship and I'm coming to realize how genuinely fucking weird that is.  Still not sure what to call it, autoandrophobia maybe?  Cuz the presence of another penis in the room during sex certainly hurts if not deletes my sex drive...     I'm sure this is due to some underlying failure psychologically... but if theres a term for it please lemme know.  Love learning new things!
On the off chance you read this, Thank You. The way you stood up for the trans community and opened yourself up until you were raw was really powerful. I'm not sure you want an apology for this since it comforts you but I'm sorry you have to sleep in a bra to feel comfortable. I cant stand them on myself at night. I think you're a wonderful and BRILLIANT woman. I really enjoy watching your videos and when I can donate, I do. You're so smart and I'd loved your video on dog whistles (I also love your make up!).
Your mind is incredible.  Also, given the invitation to validate you in this way, I think you are super hot.  ❤️
Yo, this video is about me! I have this! Yoooooo!
I just wanted to say thank you for creating this video and sharing your experiences. I'm in tears because so much of what you've been through resonates with me - Being indifferent to gender when younger, experimenting with crossdressing and feeling like a freak and the cycles of denial and wanting to be "normal", the crushing dread at the through of getting older and dying as a man, relief when your sex drive finally just shuts up for once. The narrative is all too often about how trans people "have known all along", but gender and identity and self-expression and sexuality are so much messier than that. So... thank you again for making me feel a little less alone in this world, and I hope you know you're not alone either.
Natalie Wynn for president!!!
Such a brave, well thought out and presented video. Thank you for making this as now I have a resource I can use when people make similar accusations about me
Such a brave, well thought out and presented video. Thank you for making this as now I have a resource I can use when people make similar accusations about me
I LOVE you
man, i’m really glad i could learn about the fucksaw incident, thanks contrapoints
I absolutely love your channel. Interestingly you're not the first trans person I've seen on video or otherwise listened to, but you're the first to talk at length and in detail about your experience of being trans. Usually upon "meeting" (irl or online) a trans person, my thoughts go "Oh, they're trans" -> initial impression fades -> "that's a man/woman". But in your case, it went "That's a very stylish cis woman interested in LGBT topics" -> "wth she's trans?" -> "she's a trans woman". I don't know how to explain better. Usually the "transness" of the person fades away and becomes background information, but in your case since it's central to your channel it remains something I think about.   Anyway thanks a lot for producing such interesting content!
"This ones on the house kiwifarms. *wink*"              This is what makes Natalie the best. The Teflon skin she dons when dealing with insults and critiscm.
That wanting it be want and it's conflect with the male sex drive maybe the most relatives thing i ever heard. This is a large porblem in my own life do to the melt conflect between the the hormonal drive and emoshial one. My partner is exactly the same only inverted. This leeds to the most disfconchenal romantic life in human history.
Thank you for your labor, I was going to add more labor for you by spewing my own NB gender experience all over the keyboard and then remembered you're a human being and wouldn't want that! Thanks again you're amazing!
Im an Autogynephile. Feels bad man.
ifindoutlaterthatsheisfrombelize
You are so beautiful, Natalie I love your videos
Having only found your channel in the last week I am truly grateful for the insights you share here. Thanks for the clear and concise explanation of why this theory is so irrelevant/abhorrent to trans women.
Natalie is the first YouTuber I can watch for multiple all nighters and not get tired of.
The filth happens at about 18:20. ❤️  Love you Natalie!
You sound very Nina Simone in the ending song, I love it
I know that no one will read my comment but this video is one of the most informative and profound takes on gender and sexuality I’ve ever seen
I LOVE THIS
god I'M in love with you
But does Blanchard ever attempt to address trans women who only date and sleep with other trans women? That seems to throw a wrench in the gears
I actually love when Natalie dresses down in vids. Donna Bella.
Ole uncle Ray's a bit of a twat...
Well. Now I want to see a movie where the male protagonist deals with a powerful female's attraction to them. ... Oh wait, that's the harem anime genre, isn't it?
you are my hero <3
What is the classical song she sings at the beginning?  I've been trying to find it for months now. Help please!
Thank you for your bravery
I love you so much...
Idk why r/gendercritical would be so happy to quote something from a sexist, white male though
I'm a cis women who sleeps in a bra, it's weird/uncomfortable without
tERfS
The Cosmo article does come close, but I still haven't heard of a cis woman who get turned on by just looking at her body, or just having the body she has. Nor have I heard about it from cis men.
I sleep in a bra
I have so much respect for you talking about these issues from your own experience. Listening to them was enlightening and at the same time I was so worried about you opening yourself like that to a community as toxic as the internet especially concerning the topic of transgender. I'd also like to thank you for your view on sexual appealing things from the view of a woman because my girlfriend and I have very different sex-drives which can be a problem because we both struggle to find the right words to express ourselves in this topic. You talking about your experiences as a man AND a woman may have brought a better understand of both her perspective and mine. So a big THANK YOU for that! Please keep going and try to start loving yourself because after seeing this video I cannot think of anyone who deserves it more right now!
One of the things that I do wonder is what if you do have a sexual fetish of imagining yourself as female, but aren't trans? What do we call these people? I know they exist and I don't think it's a bad thing to have this as a fetish in and of itself. It just has noting to do with being transgender, being transgender is of course about dysphoria.
WAit.... I have at least 5 cis lady friends that wear corsets and fishnets off the top of my head and could probably list out a lot more if I actually sat down and tried.  That's definitely a thing cis ladies do.
Thank you for sharing such cleverness, comedy, compassion, and courage. One can forsee these qualities could be beneficial for making a thorough argument. Well done.
I know lots of women who like corsets, but fewer who like fishnet. To be honest, my primary association with fishnet is unisex alt fashion, like punk, hair metal, emo, etc
Thank you for everything -Sam
'Why don't more trans women talk openly about this stuff?'  Because it's none of anyone else's business?  Seriously, anyone who wants someone else to talk openly about really private stuff might want to try it first, and then shut up, because it's still none of your business
25:00 - As far as women touching their own breasts during sex: My girlfriend does that. BUT! she cheats by grabbing MY hands, putting them on her breasts, and then putting her hands on top of my hands that are on top of her breasts, and then squishes and squeezes my hands around lol. So........ I mean..... my hands are basically puppets here. I take over, but her hands stay there either way.  Fuckin' fantastic video.
I’m a bisexual cis woman who is in a relationship with a straight cis man. And he introduced me to your channel. I’ve been bingeing your videos the last few days. You are so well spoken. I’m in love!! Could listen to you talk forever. Keep doing what you’re doing. I’m officially a huge fan💕
It's funny how psychologists who have nothing to do with a trans-woman's situation seem to be "the leading experts" on who they are and how they feel. My nephew said it best. "It would be like me (a young man) talking about how it feels to be pregnant."
Ok, my brain just sploded
You should do a video about the sexuality/gender spectrum, especially asexuality and nonbinary genders, I think you would really do some of the more recent discussions around sexual orientation and gender justice
I’m literally in love with your singing at the end of video. Its kinda like Cher.
I can't believe 'transvestic disorder' and autogynephilia is in the DSM-5. What a load of anachronistic bullshit. Societal stigma and contempt is what causes such psychological manifestations to negatively effect someone, not the manifestations themselves.
Hi hello if it helps at all, i am a cis woman who usually sleeps in my bra (bc im weird in a way that i barely feel a difference and im usually too lazy to take it off and then on again the next morning)
I have to be honest. I'm "cluster A". I've never experienced even a remote attraction to women and my sexuality isn't a sensual, kohl-eyed, soft lens, fantasy dreamscape from an Enigma music video. I like men. I like men's bodies. I like them to be rough with me. To the point where I have to consciously avoid getting into abusive relationships. The thirst is very real and it's powerful. I never considered if that diminished my femininity but... oh yeah... here it comes... the dysphoria... I think I'll just stand in the mirror prodding my face for the next two hours.
Smart lady.
Semele? Do you ever stop being amazing? <3
Deer Lord the Hebrew subs are a clusterfuck. They still refer to you using mixed masculine/feminine morphology rather than purely feminine (which is a must because Semitic languages)—this is the equivalent of consistently referring to you as ‘s.he’. They also use the same awful fucking parsing of the original closed captions. (Seriously, Natalie, you’re amazing as all fuck but the parsing makes it a pain to follow the captions, let alone translate them.) I’ve started undoing some of the damage but boy howdy is that gonna take a while…
Her description of transitioning from male to female sexuality was so validating to my bisexual non-binary ass like....wait....I'm actually both at the same time
My (cis) ex slept with her bra. She had somewhat large breasts, so that could be why, but I can see that argument going the other way.
"No cis woman has ever slept in a bra" This is a joke right
I am a cis woman so correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that a lot of academic transphobia is really just 'i know you better than you do'
Don't break don't break don't break my heart, and I won't break your heart-shaped glaaasses.
Bailey’s... we stan a woman of refined taste
I'll fuck you ;)
44:32 Actually it’s pretty common for cis women to sleep in bras contra! I personally don’t but I have many friends who do generally because they like the coverage or they don’t want their boobs flopping about. So yeah don’t worry about that one
We are tied to these temporal bodies and we are tied to this planet and maintain these forms due to the earth’s magnetosphere.  Great video!
Am I the only one who got the Ace Attorney reference or did I read into it too much?
Oh my god ?! You went to Northwestern?? I’m a northwestern student right now !! You’ve suddenly become my favorite YouTube personality
The only thing I'd like add/suggest/whatever is that the argument shouldn't be the existence of auto[gyne/andro]philia but rather the distinction between said paraphilias and what can be best described as gender dysphoria, or at least, said distinction should be thoroughly addressed as both seem to exist somewhat separately. That's the best way I can word it.
Outdated, unimportant comment but there are many cis women who sleep in bras. They usually start as preteens feeling uncomfortable in a changing body and eventually age out of it. Some adult women continue but they're usually doing it in an ineffective attempt to prevent sagging boobs
Not going to lie, I work in a crematory and listened to this while I was grocery shopping and have to admit that I was wondering if I was being "clocked" since I was buying my work lunches just after work. Living trans isn't the same as burning bodies, but sometimes we have startlingly similar anxiety.
Lindsay Ellis clued me in on your YouTube channel.  I am 70 years old and have been a cross-dresser since I was about 10 years old.  Not only did I give you a "Thumbs Up" on the little button thing. I was giving you literal "thumbs up" while I was watching your video. So many things you say match my personal experience.  I once read an article from a transwoman who said that she was fetishist about women's clothing for about three years.  She eventually got to a place where it was, "Ok, these are my clothing that I wear all the time. Now how do I get to be a better person?" I've heard similar comments from cisgenger women who spend about three years dolling up, and then eventually get tired of it. It's a lot of work.  It's not that they never like dressing up again. It's just that they want to focus more energy on more useful projects. And then there's Dolly Parton! She is always dressed "in character" as Dolly Parton!  When she was in the show "Nine to Five" the other actresses would be "in drab" when not on set.  But not Dolly Parton. She was always "in drag" as Dolly Parton!  Sweet Dolly Parton! When I was in my 20's, I got married and worked as an insurance executive. There was pressure to be young, dynamic & decisive!  I wore The Power Suit, with The Power Shirt and The Power Tie and Power Shoes and carry the Power Brief Case! That was a kind of "transvestism" for me too. I was dressing up in a costume to be someone I truly wasn't.  But it was socially acceptable. And I was rewarded rather well for it.  MY ex-wife hated me for being a trans-person. So much for White Male Privilege!
Booooooring
Honestly? Bailey is just writing transgender fanfic
my grandmother cannot sleep without a bra, and she's a cis woman. so....you're not alone :)
I spent too much time in the shower because I was beating my meat turned out it was OCD the entire time
Can... can you win awards for sarcastic readings of a transphobe’s writings?  Because whoever did the reading for the Man Who Would Be Queen definitely deserves a nom.
14:06 hothothothot hotthothot
I'm someone who has no interest in relationships, but I do have casual sex. What I find most interesting about my situation is that I still want to be wanted, but I don't want anyone to tell me because the verbal confirmation makes me uncomfortable. I totally understand the feeling of needing something on my chest. It's always when I'm trying to fall asleep my chest just craves it, it's really weird. Like I need a bunch of rocks stacked on top of me. Like I physically need it. Why?
During the trial scene when you mention you do things cis women don't do, and cite wearing a bra to sleep: You may be intrigued to learn that in fact, there are many women who do wear bras to sleep.  I know that's contrary to the trope of a girl getting home from work and the first thing she does is unleash the gals to get comfortable, but they do exist! Many women who are, shall we say, particularly busty, will sleep in bras because it can be uncomfortable to have them flop around or fall into your armpits or squish together awkwardly when you lie on your side.  You can confirm I speak the truth by lurking in communities, subreddits, or forums devoted to finding bras/clothing that fit and don't look weird when you have disproportionately large breasts (shoutout to r/ABraThatFits !)   And yeah, perhaps ironically, their reason for sleeping in a bra is the opposite of yours (desiring not to feel so much weight from the unwieldy flesh bags), but the *goal* of a sleep bra is the same regardless: to feel comfortable and secure enough to sleep :)  I know this is an oddly specific, minor point to dwell on so long after the video was released, but when you delivered that line it seemed like it was coming from a place of sadness or remorse, maybe wistfulness, or at the very least feeling like you need to defend actions like that, and it really struck me hard. For anyone out there who might feel odd about doing that sort of stuff: it's not at all weird, outside of, or separate from "authentic" womanhood, whatever that may mean.  People are bizarre and idiosyncratic and do all kinds of little atypical things for all sorts of reasons and no one should ever feel unrelateable or inauthentic for adopting a harmless mannerism or habit that allows them to connect or identify with themselves more profoundly, is all.
This is a stupid comment but I just want to say I live in Chicago and my mom went to the same college as you. I originally didn't want to go to that school for those reasons but seeing how you turned out makes me kind of reconsider.
the casualness of 22:04 killed me, nearly choked on my dinner
Thank you for doing this
Thank you for sharing.  Thank you for your service.
For people who really love to push the "2 genders, your gender is determined by chromosomes and hormones" narrative, they sure love to ignore the huge impact that hormones actually have on human bodies.
It seems Blanchard is looking at data and trends and interpreting them through the broken lens or his own sexuality.
I wonder if the character of Mason Verger in "Hannibal" was written as an apology for the Buffalo Bill character and the uproar and pain it caused with the publication of "Silence of the Lambs."
I've watched this video several times and I only just now noticed the patient number 655321 Well done, Natalie. Nice touch
I'm cis and I sleep in my bra. I always have. Ever since I was a teen. Dunno why.
And I an open minded (not open legged lol, more like a lady on the streets but a freak in the sheets, with the right guy of course, and I am very picky too but anyhoot!) I am curious to learn about all different topics, I love to read books, I love nature, animals, science, art ect ect ect. Also I don't give a flying f*ck about what anyone is, gay lesbian, bi, trans, whatever. As long as you are honest about who you are we will probably get along just fine! (Unless of course you're some kind of religious nut and only want to tell me that I am going to hell simply because I do not believe in your god, then we are done!) Anyhoot again, I never even heard of the word Autogynephilia before so of course I had to watch, but sorry Natalie, as soon as you mentioned the fucksaw thing, then said to go look it up, I didn't actually register another word after that! I will try to re watch this video after I learn more about that insanity but for now I am leaving this comment, and wish you all well!! Love to all my gay boyfriends out there! -CC! P.S. and trans-women like NW too, honestly I rather be friends with both trans women (pre bottom op that is) and gay dudes simply because I've dealt with other straight females who I thought were my friend but they just went after my BF, so it's easier to just keep straight male friends, gay male friends, and trans-women friends, cuz they won't f*ck my BF (behind my back or out in the open) anf if for some strange reason they do end up in bed with a guy I thought was my bf, then the two of them can go be together far far away from me! LOL!
Fuckin... _Zounds!_ You make a stellar case in general, but the point at 32:26 was just so well made.
The fuck saw thing is wack. You really should look it up
why cher tho?
[Throwaway account because I'm a coward]  I am a straight cis male, and imagining myself as a woman is one of the things that get me off. I don't dress up in female clothes, I have never considered taking hormones, I am comfortable in my own body. But the fantasy of just magically being a woman is very arousing to me. So I guess that makes me paraphilic, and that's ok. I also like to consume written pornography, as opposed to visuals, for what it's worth.  Thank you for all the insight and for the amazing video!
I want my goddmn filth!!!.... wait are you saying dogs don't go to heaven? well why the hell would anyone go there then, what a rip off...  as in the 'The Brothers Karamazov' one would return their ticket to heaven
I think it's just that Baily (I'll never forget that f*cksaw) has reported feelings for one, but also has to make it seem disgusting or bad in some way. It's annoying. I'm annoyed on your behalf. Just ... Screw him!  **Edit** "Or maybe I'm just a woman who wants someone to fuck me once in a while" lmao I'm so damn glad I found this channel!
Hey uh, I sleep with a bra on.
I respect you so much for making this
Seriously, look up the fucksaw incident. It’s fucking hard to believe that happened
I love how, since her transition, Natalie just seems more confident and strong to me.  It's like I can feel a small sense of just how much more she belongs this way. :)
This channel has been very eye opening and educational for me. Thank you for sharing the most intimiate and vulnerable aspects of yourself in your videos, i think your doing great work in educating the public.  I don't know how to not sound like an asshole considering you said how terrible it was for you to share this stuff and why it's terrible and i am indeed a CIS woman I'm pretty sure who is congratulating you. I guess im not trying to be insensitive i just really am grateful for you opening my eyes and helping me understand.
When I thought I couldn't admire you more I stumble unto this masterpiece where you put yourself in harms way in order to debunk those hacks and on top of that you reference Red Letter Media, You truly are a Goddess.
Peter's reading of Blanchard/Bailey @ 7:19 is the funniest shit I've ever heard. "AS A RESEARCHER" lol i can't
I can totally resonate with your point of platonic love in the beginning.
I cried at the trial scene. Great video.
Just watched a 3 hour long radfem panel and I needed to cleanse my palette.
can you do a full dramatic reading of the man who would be queen?
the one size too big sexy cop costume is killing me
I relate as a trans man. Like the exact mirror.
This channel is destroying my mind
I honestly can't tell if the section on cis female sexuality is a joke or not. I'm often confused and irritated by sex researchers' characterizing my sexuality as primarily relational. Stories about Christian Grey's high class furniture can be great and all, but actually I'd rather hear about his cock. Idk if I'm actually an outlier or not. I suppose the answer is that female sexuality of any kind hasn't been studied properly.
Sometimes it seems like these bizarrely sensationalist scientists just haven't seen enough porn.
Thank you for this video. I read J. Michael Bailey’s book while in undergrad at NU. The book was controversial back in 2004 and I am glad to hear and echo your opinions. Thanks. Go ‘cats. Love your videos.
I hope you find someone who loves you for what you are, not "as a woman" @Contrapoints. As a white male i seek an alliance with the homosexual and trans people against the femminists. As an individual i don't want to be discriminated for things other man do or did, i hope humanity will achieve unity and equality instead of trying to fuck each other all the time ^^
You are definitely not alone in sleeping in a bra. I’d just strongly recommend keeping it loose and taking out any bones and/or underwire so you don’t get hurt. That’s not a fun lesson to learn the hard way 😅
I’m a cis woman who always sleeps in a bra. It’s partly because my nips are pretty sensitive, and partly because I have an irrational fear of some unexpected disaster occurring, like a fire, where I won’t have time to adequately clothe myself. And I’m sure there are more pseudo-never-nudes like us out there, Natalie.
i'm a trans man. even when i thought i was a cis woman, i would wear a bra to bed. not because of any binding power or anything, but because i have big boobs and it's genuinely uncomfortable to ever not have something on my chest holding the monsters of mass dysphoria in place.
maybe female sexuality is different form male sexuality because of socialization? maybe? just a thought
I've watched this twice and even though I know she sings the song at the end to be silly, I cried like a damn baby both times.
Impressed by your wits and honesty!
Thank you for posting this. I have a couple of friends transitioning, one whom I've known for years who has recently started, the other I met a year after they started the process. I do my damndest to be an ally, but sometimes, there are questions I want to ask, but know that even opening my mouth on the subject is a mistake, and extremely rude.   Became a fan of yours after seeing you pop up in the recommends section after watching far too much H. Bomberguy and Thought Slime, and I have enjoyed all the videos I've had the time to watch so far - self employed, owning a comic book store gives me plenty of time for that - and I think you're making me a better person.   I was a left wing, socialist, skeptical rationalist before then, and I still am, but I think I'm better at understanding other points when it's expected, and considerably better at arguing when that is what is required.   TL;DR, keep it right the fuck up!
Trans men seem to always be absent from these types of “studies.”  I wonder why that is?
I’m drunk so I can’t think of anything articulate to say, so I’m just going to say that you are so hot and soooo frickin smart and so witty. You’re the best and I love you!
“a straight dude that realizes 20yo straight women are more attractive than 40yo lesbians and trying to pass it off as science” 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
this video made me so aware of my own sexuality; of what roles i take on during sex as a cis woman, albeit my sexual experiences have been with other women; and of how female sexuality is painted in further society. i wasn't aware of how little i focused on personal sexuality and how sexual experiences by women are shaped because of how much attention i paid to the overall sexualization of women in modern media. natalie, u did that bitch
has nothing at all to do with this video other than u mentioned it, but bailey's creme is fucking banger and when i wanna have a good time i put that shit in some chocolate milk and go both crazy and stupid
I'd fuck me. Literally, if there was a star trek style transporter accident my first instinct would be to retire to my/our quarters and fuck my brains out. Yet I have no desire to transition into a woman. Would be interesting to see what that "scientist" would say about that one.
Im a cis woman who sleeps in her bra for exactly the same reason as you Contra, you are not alone in this I promise lol
Cher is just a kinky legend. That doesn't make all trans lesbians who transitioned later in life deviants or liars. Jesus H Macy.
SOOOOO GOOOD!!!!
I love that your patient number is 655321. It makes me happy.
I have so many thoughts on this subject. I can tell you that yes I am turned on by being a woman. Though I was born a woman. I think you’re a beautiful woman and you are doing such an amazing job with your channel. 💋
"I wasn't born a woman, I was born a fucking baby" 🤣🤣
Al Gator is adorable. Also, your analysis is so thorough. What makes it even more brilliant is that unlike the Blanchards of this world, you cant pretend to be rigourous and make claims to science. You have to BE rigourous AND make yourself so vulnerable in order to be taken seriously by a lot of people. Much admiration.
I just want to give you the biggest hug.
To any lesbian trans sisters who might be watching, Blanchard and Bailey really are creepy hacks. This shit led me to a decade of confusion, depression, and self-loathing. You are valid, and don't take any shit from any mental health professionals or docs who buy into this fuckery
Also dang the lighting in this video makes me really appreciate your cheekbones. DANNNGGGGG NATALIE!!
well shit i guess i have dysphoria //oops
0:01 that is one healthy surveing of irish cream
There is nothing Ann could have done about the cover. The publisher is Springer.
Pretty sure plenty of cis women sleep in bras... I do at least lol. Usually to help not having boobs go all over the place and not underwire but still.
Your video made me realize that I'm aroused by my own body... If I'd not fuck me, I cannot give myself completely to someone else note even feel horny. In anyway I'm trying to validate Blanchard's theory, in fact I find it idiotic. My point in here is, I'm discovering more about myself and sexuality watching your videos than I ever did in any psychiatrist session. And in really thankful for it... For you! And I really can't understand why there are women who hate transgender women. I mean, we all suffer violence from the patriarchy; in different ways, yes, but we're all oppressed by it
Playing baachhhhhhh
Is baileys on the rocks a thing?
This video has helped a lot thank you. ... these video's are sappose to help right.... well fuck it. It helped me.   thank you again.
Starts with an excerpt from Semele! I'm motherfucking hooked.
Ahhh your singing is so lovely
Makes sense that there would be a pre-transition tendency to sexualise or dress in a way that cis men see women, i.e image and body focused, and hence the potential overlap at least superficially with autogynephillic expression, because of the testosterone predominance. Post-transition with hormone therapy you'd expect to see a reversion to more feminine concepts of sexual attraction, which is what you do see. Interesting to view testosterone and estrogen for what they are: extremely powerful drugs that can change both body and mind.
Great video. I find you comments about change in sexuality/attraction very interesting. It gives a good perspective on  why a lot of straight men misinterprets female sexuality. Should make a video on the subject i will make sure to watch it.
He
I've just discovered your channel. You have changed my opinions alot. I really respect how well constructed your arguments are. I also like your light hearted you can be. Im gonna sound like an asshole saying this but to me your the most rational trans person I've ever encountered.
36:23  I just can't get over the fact that Blanchard absolutely shoots down his own position, but instead of admitting he's wrong, he starts making up utter illogical nonsense to explain away the inconsistencies.  It's times like this that I wonder...  is it really possible for someone to be so lacking in self-awareness that he doesn't realize how internally contradictory his position is?  Or that it has no basis in reality?
The way I see it, as a sex positive heretic freak of nature who is into hedonism and depravity, Cher is goals and horny people have rights
Rocky Horror just makes me love you even more. I played Janet for years.
What advice do you have for a person who is a 17yo Japanese girl on the inside, but a male who resembles an otter on the outside?
I just wanna say that your hair is nice
Your nails are always so good aaaa
what is the song at 35 mins? sounds like Aphex Twin SAW
It sounds like Blanchard spent WAY too much time obsessing over trans women.
Really love these videos! I share many thoughts in common and you are very articulate in a way that I will never be lol. Thanks for sharing so much of yourself! Lots of love from a fellow queer transman :)
i hope that patient #655321 is an a clockwork orange reference
Somehow this background music reminds me of final fantasy 7
People are complex :-)
I love this video, it’s so deeply personal and even I can relate to parts. Thanks so much ❤️ And not that it matters but I’d totally fuck you 😉
"Yeah everything sounds scary and pathologic with greek words I can do that too" or whatever the quote is I love you I'm a degenerate too I feel like we'd really get along but I don't know if the Aztec gods that control my life would allow it
Omfg that picture of Anne Lawrence is definitely going to give me nightmares tonight. Yikes.
i googled the fucksaw incident. why, natalie
Been binging your videos all weekend! Thanks for everything you put out! 💗
Yes Bailey is a jerk not a scientist (yes I read about the fucksaw)
3:36 grab a beer and laugh I shall Cheers to narrowly escaping this stupid theory 🍻
This is the best Contrapoints video and potentially the best video when it comes to transfemale experience hands down
First, I wanted to like this video like 5 times or so. Unfortunately it's not possible. Second, I have to tell you, you look sooo pretty in this. Third, I'm so glad you did this, because I once heard about this theory from my friend and although I try to support trans pepole it made me suspicious. So thank you for putting yourself out through humiliation and kinda fear so we all can learn something.  Fourth, ROCKY HORROR!!! xD
I like the silly music.
I'm a cis gal. I wear my bra to bed.
I have an incredible amount of respect for you. It's nothing short of awe-inspiring that you were able to be so open and factual about all this... "Taking one for the team" is almost an understatement, but this is so needed. This is the kind of content that changes hearts and minds.  Much love from 2019!!  PS some cis girls have fallen asleep with bras on - if it's comfy enough, or you're dead tired enough, it's a thing that happens!
I love you but fuck you dogs go to heaven
Only 28 minutes in and this is already so illuminating,
drinking a glass of straight bailey's on the rocks: power move.
Came here from one of your older videos and holy hell you went hard on the  a e s t h e t i c
Top-notch content.
You've sort of opened up another line of thought here about Incels. Incels, at least the ones that talk about being incel, expect women to want men *the same way they want women*. They KNOW they don't meet the same standards they usually hold women to, so they put themselves in the same box they put women they aren't attracted to. But, a lot of girls aren't into sexuality the same way that a lot of men are. They aren't driven by that demon you were talking about...
This was a super interesting and helpful video in terms of helping me with some of my own thoughts; I've not truly begun transition - a lot of my online, though, over the past 5-6 years has been letting myself grow accustomed with having adopted a new name for myself and taking on the appropriate pronouns, even addressing such things to my friends and finding them supportive. In my teenage years I'd always felt very different when it comes to interactions with other guys - the jocks especially I found obnoxious as is, but just a lot of the general attitudes carried as "normal" by guys I didn't really like associating with, nor did my teenage self really like the thought of the male body in the slightest. The female form, I found, was beautiful and appealing. It's something that, as I got older and found among the things I reflected on that stood out to me as I slowly came to realize my own feelings, stood out to me and in a lot of ways the topic of autogynephilia did leave me wondering: do I want to transition because I'd be turned on by myself? Though...as you said, and as I've known from other transwomen I've talked with, the idea of doing it just for a fetish is absurd; I'm lucky to have friends that accept me, that my parents accept me, but there's no telling how people will react until it's out there and in the open and it'll be a matter that came up in any potential relationship in the future as well as with numerous people I've met including one person so apprehensive about speaking to me on the subject that they simply disappeared when I could tell that they wanted to come out as trans from the language they used. No one uproots their life for a fetish.  Currently the one thing I'm thankful for is that my gender dysphoria is thankfully rather mild; there've been days I can't look myself in the mirror, days I've wanted to smash it because I saw myself, and other days where I just don't let myself think about it. I think I could live the rest of my life without ever transitioning but likely not as happily as if I did, but therein of course is the uphill battle of finding a partner who can accept that and such. My libido has...well, since getting past 25 or so I feel like it's not the same as I remember of my teenage years; it feels more like a mix of what was described of your before and after starting hormones. Visual cues and intimate, more personal and emotional moments work for arousal, and while an orgasm is nice I never find myself craving sex 24/7.
I love your videos! Always so fascinating and insightful. Plus you have a great sense of humour.
I'm binge watching the fuck out of her videos, amazing job girl
Freak
You're brave!!!!!!!!!!!  And thanks for getting me emotional, at the end!  You FUCK!!  ☮️
I remember you saying in one of your videos that your singing voice sounds "manly" - just so you know, it doesn't. It's bluesy!
Trans man here--can confirm that perfect summary of sexuality changes on HRT. Becoming possessed by  object-based testosterone-style arousal was such a wild ride and ugh it's such a pain in the ass sometimes lol xoxo love ya contrapoints thanks for fighting the good fight
i love you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! your videos make me so happy but they're way better than eating trash food because it is a diet of substantive ideas and thoughts! xxx
Dogs do go to heaven tho.
Love the video keep up the good work ❤️❤️
just wanted to say thanks. Super cool video.
So illuminating and funny! Very on point!
i really wanted to watch this video but now i'm so hangover that seeing bailey's in the intro makes me sick, greetings however, i really like your content
https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/11/transgender-prisoner-who-sexually-assaulted-inmates-jailed-for-life
Who else is on a contra points binge tonight woooooo i have no friends lol
Your channel is one of the greatest and most important on YouTube!
Sending so much love. I’m a queer cis woman, and hearing you open up about your sexual experiences as a man vs as a trans woman actually helped answer some questions about my own sexual identity. I’ve identified as bisexual since high school (and now I’m old and almost 34), but recently, “bisexual” hasn’t felt right to me. I’m attracted to intelligent and kind hearted people, and their sexual identity, race or genitals have absolutely no factor on whether or not I find them attractive. I totally understand what you mean by needing something more than just list to fuel your sexual arousal. You’re a beautiful, amazing, strong woman, and I’m so excited I found your page. Also, I’ve played Magenta and Janet on stage for RHPS. 😎
Can I want men to treat me like a woman while keeping my male body?
I just discovered this channel and, not only is the content awesome, I'm also amazed at how amazing the lighting is. Terrific job there, congratulations !
I wouldn't whistle at you cause IM NOT WORTHY
love, love, love your videos! Please keep it up <3
You were born when I graduated from university.   I see you as a female.  You’re completely feminine in my opinion. ❤️
I’m surprised this was still relevant enough in 2018 to warrant a video. Haven’t read about this theory since 2002.
the idea of there being "clusters" of trans women as described makes sense for entirely different reasons-if a trans woman is feminine in childhood, and is attracted to men, of course she will discover this part of herself earlier on. if someone is already considered different or abnormal as a boy, they will be more likely to start to self-question, and more likely to insist on being a girl so that they can be permitted to do "girl things". but for less feminine trans women who are attracted to women-well, think about how many cis lesbians have a complex relationship with womanhood. add to this womanhood being not something that is forced upon the individual in question, but something that they have to actively claim despite the difficult aspects of it for someone who does not and cannot fit into the rigid, performative roles of heterosexual femininity, of course it is going to take longer.
I am a feminine male. I get a lot of dick.  Where do I fit in in blanchard's theory?
I just saw a vid of urs from 2016 it was interesting
I just found your channel. I have already spent about 2 hours watching just 3 videos of yours. I can now say you are my favorite channel on YouTube. I love your humour, your attitude, your video layout, your intelligence, the research you have put into these topics, the visual aspect of your videos, and your overall personality shown.
6' tall women? dont mind if i die
Sis woman just found your channel I love it😊👏💕💖💞
What's really interesting is me, a ftm non person, the sexual stuff is perfectly accurate. Since taking T my sexuality is like a dudes.  Its wack
this video is great and all but all dogs go to heaven, wtf
it’s not to the extent that trans women experience but i encountered similar bullshit ideology as a trans man and it honestly probably set me back a few years. i already kind of hated myself and then some idea comes along like “hey you know how you wish you were a guy? IT’S BECAUSE YOU JUST THINK MEN ARE SO HOT” and i just accepted it because it lined up with my negative view of myself. turns out i’m trans and really fucking gay, but that experience makes me wonder how many trans people have been kept from happiness because they saw this crap and were in a bad enough place to internalize it.
cis woman here who wears a bra to bed yo
I'm definitely auto sexual, I turn myself on lol.
Oh god I googled the fucksaw. What the actual fuck Bailey. You did THAT in front of a whole class?
If I weren't already married, i'd be proposing marriate to you. You are smart, sexy, and beautiful. And that's all I can say. As a scientistist myselff, in the social sciences, all I can say is that your critiques are right on target.
I find it super interesting to hear how male and female hormones change your sexuality, and how it sort of outlines (at least in this case) the difference between male and female sexuality. I’m a cis/het asexual woman who is mostly decided but ever so slightly unsure of my sexuality. I’ve felt horny exactly once that I can remember, back at the start of puberty. I’ve only been turned on by physical contact once, but had no desire to do anything other than touch (honestly it was probably more a reaction to physical stimulus than an emotional/mental desire), and the thought of kissing or more doesn’t appeal to me, yet I very much enjoy wearing lingerie and some of my girl friends and I go out about once a month to go “shopping”, and by shopping I mean try on the absolute skimpiest, sexiest things possible in various stores because it’s fun. Because of my love of dressing “like a hoe”, some people have doubted that I’m asexual, which has caused me to doubt myself on occasion, but the more I think about it the more I’m convinced that so-called “autogynophilic” behaviors are just completely normal for most women and has nothing to do with wanting to fuck oneself, (I’ve actually never masturbated and have never had the urge to do so), but rather a way to boost self confidence and assure ourselves that we’re desirable or even to have fun and appreciate ourselves. It’s the same as looking in the mirror and smiling at a good hair day.  Anyways, this is a super rambling and pointless comment on an old video but I just wanted to get my own take on things down. I don’t care who you are or what you identify as, if you appreciate your own body that’s normal and says nothing about your sexuality.
Girl, there is so much better literary porn than 50 shades of grey.
For God's sake woman, what is the song you sang to the mirror?
Zoe Blade's music reminds me of Nine Inch Nails.
I just wanted to pop in to say that there are actually a lot of cis women that sleep in their bras and many of them do it purely because that is more comfortable for them.
Cis women do sleep in bras, i can't sleep without one
What aria is that at the beginning?
You, Natalie Wynn, are fucking incredible! I'm blown away by your videos. Thanks for being so awesome and making the sacrifices I'm sure you've made, in doing what you're doing here.
Thank you for educating a formerly transphobic man when it comes to trans issues. ✌🏻This video along with many of your other videos has really helped me to begin understanding why this concept makes perfect sense and why I need to be much more understanding to be a good person in general.
Hey, spironolactone! I take that too. Does wonders for slowing the growth of my femme beard (cis female w/ PCOS)
The song at the end made me cry, what’s up with that
I love you. Honestly
Natalie, I'm a pre-everything, recently cracked trans woman who found out about you via the online trans community and, even though I'm writing this comment in March of 2019, this is the first of your videos I've watched. Now I'm binging your channel. You are such a beautiful person, and I don't just mean your looks. You probably won't even see this comment in the sea of well-deserved attention you get from all of your fans, but I just had to say something. I wish I knew you, or at least more trans women like you, personally - but at the very least, you make YouTube a better place and I appreciate that you're doing this.
That’s why Silence of the lambs is really cool, in the film They immediately dismiss the theory that Buffalo Bill is a real trans person, he’s actually just some sort autogynephile/CSGF-iser, and it’s a good way to slip in the distinction that gets detected subconsciously under most people’s radar
I just want to confess to being a cis chick who always sleeps in a bra out of sheer convenience. Ain't nobody got time to put a bra on every damn morning when you could just never take it off in the first place (except, of course, to shower or wash it).
I just stumbled upon your channel the other day, been binge-watching ever since! And realized today you are the woman who's photo I saw in some random context like 6 months ago and saved just because it was so beautiful (one of those with like green and purple lighting or similar) - had no idea who you were. Thank you for such great,  funny videos! Ps. You remind me so much of Winona Ryder
I hope Natalie loves herself now because if not I love her enough for both us 💕
I'm starting to get the feeling that these elderly, tenured professors just really enjoy getting a rise out of the young'ns and go about it in really stupid ways.
Somehow, through your discussion of your sexual burgeoning and metamorphosis, you've given me some understanding as to where my sexuality is in relation to others. Where it's limits are to an extent as well. I struggle with this, and so I appreciate this a great deal. Perhaps with enough people talking about this I may understand where I am in this crazy world.
Afab here. Enby by trade. I wear a bra to bed. I don't like my tatas flopping about. It creeps me out. Not quite cis, but I don't think it's that uncommon. I don't wear underwire though. That's just painful.
Your courage humbles me.
I can relate to so much of your sexual history, apart from the fact that I'm stuck in the stage of being left unsatisfied. I don't know if I should talk to a psychologist.
1:58 What is this scene from?
Took me a while to notice, but her lighting reminds me a whole lot of Jojo manga covers
“I don’t want to be whistled at by someone who wants to whistle at me” nooo it’s so relatable  On a more serious note, female and male sexualities are so different and you explained that perfectly
Thank you for your courage, your intelligence, and your incisive analysis, leavened by enough humor to keep things moving. I feel I understand a little better.
Started wearing corsets for renfairs and Rocky Horror, and now I just where them almost daily.  I love A-line dresses and belts and they look so much better with a waspie on. It's not what I wear to the grocery store, but when I put on makeup and want to look sharp. There's a corset.
is there a way to ask some questions 1 on 1? i have some personal concerns relating to my identity that id like to discuss.
Are you an adept? J michael standing in masonic stance noticed that.
that song at the end was gorgeous just sayin
You are so obviously intelligent and also so emotionally screwed-up. You made such a telling statement in saying that as a young man you felt that women would never feel the same about you as you did about them.
Let me get this straight (ha), women who are trying to court women are less attractive to men, than women who are trying to court men. Who could have guessed?
45:42 "But I'd like cis people to think a little bit harder"   If we were capable of doing that, the world would be a better place :(
I like that tidbit about the women you were intimate with suggesting you dress up for sex. I think they were feeling your 'female essence' deep down, whatever that means. I sure could feel it for the entirety of this video.  This was very brave, and very insightful. Thank you for finding the courage to do this, it's been incredibly informative and I hope people watch it until the end. BTW you look incredibly pretty.
This was so validating for me, hearing another trans woman talk about her experience and how you came to terms with things making your own realizations.  Thank you!
... I sleep in my bra because I don't feel comfortable sleeping naked 👀👀... idk why, I just can do it. Maybe body issues?
As somebody who's passed out drunk in a bra, I really hope that you sleep in ones that don't have that hard thing in them, because from experience... I swear that thing is conscious and waiting for the perfect opportunity to pop out and start stabbing. Also, idk if it's reassuring or irrelevant for me to say this (I hope the former), but you said cis women don't sleep in bras but I've known a few who do.
Thank you! I've never been able to tease out the actual theory of Autogynephilia from the lurid writing as every time I try I just see red and decide I have better things to do.
"Hey, I didn't come here for the filth!"  _watches the filth_  "Yep, I totally came here for the filth."
Thank you for the videos you make.  It must be hard at times to remain neutral and show both sides.  I enjoy your comedy, skepticism (to both sides), and in depth discussion on these topics.
What the actual fuck
I am in love with your videos. Thank you for all your hard work giving this lesbian another view point of the world. (I’m also in love with you, just don’t tell my wife. 🤫😘) 😂
Hearing how different are the "male" and "female" sexuality aspects is oddly depressing. Btw I feel only the mind of a huge egomaniac narcissist can give birth to such hypothesis like the one discussed in this video.
and I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me. XD omg i died.
Bruh I've been watching these videos for a fat minute and didn't even fuxkin know she was trans
My ex came out as trans to me a few years ago and the way you spoke about your sexuality, having to “leave your body” is almost exactly how they described heterosexual sex and many other things you said are similar to how they talked about themselves and their body. They didn’t want to transition because of their right-wing family and the thought that they would never pass being 6’4” and having a deep voice and I didn’t know how to help them or ease their dysphoria. We broke up and from what they’ve told me after and what I’ve seen of them they have dropped the idea of transitioning and I think about them often because I know how they felt and what they probably still go through and I tried but I really didn’t do right by them because I broke trust and just didn’t know how to treat the situation. You are an inspiration and a light and you’ve helped me understand and not just blindly accept trans identity. 🌸
This one is way better. Your singing could use a bit more energy. Also you don't hit everything. Makes me feel better about my own failures. Thanks for that. Still I'm not half as good as you are. More Piano!
ContraPoints, Natalie... Thank you for the effort you put on your videos. I have gained a lot more perspectives since I started watching your channel and not only that I also learned a lot about my own Self (myself? xD) in the process. Again Thank You! Cheers!
awww she's finally singing
God damn i knew i heard Peter@
I am a year late, but as I watch all of your videos, this is again really instructive and I thank you for taking the time to do it. You are a beautiful and awesome woman, go get them.
You have a very beautiful singing voice and a refreshingly altruistic point of view :) I appreciate you
That line of "This video is too long I'm getting cranky!" Made me laugh so hard
OMG . . . I didn't ever even consider that I could be an autogyno- wtf ever , can I still be PART THAT if I wanna keep my HRT inspired clitoris and my implanted boobies - or must I go through with an unwanted srs when I still am attracted to WOMEN and only a curiosity for cock?   Jeeeze - I'm now 5 years into my own active transition, and you just confused tf out of me [:sadface: now ]   BUT You my dear - YOU certainly have my attention! Like Rachel Maddow, I'd like to climb you like a jungle gym; my God - what a sapio-sensual Siren you are!   If I could have one wish? well, two maybe, one would be that you'd slow down the pace and tempo just a bit, as the vocabulary you are using has left me in the dust at about 32 minutes in - the blurry focus knob behind my temples that resonates from the audible vibrations - it started to give this cloud over effect, like when I start to have a visual stroke from circulatory issues and the carotid?   no? never experienced that?   oh well   I dig you ♥ you should find me and I'll be the little spoon as you explain it all slowly and softly, right in to my intimate ears
I'm not gonna lie, as a trans women I have a small amount of autogynephilia. But it's only like, .5% of the reason i transitioned. And I haven't really experienced it sense transitioning.... maybe I was just a horny teenager.  Also, I definitely have a feminine essence.... am I a bad trans-girl?
Some cis women slept in their bras every night for 15 years, and have only recently relaxed enough about their, ahem, frontal volume, to entertain a baggy t-shirt and the rest of the world's general indifference. It's all good, and in no way sets you apart. Thanks for your openness and your excellent idealogical dissections. Cheers.
What about men? What has to say Mr. Blanchard about trans men? Everybody seem to forget them.
isn't 200mg of spiro overkill? I can't get estrogen yet (have to get diagnosis and see an endo) and I'm trying to start DIY-ing with spiro and from what I've read, 100mg basically nukes your testosterone.
This video makes me nervous about being on T and having that change my sexuality that way
“...The fuck song incident. Google it.” Me, steeling myself: Ok, hopefully this won’t be any worse than the time someone suggested James Joyce’s letters.....Huh. I don’t see any thing with that title, I...wait. Why does this say “dildo saw”? Oh God, am I supposed to be looking for a “FUCK SAW?” Oh...oh God. It is....it is....

37:56 Well, of course, it makes perfect sense, it's the Auto-Oedipal Electra Complex: If, as a boy, what you see as preventing you from having sex with your mother is not her relationship with your father, but her relationship with herself (masturbation, narcissism), you turn your Oedipus complex at yourself, making you resent being a man, thus developing an Electra complex, so you want to replace your mother as the one who, as you said, fucks your father.  (In case it's not abundantly obvious: This is a joke expanding on Contra's dig at Freudian psychology; I don't actually believe this. Although I'm sure somebody does…)
I am so different from you, and yet we are both trans.
It is great learning about transwomen and their experiences, but as a transman I sometimes feel (unfairly) like they are "complaining about nothing". Now, as I said, that is unfair and I don't really believe that, but us transmen are basically perceived as non-existent. I suppose that's very similar to how lesbians must have felt about gay men in the past. For the record, I do not think transwomen "have it better" or are ACTUALLY complaining about nothing (they have plenty to complain about, people aren't exactly nice to them) than transmen, I was just trying to describe my feelings and point of view. Please do not come after me. Unless you're a troll, then I'll troll you back.    I probably shouldn't even leave this comment but I spent a fair amount of time writing it so I guess I will. I am sorry if I offended anyone. I certainly did not mean too. I'm just frustrated.
Also I’m a cis woman and pretty sure I’m turned on by the thought of being a woman
I love you
I'm cis and I totally wear my bra to bed lol
Contrapoints, you've made such positive impact in my life. Every single one of your videos resonates profoundly with me. My hope is to pay it forward and help change the minds of others. In the meantime, whenever my students ask me if I'm a boy or a girl, I'll keep on saying: "I'm a person!" 加油，加油～
I’m 22, and my own experience is really, really similar to yours. I’ve never heard anything like it described so candidly and I’ve never felt less crazy. Thank u
hi... cis woman here. I sleep in a bra because I actually find it comfy
Your point about cis women developing into their own feminity as teens is on point. For myself, that took some time gain some sense of. Transwomen deserve the same patience and privacy to have a sense of feminine self.
You are a great human being, your vlog is amazing.
You know what, as a guy who used to feel like a girl and sometimes dress as something of the sorts until got, actually, made a woman by an incubus and, that way dispelling all gender dysphoria (I don't have the need to feel like a woman anymore and, anyway, would never let a guy enter me) and, perhaps cause of the bloody injections they give me every 3 weeks, I'm not feeling a slave to my dick anymore and, sorry girls, wouldn't fuck a woman again, specially to "have babies" (fuck that) so, maybe, Natalie, maybe I could hook up with you cause, you know? You're amazing. I always admired intelligence and, sorry girls, you ain't this charming. Well done, Natalie, keep it up, some good day you will find someone who loves you and that'll be a sad day for us cause then you will stop making these most amazing videos but... that'll be a different day... LOTS of love and warmth and RESPECT. Your friend and well wisher, Alex J.
wait ... you mean dogs do not go to heaven?! unsubscribed!
I´m born with the gender I identify as and I am attracted to the opposite sex and I find that video amazing - again.  highly entertaining, very educative, though the english is hard to understand for me 100%, I think I got most of it, and by god you are so damn sexy, thats at least 20% of why I watch your videos.
Using a term 'soul' in scientific theory - isn't that a contradiction, especially since philosophy has already explored the body-mind problem so graciously. Born in 1988 says hello!
u have a really nice voice its really calming
This is not on topic at all, but as a point of reference on the bra thing (44:30ish), many women do wear bras to bed, especially women with big boobs obvi bc I dont need shit flying around, but also for comfort, convenience, whatever. This of course, assumes that your bra supports your boobs without leaving wrist hair tie-like marks on your ribs. PSA: If your bra is uncomfortable enough to leave red marks on your skin, it almost certainly means you're wearing the wrong size!!! Obviously, you can do whatever you want, I dont really care about who's wearing a bra and when, but I wish more people knew that bras don't have to be ridiculously uncomfortable
I fucking love you.
okay i had not expected that. a trans woman who did not feel like a woman before transitioning. my family has always considered transsexuality to be something innate. i said it was ultimately a choice, because i felt they victimized transsexuals and put them on a pedestal. but i thought it was the way i feel hetero. like the way i could 'choose' to do gay stuff but i never would because it does not interest me. it turns out your transexuality is not at all like that. you used to be a lot more like myself than i expected. you could have gone on as a guy, but you had some experiences i never would have and that shaped your choice to do something else. i even recognize the 'demonic male sexuality' thing. i did something with that because well dont we all want to relate to women as human beings? it just wasnt anything like you did. it was nofap.
TW at 1:55 and 4:20. Silence of the Lambs clip of the murderer saying "I'd fuck me". SotL is a huge dysphoria trigger for me. I still love this video though and really appreciate the insights into your past and your transition. You have an awesome story! I started hrt almost a year ago myself (injection).
Is this Jenna Marbles?
You are amazing.
I slept in a bra for years as a teenager, living as a cis girl. It's not that unheard of!
i too am a woman who sleeps with a bra. Sisters <3
women find it sexy for men to want them because unfortunately their value is too much placed in how men view them.
It was awesome to watch your video - thanks! I´ve been reading so much to gain insights and in order to see light at the end of the tunnel and soothe my inner turmoil. Here you give me an extremely entertaining and really funny summary of most of the stuff I read, thanks very much again. I´m still unsure, though. Anyways, it was a relief to see there can be a serious, yet humoristic, self-ironic way to see things...Love and Peace
I didn't know that Natalie was such a talented musician in addition to being a great video makerer.
As a somewhat afeminate cis male I'd definitely fuck myself if I could.
Now that makes me question how my sex drive or sexuality would change since I am asexual and I would like to take more hormones to be androgynous...
18:18-23:07 Damn I feel like two thirds of all that is basically myself! Or maybe even more than 2/3...
Not sure how much value this holds for you since it is just a YouTube comment but there are moments when I forget that I forget that you're a trans woman. In fact for the most part I remember it because you mentioned it. Hope one day you can comfortably sleep without a bra like most women.
25:10 Male masturbation is obviously gay, because you're using a male hand-- your own! It's homosexual sex people!
I would honestly like the phrase "It's great, but it's not _that_ great" on a shirt. That quickly encapsulates exactly what I think of physical attraction as a cis woman. It ultimately isn't about some dude's hot body or attractiveness. I'm not _denying_ that hot men are nice to look at, but at the end of the day, it's only something to look at, and that really isn't the wish fulfillment that most cis women look for, at least in my experience, and it certainly isn't what I look for.
Holyshit we're born in the same year but you aged 20x better
You're awesome.
Nice Plinkett name drop :)
I THINK YOU'RE SEXY AND I WANNA FUCK YOU please pick me
on the one hand i want to watch your videos all day and praise you for being extremely insightful and intelligent and on the other i want you to bang me because you are hot
I hate that I share a name with one of these scientists 'cause when you speak to him directly it feels like I'm being called out its really so yeah fuck you transposphobic scientist. Aside from I though this very informative and I share the sentiment of some others in the comments you said they can gain the perspective on an experience they can never have
30:24 "I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me."  ...I just thought that was funny. 😋
Thank you for presenting this.   Another piece of the complexity of the Trans topics.  And, oh yeah: "transphobia" is not a real thing. Please stop using all 'phobia" terms that can't exist. Since you are using as much science as possible in your vids, I am sure your credibility about all topics will improve, by not using such non-scientific crap terms.
How did I miss this one?  Natalie, thanks for being so open.  It can't be easy, and I appreciate your willingness to bare yourself to the degenerate population of the internet.  Also, didn't know you played piano.   You're an even cooler lady than before.
Girl, you are a hero! 🙌🏻
Love your vids <3
This was wonderful, I'm in no way trans, but it's wonderful to have someone put words to what women's smut looks like, and you described it in a way that I'm going to shamelessly steal when I get the chance
"Patient #655321"  Nice subtle Clockwork Orange reference there
I had some TERF accuseme of this... My response was that I've had dysphoria since I was 2 years old... I wasn't sexually active or having sexual fantasies at that age. The reason I came out in my 40s is because I was raised in a far right highly patriarchal family with no internet and  no access to anyone or anything that could help me. When your father has GBH charge for gay bashing you learn quite quickly to keep quiet and let him think he has beaten it out of you. Eventually hiding and denial become 2nd nature.   I married my wife because she was kind and accepting when I told her I was trans before we married. I don't care what a person looks like or if they are male or female... I like people who are kind to me. Not many men are like that.  Gender dysphoria is like a deep sadness. Anxiety. Fear. Shame. And an intense longing. And an irrational disgust/hatred of minor things that remind us of the binary social order. It is not fun or sexy.  Sometimes our bodies will give us erections when we feel elation and happiness... These are not sexual. However acting on them replaces the happiness with guilt and shame... It replaces our need to have our mind and body match with disgust that we must somehow be perverted which means we must be cis after all... It's a lie we tell ourselves.   Once you accept who you are any sexual perversion we tell ourselves ends. I was never turned on by my need to be a woman... That was true when I was a child and it is still true.  I would love to be cis. I would love it if there was a cure. It would be so much easier if this was a perversion. But sadly it is not a perversion and I am a dysphoric transgender. Life gave me a curve ball and the baying crowds hate me for missing the ball(s).
Cockbane always gets my rod wet
How am I just discovering you now?!
Why'd you work with Peter "fake Asian waifu" Coffin?
I love you so much right now.
"...Science often privileges a white cishet male prospective." THANK YOU!!! Too many are simply not aware enough to understand that this is a serious issue when discussing sexual behavior and psychology.
https://www.reddit.com/r/TGandSissyRecovery/
Thank you for being educational to this cis male. I have a hand full of gay friends, but as it has been pointed out on many subjects. It’s not their burden to educate me on topics. It’s nice to have a raw first account to such topics. I know you don’t speak for all queer culture, but you’ve been a valuable source for better understanding. Thank you for your videos. Oh, I think you’ve got great comedic timing too. Looking forward to checking out your full catalog of videos.
If it helps, I’m a cis woman who sleeps in a bra for pretty much the same reason you gave. I think it might just be a small boobs thing as my chest is roughly the same size as yours
If you take dick pics and send them to other people that's some sort of weird.  And I'm a straight guy... guess I'm just too autistic to see the point.  I like sticking it into people, they can imagine what the thing looks like until then.
And here I thought autogynephilia would be touching one's own female anatomy for sexual gratification reasons.  Not sure if that makes me better or worse than Dr. "spends suspicious amount of time thinking about trans women exclusively"  Also, sartorial, boss word.  I have to look that sucker up every time I trip over it but it's a boss word.
Psychology, sociology and sexology are not developed enough fields to be called scientific in the first place...
I find you pretty desirable, and I think I have good taste. I like independent films at the Charles.
T R A N S   I D E A O L O G Y
@ContraPoints To my increasing surprise and delight, your content has been incredibly helpful in my personal journey. I have often been excluded and belittled by "people on the left", including trans people, almost as much as I have been excluded and belittled by "people on the right", including trans people. Having gender "dysphoria" has made me atypical enough, but then the *way* in which I have it is atypical compared to almost every other case of it I have heard about or witnessed.  (For instance, a part of my personal owning of my situation is placing the word "dysphoria" in quotes when referring to my condition, and even after explaining why in detail, I have never found another person who carries the condition quite in the same way I do, and I have even been insulted, belittled, and actually called evil because of it.)  After listening to your personal story here, this is the first time in a long time I've actually felt like there might be a person close to my situation who might possibly sympathize with and understand my own experiences. So, forgive the unusual (and, admittedly, borderline creepy) nature of all this, but: Thank you. Like, personally and deeply. Your existence, at least what you've been willing to share of it, gives me hope.
This video officially blew my mind. Awesome.
Comparing your masculine sex drive to a demonic possession really hit home to me. Thank god mine is starting to calm down a bit now in my 30s.   I really appreciate these videos. I was lagging on choosing enlightenment on the reality of trans experiences and the suffering of trans people. I sincerely thank you for your willingness to be publicly vulnerable about this. It is helping me turn my sympathy into empathy.
Wow what a journey you are on. Thank you for sharing it and in such an awesome way. I've just discovered you today am so impressed.
Your transition music sounds like the beginning of Count Bleck's theme from Super Paper Mario and honestly I'm seeing the similarities in your gothic aesthetics and how extra you both are
“Men’s bodies are great. They have great hands, great abs, great this part...” 😂
“Men’s bodies are great. They have great hands, great abs, great this part...” 😂
"A perspective on trans women from someone who isn't a cis man, preposterous" she said, sarcastically
I love Uooooooo😍😍😍😍😍😍
As a scientist, all this shit reeks of "researchers" just fitting research to prove something they already believe.  They come up with theories to illegitimize transsexuals... Because they already believe transsexuals are illegitimate.  It's not just really shitty antipathetic behavior... It's bad fucking science.
Can we all just simply have sex already? :) Without all the judgement and categorisation.... That's my vision of the future anyhow...
Omg your singing is amazing ♥ ♥ ♥ I cried
You gotta be an asshole and also try really hard not to see you as a woman, you get discriminated as a woman and worse, you speak from a woman's perspective. I def feel more identified with you (being bi but cis) than I do to other cis women, specially non queer. Also I do sleep on my bra because otherwise having them bouncing around just hurts =(
There are so many intellectual comments down there, but im just here to say: I love you videos and online persona, ContraPoints! they are so well edited and written, witty and educational. I look forward to every one of your uploads.
So...Bailey wrote a love letter to his own sexual attraction to trans women and 'feminine' men, and then passed it off as a "scientific study", even though he knew it would  demonise those people he was so attracted to? What the hell, dude?
As a cis woman, you hit the nature of female sexuality on the god damn head. Male sexuality has a lot to do with visual appreciation, whereas female sexuality has a lot to do with being wanted by a qualified person. It’s a lot about feeling sexy because this person thinks I’m sexy.
I know commenting on a year old YouTube video about a minor detail is silly, but just so you know, I'm a cis woman who for a large part of my adolescence slept in a bra.   In my case it was because I felt shame that the shape of my breasts was not what I thought was acceptable or attractive in their natural state, so I wore a bra to make them feel more like the shape I thought they should be.  You are not alone in wearing a bra to sleep due to discomfort in the way you perceive the bodily quality of your breasts and their relation to your value as a woman.  So even your example of something no cis woman would do at least one cis woman did, and not even for wildly different reasons. Lots of women feel the desire to see their own body as desirable & change their behavior to that end, even when they are alone, in the dark, with their eyes closed, asleep.   I'd gander every individual sexual and performative behavior anyone has ever used to describe a trans woman as autogynephillic could also be observed in at least some form in some cis women.
Can you tell him how much
❤❤❤❤
1. Bailey and Blanchard aren't the first CIS/het/Caucasian prigs to milk the cash cow of our angst. [cough] John Money [cough] 2. Nature isn't big on binaries.  3. You carry on being the highly entertaining, lovely, amusing, beautiful snowflake you are.  Note: I need you to pretend that I'm six when you interpret what I mean by 'snowflake.' I'm not six, so I do get that there are a lot of stupid connotations associated with that word. I didn't intend any of them. I'm just too lazy to find another word that can represent 'unique' and 'beautiful' whilst eluding to the unique quality of the snowflake to join with it's fellows and drastically alter our perception of the landscape.
I found this video hard to see because it made me feel a lot of mixed feelings, at some point i almost cried, but in the end all can i say to you is thank you for making it.
I loved this so much, thank you.  Also just wanted to say, my best friend when I was younger, a cis girl, wore a bra to bed every single night
1:30 in and i'm already thoroughly blown away by the production value of this. like of all your masterpieces, actually <3
wow, great job on the bach pronounciation!
One of my cis friends told me to look up your channel and holy hell was he blessing me in doing so! I love your channel, love the topics, and love learning about my trans sisters (I'm a trans-masculine person!) Keep up the astounding work!
you had me googling the fuck saw incident. i'm not sure what to say right now but ya your good.
Favorite video of Contra
Good fucking video.
This must have been so hard for you. Thank you for taking the time and emotional energy to share so much.
The opening looks like Heather Chandler crawled out of her grave and is ready to wreck Heather Duke for ever even daring to love herself. I am so ready.
Did Blanchard say mtf women are more accepted by society than effeminate gay men? As one of the latter, that is absolutely false by any measure.
You just found someone who built a sex robot. -<loosely said because I was to busy almost choking on orange juice
Natalie is like the antidote to the oppression Olympics, because she isn't afraid to acknowledge truth in the experience of all identities, including those most maligned in the oppression olympics - namely the shitting on transwomen by TERFs, shitting on incels, shitting on men in general, etc. while also keeping the same cadence of conversation while discussing "higher-order" oppression Olympics groups instead of trying to prove why one is a worse experience than the other. She's a light in the darkness that is this decade, and she has done a lot for me personally in the realm of growth and reconciliation of these internal moral struggles like the one you describe.
you look like a young winona ryder in this video
Should we tell this Blanchard person about asexual trans people?
After listening to the entire Transgender Debate podcast by self proclaimed TERF Alex, who very eloquently expressed  her logic relative to the Transgender Debate, I now get the Alex the TERF point of view. During her podcast,  Alex’s gave an overview Autogynephilia which I found incongruent with my own personal experience as a transgender. Then what can you expect from a non transgender explaining to other non transgenders what being a transgender is all about. Yes incredible “psuedo science” is now being used by TERFs and others to form foundational basis for beliefs pertaining to transgenders. Thank you for calling BS on Autogynephilia.
Thank you for your deep insights and you willingness to expose your deepest soul and experiences this way.
I’m a straight cis woman and wow some parts where you were talking about your post transitional feelings perfectly describes my own feelings that I’ve never been able to accurately describe so thanks this was super well written and informative ! Also I know some cis girls that sleep with bras
As a cis straight woman... I agree and see what you mean. Yeah, men are attractive, but their physical appearance isn’t THAT attractive. There are other things that are much more appealing than their body.
Me: wears corsets, fishnets, sleeps in a bra, tries to do natural makeup that inevitably turns into drag looking makeup, and does basically everything else in this video she says most cis women don't do. *Shit* 😂 as that one character of hers would say, cis women really are hopeless
Oh my god. An anticapitalist philosophy channel with 45 minute gender theory videos AND Vaporwave lighting??? I’ve never felt so seen
Damn right, looking at a mirror seeing myself wearing lingerie 100% turns me on and faster than any muscular man can.
but dogs DO still go to heaven, right?
I've seen kinks that make even the most far left  athiestic people I know skin crawl, wheras I have no reaction to those kinks.  Don't ask me about my kinks unless you plan to marry me.
Hi there! I wanted to thank you very much for this video, very helpful. So, I'm a man (argh, it's painful to say). I have autogynephilia, even if I don't like this term because I find it a bit reducing. I would never consider myself trans for the reasons you explained in your video, but I always felt closer to the queer communities than the average cis dude because of my sexuality. Do I consider myself a pervert? I guess, but in a good way :D  I do though "fantasize" about my gender in a less sexual way, that's why I like being considered as a woman on the internet for example. For this reason, I don't consider myself cis neither. I guess I have some case of gender fluidity? Anyway, I'll never try transitioning for several reasons, first because it might alter my own sexuality as you explained, and of course because of the amount of courage and self-dedication needed (I am really admirative of transwomen for that). But if a magic switch could exist...  Anyway, your video inspired me to talk about my own perspective, sorry! Love from France <3
Hey, dunno if you check comments on your older videos, but I am a cis woman, at least that's what the doctor told my parents when I got into this world, and I sleep in  bras. Cause I find it comfortable, and I feel weird when I don't have something supporting my boobs, no matter how small they are.
Congrats. Im a 28-year-old argentine musician with a kind of left ideology and a lot of confusion about gender and sex topics. After just 1 week knowing this chanel...i will have to see what i am now. Don't stop
ok saying that ALL transwoman are like that is wrong,but definitly thats a thing. i even meet one ON REAL LIFE that admitis it (having autoginefilia) with all words to me,so yeah...
Second time watching this and this is a ridiculously good video, even by Contra's standards. I'd never heard of this revolting autogynephelia nonsense before and I'm glad that I encountered it for the first time here.
I would love to go to Rocky Horror but I have social anxiety and a phobia of crowds of people. *shrug*
How do you pull off so many characters? It'a crazy. Like the costumes and cinematography, DAMNNN.
Yo as a cis and (mostly) het woman this was genuinely reassuring for me to hear about my own sexuality. I’ve thought for ages that deep down I must be pretty narcissistic because a large amount of my strongest sexual fantasies are of men being attracted to me, and yes I genuinely do feel almost attracted to my own body. Someone I’m attracted to being attracted to me whilst thinking I’m a man wouldn’t make me happy at all, whereas someone being attracted to me because they think I’m a woman would.  Maybe that’s because my brother is trans, and as he came out while I was young I questioned my own gender as well, wholeheartedly concluding that I am in fact most comfortable as a woman. And the sheer joy I got when I started looking more womanly, which I still get seeing myself naked, is almost sexual. Autogynephilic? Maybe, and god knows it’s hot if a guy finds me hot, but I think that’s a mixture of sexual enjoyment and general happiness that comes from your gender and attractiveness as that gender being validated.  And getting to the point here, hearing another woman explain this to me so clearly has really cleared this up for me, and made me feel assured that a lot of other women experience this as well.  So, thank you
Genius simply amazing!!!!
Laughs in masculine nonbinary
I love these videos. They help me re-examine my own biases preconceived notions.
Thank you so much for uploading this video.  I remember when a group of us first encountered this typology at uni, when after a tutorial a person wanted to discuss this 'scientific view of the *trans agenda* that explains so much'. We thought we were clocked and attacked and just ran away. I wonder now sometimes if that was the case, considering ho open they were to talk about it with us.  I wasn't able to stand and talk back at that person then, and even if I did, I doubt I could remain calm and go through the facts like you.  So thank you once again for talking and sharing!  <3
I, as cis woman, sleep in a bra.
FIX THE CANDLES... pls?
I'm so glad she learned how to blink
Happy birthday to this video
Weird that these people always leave out transmen *casually sips beer*
all transphobes have the same fucking attitude about trans people: that our voices, opinions, sentiments, experiences, and perspectives are not, for whatever reason, valid.  they simply cannot make the claim that there is something inherently wrong about our identity without making this dehumanizing suggestion. one i don't see often made about ANY other state, mental condition, mental illness, or whatever the fuck you think being trans is.  it is simply biased, and dehumanizing at its core, and it can't really ever be brought across in a way that isn't. as trans people, according to them, we aren't human, we are defects, freaks, crazy people, and above all our opinions are invalid. well i have a lot to say. not that prejudiced people are going to fucking listen though, no matter how much i yell. maybe if enough of us yell and protest and rationally argue with these idiots, we can get through, and we can be heard.  *I'M A FUCKING HUMAN. MY OPINIONS ARE VALID. YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP PRETENDING THAT WE DON'T BOTH EXIST AND HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT YOU LITERALLY ATTACKING OUR IDENTITIES!!!!! WE ARE FUCKING HUMAN!!! DO YOU EVER CONSIDER HOW WE MIGHT FEEL WHEN YOU SAY THIS SHIT? OH FACTS DON'T CARE ABOUT MY FEELINGS? SO YOU DON'T THEN?? GOOD TO KNOW BECAUSE GUESS WHAT MY FEELINGS DON'T CARE ABOUT FACTS!!! AND APPARENTLY YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT FACTS EITHER BECAUSE THE FACTS SUPPORT US AND THE FACTS ARE THAT WE EXIST!! AND YOU NEED TO STOP TREATING US LIKE WE'RE CRAZY LITTLE DELUSIONAL WHINY BRATS AND LISTEN TO OUR GODDAMN VALID OPINIONS. AM I NOT A VALID RESPECTABLE HUMAN JUST BECAUSE I WASN'T COMFORTABLE IN MY BODY, BECAUSE I, (GASP) **_SUFFERED_** !!!???? AND NOT ALL TRANS PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED EITHER!!!! I AM NOT A FUCKING VICTIM. STOP MAKING ME A GODDAMN VICTIM WITH YOUR SHIT MOUTHED PREJUDICE HIGH HORSED STUPID COWARDLY TRADIONALISM THAT YOU ADHERE TO SO STRONGLY YOU ARE WILLING TO GODDAMN HURT OTHER PEOPLE TO KEEP IT YOU FUCKING SELFISH PRIVLEDGED  COWARDLY BASTARDS I HOPE YOU BURN IN THE HIGHEST DISHONOR DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE HURT AND SUICIDE YOU MAY HAVE CAUSED YOU HAVE NO IDEA NO IDEA WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE IN MY SHOES AND YOU NEVER WILL BECAUSE YOU AREN'T TRANS AND I AM AND LISTEN UP WE ARE FUCKING SICK. AND. TIRED. OF THE DISRESPECT. BOW ON YOUR KNEES BEFORE NATALIE AND LISTEN TO WHAT A GODDAMN TRANS PERSON HAS TO SAY FOR ONCE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT FREAKS, WE ARE NOT ALL CRAZY, WE ALL NOT ALL PERVETS, WE ARE IN FACT WHO WE CLAIM TO BE AND WE DESERVE TO BE LISTENED TO AND NOT IGNORED!!! WHEN YOU DO SOME GODDAMN RESEARCH ABOUT TRANS PEOPLE, MAKE SURE YOU ACTUALLY LISTEN TO WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY INSTEAD OF TREATING US LIKE ANIMALS TO BE STUDIED. WE ARE NOT ANIMALS WE ARE HUMAN. SIT THE FUCK DOWN AND SHUT THE FUCK UP. WE HAVE VALID PERSPECTIVES.*  sorry that felt good to get out  they all have this same stupid attitide. trans person: "i'm this-"  transphobe: "oh no no no, you're not. i know more about your identity than you do, obviously."
Happy 1 year anniversary to this masterpiece :)
This is brilliant. You're obviously a smart lady.
I googled Fucksaw. It was disappointing.
That guys writing sounds like r/iamverysmart posts
Wow, I find your experience really interesting. I always kinda thought that male and female libido were fundamentally different. Male sexuality being more physical, visual, and female being more emotional, personal. As a dude, I kinda feel bad about it, especially when talking about it with women, because I end up feeling like a superficial prick who only cares about looks. It's fascinating that you not only can talk about both perspectives, but also can relate it directly to your hormonal situation. Thank you, honestly. I feel less like an asshole :)
Oh my god. The reading of the passage from The Man Who Would Be Queen around 7:50 sounds like the Hormone Monster being interrupted by Caleb from Big Mouth. Anyways, carry on with your day
lolllllllll the talk on 44:23 about how a cis woman never wears a bra to sleep. I was at a boarding school at age 14 and when some girls arent developing their boobs (or never gets to) but are jealous of other people having boobs... A girl in the other dorm was wearing a A to D cup push up (and gosh those are uncomfortable) bra when shes sleeping.
Out of curiosity, has she ever adressed the trans suicide rate with regard to dysmorphia in the trans community?
I did find a trans men "equivalent" called autoandrophilia in a book about forensics. it was a definition that was about the same concept, but with the  words "male" and "female" swapped.
I just downed a bottle of wine so might not be coherent. Girl, you rock! Keep up the good fight and I'm sort of happy you feel a bit empowered by wearing a bra because I'm in a 2 week long PMS hell and my tits are killing me if I sleep without one.   If you ever feel like you need help screaming at stuff, msg me. Fuck injustice. ❤️ Booze
The section at 20:00 about age and transitioning and having the body of an older man was interesting. My Dad (note: we've discussed parental terms and decided to stick with 'Dad') is almost in her 60's and only came out 2 years ago. Her journey has been interesting in an age way. Like, she was 'middle aged' and her body was moving rapidly into the 'old man form' but she seems to have gained a new lease on life since coming out and has perfected make-up techniques for older skin. Just wanted to mention this, as age and transgender issues aren't discussed as much but they just popped into my mind when you mentioned the dysphoria experienced at the first signs of 'gendered ageing'. Edit: Also, this video was very good. I discovered your channel today and have basically binged all your uploads. They're very educational while also being entertaining!
Hey I know you brought up all these nice, intellectual points and stuff, but you also said you like being attractive. I'd lick milk off of those tiddies.
i love the eerieness
Nataly, by the end of this video I wanted to cry, you have put yourself in such a vulnerable place for the "team" and I feel I understand trans experiences a lot better now. Thank you so much for what you do.  - A cis woman from Peru who has a major crush on you
I really loved the video, but I find your casual usage of slurs a bit concerning. I understand it’s probably for ironic purposes, but I couldn’t help but remember your incel video and how you said their slurs and slang managed to worm their way into your inner monologue.  Are you okay? Because it kinda sounds like researching all this transmysoginistic bs to debunk and analyze in your videos might be taking an emotional toll on you. Please stay safe and remember to take care of yourself.
As a lesbian who is trans yeah no 😂🖇👌
Nonbinary. Guess I have dsymorphia in some form. I find myself more arousing the more prominent my skull, ribs, and spine become after fasting. Need to see the skeleton.
The mood light freaks me out a bit brodi
Her staring into my soul while hissing out insults to me is both terrifying and arousing
<3
5:10 that's interesting, do you have similar observations in the case of trans men? I would be interested to learn more about that. I wonder if I fit right into a general cluster, or if I'm an outlier.
Glad you're taking Bailey to task. Truly he is the bane of scientific process and accurate sex research.
i actually do enjoy my own body odor.... XD, most of the time... but then again so do many others, no i didn't bring you kfc or taco bell, that is the area of skin between my arm and torso... ew, thinking about it is gross though, also other things, but only since i've become a girl (started to identify that way) and was checking to see if my feet of all things (and panties, but less so, because i don't make a smell there at all) smelled feminine (ya, i know what feminine feet smell like, and i know what a "good" smell is for them) why you might ask? did i already have interest in myself? no, hell no, i'm fucking ugly, or maybe i am? don't ask anyone who has seen me, they will tell you otherwise, but what i did have was interest in being a domme, a new thing that arized after accepting that i'm a girl, and i knew guys at the time wanted (ya, i also got more interested in guys as i became a girl) to do foot fetish things with me, and i then decided, hey, i need money, girls can sell socks, i am a girl, i have feet, i can sell socks (have not done a thing towards that since btw) so i then checked occasionally and set ones aside that got the right smell, i then, one day was actually turned on by my own smell, like i had to actually ask several people if that was even acceptable at all, i forgot my point, but i'm sure i'm not really the only one tbh, and that though not erotic, was a present like before i was trans or anything of the sort
22:00 lmao, i thought you had a partner tbh, you are still single? i know i don't speak for all people, but i can't help but think that must be your own doing, because you certainly give no reason not to be dated, or at least, in your words, fucked, i feel like i'm talking to a famous person tbh, so please, if you will, can you reassure me how human and reachable an on my level you are, as out of my league you may still be that is XD (what's the opposite of a narcissist?)
damn girl you look young, never would have guessed
can i be cluster B and still be valid in my wanting to be a girl? also i was efeminat or in touch with my feminine side as a child, but i also my actual actions were masculine, it's hard to explain, but i was bigender before i knew what gender was, but i was a male, a guy, a he/him, because that was how i was told things were
Tbh I thought it would’ve meant the love of one’s own vagina
I still want to see autogynephile Harry Plinkett.
Thank you! You are amazing!!!
I would really like to have a conversation about informed consent, I feel like the whole idea is pretty negative, even when transition is someones best bet I really feel like it's a process that people should accompany with therapy becuase at a minimum it would help them through the process. Is my thinking just wrong somehow? I underatnad that it being an option is needed becuase its otherwise to eat to prevent people who are best off transition for from doing so, or at least could, but I feel ots an inferior approach.
Another amazing video! One small clarification; you still have testosterone in your body, all us women have testosterone in our bodies. And all men have estrogen. Its just the balance of these hormones that on average is different . And that balance fluctuates throughout our lives and often simply what day it is.
How are these things so recent? I figured that this Blanchard chap was from the 19th or early 20th century and long dead, given his ideas and writing style. I really live in a dream world where people are treated like, you know... people. Apparently it's still an ideal instead of reality.  Edit: also, god damn impressive music at the end there. You're truly very talented. Perhaps the singing technique could use some work, but I know how fucking hard it is to sing sitting down with your arms up and I can really not sing and play at the same time and definitely not like that! I am also impressed with your intellect and openness. Makes me wish I could be your friend. I'd love to learn more from you and give you some support, but I guess I'll just stick to watching, liking and sharing these videos and of course learning a lot from them. And I'm pretty sure that someone with an amazing character like yours gets plenty of support.
41:11 For those of you who wanted to see the Time Warp again
Forgive my ignorance but what does "TERF" mean?
I love you.
You are beautiful!
Is it weird that I really want to see that Sex Robot video?  Am I.......the degenerate?
Damn it Natalie, I googled the fuck saw incident.  Why?  Why did you make me do this?  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!  <3
wow
Hey Contrapoints.  Thank you so much for this video and other related ones. I've been thinking I was just "agp" and purely fetishistic, but your experience resonated with me. Thank you for helping me with my dysphoria and doubts about my gender in my life.
Thanks for explaining your perspective (RE transitioning). I'm still not sure I'll ever truly understand it, but it helps that I can at least see the reasoning.
Going off my own perspective at least, wanting to be wanted is not a female thing; it's an everyone thing. I'm a cis man and nothing is hotter to me than a woman who is really into me and expresses intense desire for me. Honestly I can't think of anyone who doesn't find someone being into them at least somewhat of a turn on. Hell, just look at yanderes in anime and their weird popularity. It is because having someone who desires you that intensely feels good.
Where can i get that 'Montague and Capulets' cover? Can't find it on Zoe's website..
Aside from how pretty i think you are, i really love how well-spoken you are while providing provocative and pointed entertainment. delightful.
Eloquently handled. As always. ❤️
This has really opened my eyes in terms of sexuality and how men and female experience it differently. I simply assumed the male model of sexuality was the norm but I understand that the female model is a lot different. I actually used to think I was asexual, and with good reason. I wasn't sexually interested in anyone until I turned 18, and even then it wasn't _that_ strong. Even now, if you asked if I like penis or vagina, I'd say none because they both look kinda gross. I consider myself bi. Not sure if that's only romantically if it's sexually. (Maybe I'm more graysexual) I'm also autistic so I'm not sure if that'll have an effect on my sexuality. I need to have a better understanding of sexuality. And yeah, while I am a fujoshi, I don't think that has too much to do with my sexuality oddly enough. (it's complicated)
Is there a word for women who like guys dressed in feminine clothing?
I have to hand it to ContraPoints, this is a masterful sleight of hand for duping dumb normies who will just hear him saying all these big words that don't mean anything, but they think are super intellectual, and decide what he's saying is true. We just need to keep slashing away at the normies with Occam's Razor, i.e. transwomen are men, and not women, because men can't be women.
I've never heard things that I've felt in my heart be said out loud by a person before. Wow. That's a thinker.
As a cis man, I learned a lot from this video. I can use this to be more respectful to any transgender people I meet in the future. Thank you!
big word
Watch out for that Reptilian behind you! Also book dude is stupid. Edit: Also, yes. All dogs go to heaven. Whatever the fuck that is. Don't break my drunk heart. ;_;
When you were discussing how your dysphoria is I honestly was really glad because I never had been able to put that into words. Thank you for that.
fgdhdghdsf that thing about cis feminists and witches tho
Thank you for consistently making accessible, thought-provoking content.
Firstly i wanna praise your courage for talking about such personal experiences in your video, it was very enlightening and so very pertinent!   secondly i have a question  It seems Bailey and Blanchard and so many others have a theory about who or "what" are transwoman but im curious, do their theory apply to trans men (born in a female body but transitioning into a male body)? Or is their theory only about transwomen? If so how do they explain transmen? If they ever do?
"I don't want to be whistled at by people who whistle at me" is the new "I don't want to belong to a club that would accept me as a member".
Love the RHPS bit... I've always wanted to dress as the Sweet Transvestite from transsexual, Transylvania. (Side note, Who would love/fuck you? I would, but after a nice date... I'm not a barbarian.)
Hi, non-binary person here! Thank you for this video, I'll send it to my dad so he calms down about my step grandma (she's trans and dad is a big Bailey's fan)
The main misconception here is to pretend that Blanchard only means that AGP Trans "Looove themselves as women" When actually some simply "WANT to see themselves as a woman"!! Still very different from the HSTS that literally FEEL they are women.  Of course AGP will constantly keep on beeing butthurt about Blanchard theory which,  as imperfect as it is,  still is the closest representation of Transexuality. What about guys attracted by those that either Feel or Want to be females?  Chasers?  That's what we are?  That stupid and simple? Or that's how mostly AGP trans,  not really into men,  would categorize us?  I'm attracted by trans more cis and it's not only sexual either.  We all have our biased vision of the world
As rational as you 😂😂😂😂.  You're the archetype of the narcissistic butthurt autogynephile Trans woman 😅😅.  So rational for sure!  I had doubts about Blanchard theory before watching this.  Well,  not anymore.  You're definitely an AGP,  Girl!!  👍
Women don't get turned on merely by the thought of being women.  What!?  Women are women.  Pure nonsense!
Accusing men who agree with Blanchard theory of Misogynist and homophobes is a really vile and cheap way to protect yourself from the whole theory.  Too easy!!
Doesn't make them autoandrophile  as only some trans ftm could be so.  It just means that they like to play with their dick or wanna seduce u when they send it.  Same thing for women (so absurd btw),  only trans ftm can be autogynephile obviously.  Some cis men and women are obsessed with their body,  not by their own body transformed into the opposite sex. Totally invalid point
I've been devouring this whole channel instead of doing my philosophy homework, and it's been so damn enlightening, heartbreaking and uplifting. You have the incredible power of talking about complex, volatile, and uncomfortable topics fairly, comprehensively, and in such a way that even I can follow along. I know I'm arriving late to this video, but your full disclosure here shows extreme integrity, it can't have been easy deciding to go through with it.   I'm a manly man, goddamit. Stop making me cry.
i know this vid was a while ago but and I think it’s a really stellar video over all but next time would you mind addding a trigger warning for epilepsy as well? If you are going to do that flash-y style of intro
Women are not a costume.
You know what just occurred to me? Blanchard probably got funding for his "research." Most likely, some organization paid for him to hit on women at the bar. Ugh.
what about the sexuality of acting, writing scripts, filming yourself, and editing yourself and producing content in a way that makes yourself laugh gross!
The mention of Buffalo Bill is very much on-point... So many viewers for some reason tag him as a trans woman and call him bad representation, even though in the story itself it's discussed in quite a lot of detail that he's not trans at all. Every doctor he saw found no trace of dysphoria, or any other reason for transition. The reason for his "woman suit" obsession is clearly motivated by masturbatory fantasy, not dysphoria. Buffalo Bill was nothing but a perverted man, and if you diagnosed him as trans while watching the movie then you might be contributing to this exact problem. This movie was a big deal to me growing up as I was raised by a TERF and previously didn't see a difference between trans people and perverts - maybe that's why it took me several years longer than it should have to come out, and even longer to start properly transitioning.
Thank you.
So, the hack who would be Freud, it seems. Building an unfalsifiable theory on a handful of case studies.
I dont ever wear a bra to sleep.  I dont feel like spending the money to replacing the things when they stretch out. : |
if i'm not on male hormones then why does my sexuality match more with the "male" side of the comparison chart?
Your channel is a prime example of how important conversation is. It seems to me that most conflict in the world is just misunderstanding. I wonder what someone who has experienced every life in history would be like.
I love the Gameranx narrator you've got there.
Oops i cant Subscribe twice😂
My early life was more boyish and I started medical transition last year. Until shortly before I concluded with having gender dysphoria, I lacked the attraction to women I was used to, and found a newfound desire for men. I don't get erotic pleasure from transitioning.
"I can make up Greek words too, Blanchard." 😂
That song was from a left 4 dead parody i saw.
*Googles "Bailey fucksaw incident"*  ... So this guy basically saw Top Secret and decided to mock up a real-life version of the Anal Intruder???
Bisexual man in an interracial relationship with a woman here.  I love your work.  Great video.  This is really nitpicky, but even Dr. Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs goes out of his way to prove that Buffalo Bill is not a transsexual but is a sadomasochist and the victim of childhood abuse.  He even points out that Buffalo Bill had been rejected on psychological grounds from 2 hospitals for gender reassignment surgery for this very reason.  Again, love your work; I'm just a cinephile who found you through Lindsey Ellis.
So everyone is gay. We are all gay.
I found you by accident but you have a driving passion to give your point of view with depth and lighthearted comedy. I will follow you on you tube from now on as you make so much sense.
I'd fuck me.
my aesthetic is watching ContraPoints lipsync to Baroque opera
"I dont want to be whistled at by the kind of person who whistles at me"  Even as a straight cisdude I relate to this, but that's only bc I assume any woman who likes me must be clinically insane.
I'm a cis-het woman, and your channel has talked more about sexuality experiences that mirror my own than any heteronormative media I've ever seen. The way female sexuality is usually depicted as either the asexual virginal model or an oversexed, visually-stimulated mirroring of male sexual arousal. The fact that I don't fit into either of these categories has always made me feel defective and confused. However, the way you described your sexual arousal patterns after you started transitioning sounds almost exactly like my own: clear sexual attraction, but rooted more in interpersonal situations than the biology and aesthetics of a partner. It feels good to hear someone call that normal instead of making it seem like I'm less of a modern woman for not needing to orgasm every damn day
I am apparently a TERF. Am not. I have watched as transsexual friends of mine have been held up as collateral for abusive and predatory males to use the umbrella trans and dodgy academic theory to justify abusive behaviour and their kinks. I discuss safeguarding and equality frameworks for women that are about abuse, and not how they identify but abusive male pattern behaviour. I have always drawn a distinction but am still targeted as a tef because I discuss law that existed long before this and womens inequality without concentrating on that identity. All this is discussion of internal identity. Male violence is extenal oppression and so are the laws. THis whole situation is revolting, its terrible for women, its terrible for transsexuals but the narcissistic rage around this activism only has one end. I liked your video very much btw you are very good on camera.
Wow.  Thank you so much. You have answered many questions that I could never have asked any trans people, because I'm not a complete arsehole. Thank you
18:12  > pause > rummage around for a clipboard > settle for notepad.exe  I love armchair psychoanalysis
I came here to expand my views (and did) and also got a Harry S. Plinkett reference.  Well done, ma'am.  Well done.
So... is it just me or is it Blanchard and Bailey more mentally ill than any of the people they’re writing about.....
This was absolutely incredible. Thank you so much for sharing all of your thoughts and your own personal experiences! I love your channel!!! Keep it up, girl.
People: trans is just a sexual fetish thing. Me: is asexual and trans
Wow, this... really hit home hard. :x
Myself I shall adore, if I persist in gay 🦄🦋
It's really really weird how much I could relate to the part of the video where you talk about your sexual history. I'm identifying as a cis woman now, but I grew up super androgynous and couldn't relate to other kids my gender. I spent my entire high school years presenting masculine, wearing kind of preppy, "gay" men's clothing and kept my hair shaved short. It helps that I have such a masculine body though-- tall, wide shoulders, narrow hips, visible adam's apple, BARELY filling out an A-cup... I was straight then and straight now, but was really only able to appeal to the men who were into "tomboys" (even though most were still embarrassed to be seen with me in public).   I loved being seen and treated as a man, but even more so feared the idea of being seen and treated as a woman. I deeply considered transitioning as an adult, but hesitated at the last minute and decided to try being a woman while I still had the chance.  I've studied it and asked around and I feel like I've gotten pretty good at being a woman. I just don't talk to very many women anyways and feel kind of out-of-place like this. I haven't been able to get any relevant advice about it yet either.
I love that you leave your laughing in after you say something with such serious expressions
Oh wow, I had no idea you were a Wildcat!
face it. youre just an attention whore crossdresser. i speak from experience.
I'm straight cis and male but in a hypothetical future where VR avatars feel real or I can control a synthetic human body tailored to my design, I would totally have at least one female version, probably multiple of different aesthetic and it would definitely turn me on. I don't think I'll ever bother cross-dressing because I'm not androgynous enough, but I do get turned on my my thighs in the mirror when my untucked shirt looks a bit like a dress and my socks like tights or stockings or whatever. Its not a massive fetish of mine or anything, just add it to the list...
This video kinda shocked me. As different as Contra’s experience is as a trans woman I also found myself identifying a lot with how she described the way her sexuality changed when she began transitioning. I guess I never really realised how attraction differs in a biosex male body.
Hey guys didja hear? The next model of gynephilia is gonna be automatic! Woohoo!
I literally get such a knot in my stomach listening to your videos and want to scream but only bc everything your saying is so rationally stated and logical. Your perspective is truly appreciated and felt on this end. Blessed be sis 🙏🏼
Woman, sleep in a bra, have a designated boobage pillow that I sleep with, I like the support. Also, my term for you is sexy. You do you and love it (I hope we can all get there)
i'd fuck you
YOU PLAY WELL BUT let's PLAY WITH EACH OTHER.
I GOT WHISTLED AT AND FOLLOWED BY GUYS ONE DAY, I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT BUT I WEAR LEATHER HEAD TO TOE AND WEAR MAKE-UP NOSFERATU LIKE, I GOT HIT ON, I MUST BE GOOD LOOKING I AM SO HARD TO SEE, GET TOGETHER ONE MORE TIME.
you are so well spoken
Let's START A TECHNO-HEAVY METAL BAND, I PLAY GUITAR AND SING, WE COULD MAKE MUZIK LIKE SEX
I GOT THIS BABYSITTER THEORY.
YOU ARE A VERY SEXY WOMAN.
I LOVE TRANSEXUaLS, IT DIFFUSES A LOT OF MYSTERY OF ATTRACTION. GNOSTICISM.
im a cis woman and i sleep with a bra on too! but thats just because im insecure about my droopy tits despite being 14 so i refuse to take it off unless absolutely necessary so idk if we can relate very much on that
When I started transitioning I felt that I was autog... cluster b at first, but after transitioning more than owning a single pair of thigh sock, most of that completely disappeared, and until I started hormone blockers I still had these feelings sometimes, but looking back, that was never my main reason for transitioning, it was mostly my hatred for my own body, and not hating my body, made me happy
It kind of baffles me that you have to (and I know you have to) adress cis people (I am a cis woman) in order for them to understand how difficult to bare your soul like that has to be. With all that is at stake. I am in awe of all of your work and have been binging your videos for the last few days. And well I was actually surprised you went this far. Because it must take a lot a lot of courage! So praise to you and thank you. I  have studied Julia Serano in philosophy class and have found her reasonings very insightful, as I am finding yours.  P.S. that thing about witches isn't really about depicting oneself as a hideous monster but more reclaiming a female knwoledge and wisdom that has been vilified by religion and patriarchy. I mean its simplified but that is more the gist of it as I understand it. Though of course its fun to impersonate someone deemed evil once in a while.
The category should be education
Hello! I'm a cis woman, and I first heard about this autogynephilia madness from my fiancee, who's a trans woman. I knew it was BS when she told me about the study revealing that the survey reliably flags cis women as autogynephiles. But I had no idea the guy who came up with the "theory" was *that* much of a creep. 😷 Thanks for the info. Also you're a huge cutie patootie. Hugs from Arkansas!
Nice Clockwork Orange reference mama contra <3
I’m a female - I have to come frequently, like if I don’t come for 3 days (that was a challenge) I start getting depressed and I lose all energy and vitality and I get so horny I get turned on by breathing, swallowing and flipping through book pages. - I am turned on by visual cues AND auditory cues AND someone I like touching me AND fantasies - I’m bisexual - And I have one main paraphillia the others come and go  I guess if you classified my sexuality it would be a kind of gender-neutral mess.
this channel is art
I want to date Natalie, but my name is also Natalie. It's not a problem for me if it's not for you. ❤
Thank you for sharing these amazing videos with us. Thank you, for you being you and for helping others to better understand both other people as well as themselves. You are a real gift to this world, I'm very glad that I found your channel.
While watching the video, I was so absorbed, and now that it is finished I remember close to nothing. I mean I probably can't recall most of the stuff you said, but I DO feel. I felt so many things, and feelings cannot be forgoten... These feelings shall lead me to become a better human being and give me the strength necessary to denounce all the inhuman ideas that have been put into my head while growning up. That was truly a Masterpiece.
People need to be more well-aware of this. You could totally write your own book on this.
This video is proof that the YouTube video essay is not only a brand new and amazing form, but the future we all need.   You're an inspiration as a thinker. As a creator. And as a person.
Wow.. 🙏🏻🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Thank You! Brilliant, informative and inspirational..... “as it clung to her thigh, how I started to cry, as I wanted to be dressed just the same.“ ☺️💖
I love Contrapoints. Super interesting and I haven't watched a vid without cracking up at least 3 times
What I want to know is why is it wrong to be in love with yourself or masterbate? Why is it a pathology to find yourself attractive? Seriously why is it that only cishet men are allowed to like sex and masterbation? It's ridiculous. It's not all about sex obviously, but why can't we like it and enjoy it without being accused of having a psychological disorder?
Thank you for giving so much of yourself. You are a beautiful woman and I'm so happy I found your Youtube. I wish you nothing but happiness. This was insightful and brilliant and honest.
Thanks so much for your bravery here. You're really making a big difference. My fiancee was getting all these Terf's spamming her facebook with anti-trans bullshit so I sat her down and showed a big marathon of your videos. You really changed her mind. You're just bloody fantastic. Love and respect, from Liverpool, UK.
For: Too long, Didnt Watch users; Men upset that they lust after women(trans or otherwise), so they blame women as the problem.
This is excellently informative (thank you for the education), and also I never in my life thought I would be encouraged to look up 'the f***saw incident.' I did.  Gosh.
It seems like all I need to do to write a bestselling psychology book is punch down, assume everyone is lying and make up a bunch of scary Greek words. So look out for my upcoming bestseller “Vroom Vroom I want you in my Womb: A study of Autobahnogyroandrometaphilia.” In which I make the claim that all women want to have sex with cars.
I knew it! Knew you liked RLM :D
I'm a cis guy but holy crap did this help me understand female sexuality so much more. This actually clears up a lot of internal questions I've had about my girlfriend and our relationship, and I can't describe how much that helps. I know that wasn't your aim, but thank you.
Your existence is so important 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Thank you so much for being so open about your experience. I was riveted from start to finish when you were describing your relationship with your body and your gender, i feel like i really learned something here. Its hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone whose brain doesnt work the same way yours does, and im so grateful to you for the insight. Just like how 'neurotypical' people don't understand my mental health issues on a personal, empathetic level, I have lovely trans friends whom I cant fully relate to on that physical level. Your videos are some of the highest quality content on YouTube, and I adore you. Youre beautiful and intelligent and so articulate, your voice draws me in. Big fan 💖
Anyone who supports psychoanalysis as their only theory of human behavior really needs to take psychology 101.  Also, as a psychology undergraduate and applying for clinical graduate school, I find your videos and perspective very interesting and informative to other ideas. Sadly, the field is still controlled by straight white men and our theories are still based around them. We need more of this in the field.
I'd like if we didnt have to hear any cis-het males perspectives on anything ever. This explains so much about general trans-phobia.
Wasn't the point of Buffalo Bill that he wasn't actually transexual, just a psychopath? I understand it's not good trans representation, but I remember Lector going out of his way to assert that Bill was not actually trans

Thank you for another immensely enlightening video.  You work is always so thoughtful, detailed, well researched, and thought provoking all while being genuinely entertaining as well.
You’re so pretty omg
god i love your videos. I'm a cis white straight guy and hearing your point of view and experience is so relatable and educational. I've just been binging your channel. You're my favorite youtuber
I'm sorry this video confuses me. are you saying that if they haven't built their own sex robot, then they aren't real trans women?
with gay guys with ultrafemenine elements that does transition and then turn that down because it wasn't their thing after all, how do they contribute to this discution?
Okay, so the truth is I always viewed you as a woman. The way you speak, present yourself to us and how you moved was always womanly to me but I thought I was just being annoying because of the crossdressing. For my trans friends, this can be said too. (exluding genderqueer or fluid people that I always felt an ambivalence from) I ask them if they find it offensive that I see them as cis, they have never been offended but Im still careful around it.    Point is, you're a cis to me. I hope it doesnt offend you. Its just that when I view your videos I have always felt the comfortability that I feel only with women. It's just a vibe I guess.    Anyway, proud of you.
This was brilliant and far too close to home. Even admitting that much fills me with embarrassment and some amount of shame. Therefore, from my perspective, this video is also incredibly brave. Thanks so much.
As a big old pervert myself, I can't imagine transitioning just to satisfy the kink. Like, that's so much to go through, and I ain't see anyone with this fetish making it past the first sign of trouble, no matter how big their perversion. Bed Time Sexy Fun ain't gonna push you to go the distance.  Like, you don't see Vore Fetishists breaking into Anaconda enclosures at the Zoos. And if you did, I'm sure you'd see them back the fuck down at the first bite.  And, of course, living your whole rest of your life as woman, just for your bedroom sexy time, is not worth.
"Sartorial Angst" - This. This is how I feel about almost all things.
Odd question: is that music in the intro (the electronica, not the opera) Romeo and Juliet?
I love you like I just want to live in an aesthetically wonderful world and wear amazing things and be woke and expressive ♥️♥️♥️
I'm sure somebody's probably brought this up before so I'm probably wrong but aren't Trans-people just people who have the hormone balance of the opposite of their original  birth gender? That during puberty their hormonal balance started to shift drastically from what their birth hormone balance was which a person's hormone balance does change as you age so I never that was odd interpretation of it. I have heard that hormone balances can lead to depression and suicidal tendencies so trans-people have to careful not to allow their hormones stay at a non-safe balance which is different for literally every single person. I don't know enough about what that balance should even be but I would assume certain doctors could help discern what that is. Obviously not one of these quacks that you were talking about in this video. Then again I do just refer to woman as inny's and men as outty's with no real difference between the two in my head. I believe that any difference is based on societal opinions more than any actual biological components but maybe that's just because I don't ever think of myself as being manly.  These two beliefs are kinda at odds with one another but I have no idea how to settle on one or the other. I probably shouldn't even try to pick one.
You playing the piano at the end made me cry, thank you ;_;
Why can’t all PEOPLE be as calm and rational and open about their experiences - when talking about anything - as Natalie?
43:04 had me dead
I learned a lot today thanks to this video. You rock, nothing like learning a wealth of information on a topic I had little to no knowledge about.  On a personal note: When I heard the term "soul" in this concept I discounted it immediately. Just me though. (hm, after looking it up I bit I could not find that exact wording, oh well, damage done)
Thank you for educating! As a gay man I’m fascinated by your experience and I really enjoy learning more about what trans people go through, especially hearing about it from you because you are such a good speaker and role model.
This was weird to watch cause my name is Bailey 😂
Jesus at 21:00 youve spelled out my feelings fuck
From a transwoman who started her transition a year ago and stopped, out of fear that she was just some deluded pervert, thank you.
There is at least two men out there, who just can't bear in mind that someone may want to be - as pityful creature of no opinion - as women. Only pervert would want that. After all - they didn't criticise, pardon - SCIENTIFICALLY RESEARCHED - transmen. BTW. all respects for your work. These insights about how hormones are changing humans/womens sexuality patterns are very precious. Now I can blame my high level of testosterone for drawers full of stockings and belts👌
So basically if you had fancy pseudo-Greek suffixes that will make you a deep academic?
Yet again according to many reactionaries like these, everyone who gets slightly antsy is a narcissist to the point where nowadays it’s lost as much as it’s meaning as “inconceivable”
It's weird because I miss the sound of your pre-transition singing voice, but also somehow it makes me happier to hear you sing as you.
Watching this helped me overcome a lot of repressed shit and feel more confident and less "gross" for being me. Thank you.
I do love your singing voice
A post op Trans friend of mine says she still suffers the occasional bout of GD. Let me know 20 years after you have SRS how your GD is going? I believe they think that those with Autogynephillia are almost always Trans Lesbians, how successful are they at dating? Like all truisms, this one isn't 100% I have read a few stories of trans women who were previously married and only attracted to women, after transition to at least go on a date with a man
The convoluted methods in which these "scientists" have to dance around explaining their findings just make my head hurt. Thank you so much for making this, I found it very interesting, and hope it will help me eloquently counter anyone who has this intensely skewed point of view. Thankfully I generally socialize with fairly broad minded and well informed people.
Is that Louis C. K.?  What's that from?    Keep killin' it, Natalie.
This is the best explanation of transwomanhood I have ever seen. Your thinking is very clear and your philosophical training shows.
great video!
love you, you're super sweet have a lovely day and enjoy your day
Gnoblin
I'm so glad i watched this. I'm a translesbian, although i never use that term in public, i watched with interest the section where you talk about yourself and became quite emotional. You made me feel more at ease than two years of gender therapy. Lately TERFs and just general doubts had me questioning my transition but this video showed me that i am valid.   Not desiring men seems to be a red flag to some clinicians but your phrase "It's not a story about wanting a man, it's about being wanted by a man. [...] i resonate with the wish to be wanted."  Thank you so much. It's not wrong to want to be treasured, even if they are not your sexual preference. I think you're beautiful and utterly fascinating.
You're amazing
I’m a far left straight white male with dashing good looks however, I am hopelessly shy and unable to approach women. I’ve had women approach me but I get scared and become distant. As a severely depressed hypochondriac tormented by anxiety over the most mundane situations, it wouldn’t be much of a surprise that I’m a virgin. Contrary to a lot of people in a similar situation, I am not in much of a hurry to lose my virginity and haven’t had much of a sexual libido perhaps as a result of the copious amounts of anti depressants I take to dissuade me from slitting my wrists. I even thought myself asexual for a time. I’ve found that i have a sub kink which isn’t often acceptable for males in our society. I honestly don’t care much about sex rather, I just want to feel wanted by another human being. I honestly don’t know why I’m asking for advice in a YouTube comment section but I really enjoy this community and feel it may be accepting of me.
This video should really be shown in women's studies and sex ed
Can anyone tell me which track plays for the subheadings by Zoe? I really like it but am struggling to find it on their bandcamp.
Ya’ll ever just drink straight Irish creme
With each video I love you more, but at the same time I fear you more.....
Hey Natalie, although I'm grateful you did this video and believe that a lot of your audience gained new perspective, I hope that it didn't come at the price of your privacy and dignity. I don't believe that it's necessary for you to subject yourself to personal ridicule or an inquisition about your identity in order to make a convincing critique of any contemporary issue in academia (even those which affect you personally). Pouring your heart to millions of strangers on the internet for the purpose of proving a point may seem noble to some, but I think it's unfair to ask you, or anyone for that matter, to have to expose deep wounds to potentially bad actors for the sake of highlighting the dehumanizing nature of Blanchard's framework. I think you would've been able to make a lot of the claims you made in this video without necessarily going into the intimate details about your own personal experience (unless it felt therapeutic or liberating for you).  I know we live in the "aesthetic" and "radical sincerity" internet age, but save those stories for those who truly care about you. You don't deserve the pain that can come from making yourself vulnerable like that.  PS: I love you.
19:04
So he thinks being a trans woman is easier than to be a gay boy in society? And that it's easier for a trans woman to get dick than a gay boy? I'm gonna say no to that lol
Thank you for doing this video! And with such commitment. I used to suspect myself of autogynephilia, of course, why not? Also when I was a teenager the only kind of explanations that was to be found on the internet were low-class out-fashioned psychoanalysis simplifications on "psychology" websites, poor me, haha.
I am showing this video to a social work theory class this week. Thank you for all you do!
Brava!   that  took courage,  99% + of the people of all stripes watching this video would find it  impossible to be so open, to be honest and revealing of their own sexual identity complete with each little kink of its development...we are all so terrified of being judged, then perhaps rejected, details about our past and present orientation or behavior used to mock us.   I am filled with admiration  of your courage and freedom about this.     thanks for giving us straights such insight into your journey...insight leads to empathy, empathy leads to acceptance.     Just sayin this old cis-guy accepts you as a sister.
You sound somewhere on the asexual spectrum....
Masterpiece.
Been working my way through a lot of your videos over the past month or so after discovering you through the "how to recognize a fascist" video. I'm just a cis straight dude who can't figure out if he's aesexual or not, but your videos have opened up a whole new excellent side of YouTube for me, and I thank you dearly for it. Keep being awesome, Natalie. You're great. :)
Problem with the social sciences and especially the laymen interpretation of the social sciences.  The human psyche is extremely complex and varied.  The scientific approach to understanding the complex and varied is to split it into digestible segments that will hopefully when put together explain a greater whole.  Issue comes in when researchers ascribe greater significance to their research than is warranted and then academics and laymen alike proceed to draw conclusions well beyond the scope of that research.
hi, I am a cis woman who used Rocky Horror/dressing up as Frank N Furter to try out goth hard femme fashion in a safe environment when I was in high school, like 14-16. I'm also gay and RHPS showings were the one Queer Thing I could attend without question back then. TERFs can galaxy brain about trans women interacting with  p r o b l e m a t i c  media all they want but everyone is all just out here exploring identities/presentation and that does not make anyone an autogynephile.
Peter Coffin's narration was really bad. I get that he was trying to mock Bailey, but it just comes across as childish and was really unpleasant to listen to. It was in stark contrast with your well reasoned tone were you are also talking to the people that might believe those claims.
I've read plenty of hentai doujins in my life. But the fuck-saw incident is up there.
Anyone who is interested about BDSM sex, throw away that 50 Shades of Gray book. Read instead "Story of O" by Pauline Réage.
your dysphoria was socially induced. would you agree with this statement?
That was a really interesting and informative video. And this will sound creepy but your smile at the end when you were playing just cheered up me so much.
I have to stop you here over Blanchard.  OK, there is the French way of pronouncing it, and there is the American, most commonly Louisiana way of pronouncing it.  You pronounced it wrong in both respects.  I'm assuming he's from N. America due to being named Ray.  Here, it is pronounced Blan (like you are saying it) -Churd.  Blan-Churd, and with the stress on the first syllable.  Seriously, this is kind of like a name in my family, so . . . I hate to be one of those people, but . . . BLAN-churd.
I dig that squanky music at the start
Sure, I may be a straight cis guy, but Fifty Shades is still fucking trash. And it's porn. Why did we all just decide it's not porn?  Legit though fuck those books they're shoddily written.
Brava!
As a cis woman I can tell you I get more turned on by dressing up in a sexy way than by seeing male bodies or genitalia. I love feeling sexy. I guess that makes me a bit autogynephilic.  I am a bisexual who is currently more attracted to men than to women (it changes all the time) and in a heterosexual relationship.  And I don't think I'm sexually attracted to myself at all, I just like feeling sexy. It makes me feel powerful. So yeah that theory sounds like bullshit to me. I hope it gets smashed to pieces thanks to your video.
Just a little note on the hormones thing. So that is why men are attracted to people in a more objective way, and women are more attracted to people in an emotional way? I know I'm attracted to personalities rather than bodies, and my boyfriend, though very attracted to my personality, gets turned on by any 'hot body' really.  I was wondering how much this is a male-female thing and how much of it is social conditioning.
I hope you have fallen a bit more in love with yourself since you posted this.
How would all of this have played out in a mirrorless world?  In a world where we are not familiar with the image drawn to us?  Beyond the reproductive "truth" of maleness and femaleness, only hormonal correlates to guide an emotional profile, a character, only a character to guide our early selection of the roles and norms we see, interpret and reconstruct in ourselves as we can.  The imperative cast by these roles is, in some way, dehumanizing.  I am, in some way, torn apart by sadness, sympathy, anger and resentment for peoples' willful rejection of the chase for real freedom.  The humans' open dedication to their unconscious puppeteer's strings fills me up with uncryable tears of loneliness.   Your nature is not to hunt and fight. Your nature is not to love and care.  Your nature is to watch what you see and replay what you feel until you master your game and it's rules master you. Punish every failure.  They hold guns to your head. They push you out of windows. Cut off parts of you. Make you prey for monsters.   I used to highly respect transgender people for symbolically transcending their will over nature, overcoming innocence. But while their situation certainly confronts them with truths others might never have to look for, they never overcame their game. They reject freedom served on a silver platter. Lay their hands and feet into the strings of the puppeteer.  Leave me behind alone in this Truman Show.
alright 30 minutes in and idk my gender sexuality or name anymore
I'm inclined to believe this dude as i dont think ive ever seen a couple that wasnt two people essentially trying to date themselves but that nice little rundown of your sex life explained a lot
Oh my god. They tried to science the children of the moon XD
Thank you 🌺, your on going thoughtful Inquiry and research is so useful-helpful🙏🏼 and I hope your creative unfoldment brings you some deep satisfaction 🙏🏼
There isn't puppy heaven?? I love you ContraPoints!
My sister is cisgender and sleeps in a bra.
"If you even still have a family." This makes me sad. And angry. And sad again.
what about transvestic fetishism? or am i still just some egg in denial?
Wait, this theory is by the same guy who caused the *fucksaw incident*??? How is he even taken seriously as an academic when he's so very clearly airing his own fetishes in public while simultaneously denying it? His writing sounds like Freud, who's widely considered a hack - historically significant, but a total hack.
i love how [[brandishes riding crop]] is in the captions
Someone needs to to an in-depth study comparing trans women to gay men in every possible way so that we can finally get to the bottom of the transgender question.
To be fair I could see trans women as being very feminine men that find straight men attractive. I have have even spoken to transsexuals that admit they want SRS for sexual reasons. Also to be honest wanting SRS for sexual reasons makes more sense than wanting to chop of a body part because you don’t like it. However I don’t believe it’s Purely sexual reasons that trans women seek to look more feminine. For example I don’t go to the gym to look more masculine for sexual reasons, I do it to improve myself. So I imagine many trans women don’t try to look more feminine just for sex. Especially since I have met trans women that aren’t very interested in sex, although those ones went overly keen to get SRS.
I just watched your video about pronouns before this, and it's been the most helpful insight to trans people and their identities I think I've ever come across. I consider myself an ally, always have, but there was a part of trans communities I never quite grasped because, low and behold, I'm a stinky cis. But your videos, and your perspective aS a TrAnS wOmAN, have been super helpful in understanding gender better. Thank you so much for the information you put out, it's made me a better ally already.
i <3 u
Wait wait wait....dogs, DON’T go to heaven??? 😮😢😖😡🤬   >>> tRAhPs IS gA E e EEE!!!!
"its really more of a hospital gown" REALLY  got me
I'm a cis female and I think I do have some autogynephilic aspects to my sexuality. It's not the only aspect, but it's one of them — I DO get turned on sometimes looking in the mirror, especially when I'm all dolled up and can feel good about myself, and I like touching and playing with my own breasts. To get really in-depth and personal, I've even spanked myself, but that was with my partner and at their request.  I think the root of this is that even as someone who was born female, I don't always feel 'feminine' in my day-to-day, but I like to. When I'm wearing trainers, jeans and a T-shirt I don't necessarily think to myself 'I'm so hot' and I don't generally wear make-up or heels. So on the rare occasions that I do, it's almost like cross-dressing from my default state of being to one of ultrafemininity, to sexiness. I relate to what you said about the cis woman who buys sexy lingerie not for men, but for herself. I do that too. It turns me on to wear sexy lingerie under my normal clothes even if I'm single and no one is going to see it. This is the same reason I sometimes shave my legs/pussy even when single and going through a dry spell. It just makes me feel sexier and is that not autogynephilia?  My point is, even if some trans women do experience autogynephilia, why/how would this devalue their experiences as women? I think this is normal even among cis women — again, maybe not for all, but definitely at least for some — I'm living proof. And this doesn't mean that I don't also like to fuck other people, or that I'm in love with myself. I just like to feel/look good and it's not enough to know that other people would fuck me, I want to know that I /deserve/ to be fucked, if that makes sense. I want to know that I would fuck me, because being able to meet my own high standards means I'm also capable of meeting the high standards of other people who are in high demand because they're desirable.
Great video, very informative and well argued.
it doesn't matter whether it's 'twisted'. What matters is whether it's true - even if only for a few. There are people on YT who say they are autogynephiles who are attracted to women only, and are not, and have never been, homosexual transsexuals.
that Baroque turn at the end of your song lmao I LIVE
yay now i know im definetely an autophilic :D
and 50sog is just the shitty romanticized-abuse and misinformed-about-BDSM side of erotic fiction aimed at women. if you get into actually GOOD fiction it's a whole new ball game. I do find it fascinating that women in general are far more stimulated by written smut than pictures or video. honestly though you don't know satisfying solo orgasms until you've read a slow burn fanfic where the main characters have their first sexual encounter after 30 chapters of heart-wrenching character development and compelling worldbuilding
Also came I gotta kind lesbian romance novels I need to get in on that stuff it sounds so hot. The goal is to marry up and help ppl but failing that i`'ll take getting a gf
As a nb asfab lesbian psychologist, I feel you SO HARD psychology as a field needs all the old straight white men OUT. Also babe I don`t wanna be like ugh annoying but you`ve exhibited lots of signs of autism in your vids and you might know this idk if you do or not but I have autism too so I tonice it in other ppl
Like i`m nb but my anxiety is so bad it makes me doubt every aspect of my identity I hate it and my mom is cis the she doesn`t understand she`s also straight like she doesn't understand my lesbianism like she empathises but doesn't understand
Like ,y dysphoroac is like made worse by my mental illness i t SUCLS SO MUCH OMG THI S THEORY SUUUUCKS
I relate to your dyspepsia so much oh my god
Hey, "Cluster B" refers to a set of Axis II personality disorders, including narcissism, histrionics, borderline, etc.  <3
I'm a cisgender woman and your vids help me understand transsexuality a bit better... There are still alot of things I don't get or don't know which opinion to hava about it, but you showed me that there are transpeople, that aren't left extrimist that just shout nonsense... Thanks for being this open, sexuality should be something we all can dicuse
im a cis women who wears corsets and fishnets and garterbelts. women can wear what they want. all women.
I've been slowly going through your videos, mostly cause your observations on lots of topics make me sit back and think about them or start researching, because they're really great and I ended up on this one. The more you talked about your experiences in learning about what you want to dress like and learning about female fashion made me start actually thinking about this to me, especially with your comparisons of getting male hormones out so the paraphillic desire goes away, and your own experiences (Like the sleep-bra thing, I've been there, I didn't get it!), it just felt like you were ticking on a checklist and suddenly I was crying. I've never really been able to muster up courage to talk to people about my feelings in this matter because of my family environment, and sometime somewhere I learned of autogynephilia and since I never talked to anyone about how I felt, Its been kind of lurking as a half-memory somewhere. I'd really like to thank you for helping me learn about this nonsense theory a lot more. I've resolved to make 2019 a bit better for me, and start looking into my gender more.
Very enlightening. This is something I really knew nothing about nor, frankly, did I have much interest. Transvestite? Transsexual? Drag? The same thing? One leads to the other? How is it not gay? As I said, no idea, so thanks, this is an enormous amount of information.   We have a Terf vs Trans conflict brewing over an upcoming RadFem event at the public library. At least you've given me a glimmer of insight.  This isn't my first video of yours. I stumbled upon your stuff.  Honestly in the first video I saw of yours, until you mentioned you were trans, I thought you were a natural born woman with great lighting.
physically inept    same
thx now i know what a fucksaw is
yhay transphobia
I want to hug her so bad
Oh my absolute heroin. Thank you for giving so much of your vulnerability for the greater good. And oh, you're smashing <3 !!
I LOVE YOU
Girl, you're helping to get over my cis-male transphobia. Thank you for bravery and honesty. I am loyal to my Queen, Contrapoints!!!!
Thanks for making this its been really illuminating
I know I'm late to the party (only discovered ContraPoints a few weeks ago) but I found it really interesting that a mtf trans person's sexual attraction changes during transition. I always hear pastors say that men are just soo much more visual than women, and that's why they suffer from more sexual temptation, but I was like, "how are you to know? What if men were just more expressive of their sexual desire?"   However, as I (a cis woman) have stepped into the dating world, I've found myself mystified by my own inability to determine attraction by physical features alone, for example in a Tinder profile. So, Natalie's experience of needing an interpersonal connection to experience attraction, as a woman, makes me feel valid.   Although I recognize this is just the experience of one transsexual -- I'd be curious to see if mtf trans people have inverse changes in sexual desire.
Gender fluid pansexual here. I accept you unconditionally. You take on so much scrutiny about extremely personal things. You are helping to lay the foundation for acceptance by actively challenging people's long held stigmas about trans women. I believe everyone has a right to a peaceful existence. You're helping to make that happen.
Just saying, but 50 Shades of Grey is a pretty mysogynistic book... But I'm sure you already knew that
You are amazing! Thank you for your honesty...it has opened my mind to things I could never have imagined...this was incredibly brave...
As a hetero female, no such thing as normal sexuality or normal gender identity. I just feel some things and have some needs and I want to fulfill those needs and I don't want people to judge me for my feelings and my needs. And yeah, as long as we're not really harming anyone, why do we need to bother to put ourselves in boxes and follow the norms, whatever those fucking norms are. Maybe it's just discovery and self discovery and it's a journey that may have one stop or many stops or never stops.
Thanks for saying that people who are autogynephilic aren't somehow weird or wrong. As someone with a body swap and gender swap fetish who is a CIS Male with OCD one of the things that causes my great anxiety is that because I have this fetish that I'm actually a closeted transexual. Not to say that being trans is a bad thing but it's not me and it makes me feel uncomfortable and it doesn't help that a lot of trans communities online see that fetish as a sign of transexual.  It's not the idea of being seen as female version of myself doing every day tasks that turns me on but the idea of being a hot woman being treated as a female sexually and having a female body sexually that turns me on which I think is the primary difference between being trans and it just being a fetish.  I'm also curious as to what it's like to be a woman but more out of the idea that it's something I'm not and something I'll personally never experience not out of feeling like a woman.  Also the idea of having boobs, periods, etc sounds real annoying.
Your videos are incredibly good. You are an amazing explainer, you seem very educated and use your language in a way that makes difficult concepts very clear and easy to understand. I also appreciate your openness about things that are usually treated as a taboo while they really shouldn't be. And lastly, I love your lighting, your editing, your script and the structure of your videos which keep my attention so well that I don't have a problem with watching a 50 minute long video on YouTube. Thanks for your contributions and you are definitely a new favourite
I really liked hearing your story, I really appreciate you for sharing it with the world.
Wait, sex drive isn't supposed to feel like filthy demonic possession or addiction? That... explains a lot.
Please Marry me, I'm in love!
thank God for this video. Contra has perfectly described (in reverse) my own feelings about my sexuality and gender as a transgender man. On the flip side, this video also made me notice a newer trend in transphobic theory.  Versions of this theory have been applied to trans men as our visibility has increased. The two types of transgender "men" are the yaoi loving self obsessed straight girls and the oppressed manipulated self loathing lesbians. Of course, no such theory has been published, for mainstream transphobia would need to acknowledge our existance first, but those two archetypes are the go to models of trangender men.   Someone else can finish that analysis. I'm too tired of it to think about it too hard.
I'm late to the party but my cis boyfriend has been watching you for a long time now and directed me, a transgender man, to your channel and dammit girl, you're a gem. I've been living as a man for three years now, I've lost everything over it and gained quite a bit too, hormones have been a godsend (now if I could just save enough for those pesky surgeries!) but even still, it is EXHAUSTING explaining the same personal details about 'the trans experience' and I appreciate that you could do so so early on as I was an outspoken, easily offended little prick when I came out to my Baptist family at 23 years old. I'm  26 now and living the dream. Keep that shapely chin up, sugar, we need goddesses like you in this world.
i wonder what the sex robot looks like.  and i hope i didnt comment this when i originally watched the video, because then it would look like i am 2-comments-worth concerned with sex robots, and really i'm just 1 comments-worth concerned but have a bad memory,
Wow, thank you, this video should be shown as part of a class on gender and transgender talks and studies. Great Job Natalie, you're awesome.
More and more studies points to the transsexual brain looks more like the opposite sex’s brains. It’s implied that the condition is bio neurological in nature. There’s causation. So the notion that it’s a man trapped in a female body or a woman trapped in a male body might actually be true. More research needed, but there’s strong indications. https://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-05/esoe-tba051818.php
W E L L. As a cis female I expected to only gain a better understanding of Transwomen. Not my own sexuality too! Suddenly I feel fuckin great and fuckin educated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ql1mhn8WbI4 Why do you always have to suppress your voice Is everything you do an act?
6:45
what is the opera in the beginning?
This is such a good video thank you so much!
The rocky horror interlude made me choke on my orange juice
PROBLAMATIC
I read that book when I was a young pre-transition trans boy for an essay I was writing in high school. Funnily enough, I don't remember anything from that book at all other than the word "autogynephilia" because similar to you, I was basically completely unsexual as a teenager (beyond some steamy ass boy band roleplay on online forums) and didn't fully register what I was reading. Regardless, thank you for talking about it. It's so insane to me that almost every piece of literature I read about trans people just 10 years ago was written by a cisperson who had somehow managed to seek out the most openly sexual transwomen possible for their research. That's probably exactly how these stereotypes came to be formed in the first place.
But why are cluster B less attractive?
I could literally listen to you speak for hours and I am cheekbone deep in a crush on you. Your my new favorite “YouTuber”
I'm a cisgender male who didn't know much about all these transexual experiences, but thanks to this channel now I'm willing to know more and now I believe as a society we really need to learn more about the trans community, so they don't have to hide in the shadows. The work here presented is not only brilliant but necessary as mainstream media are not willing to educate about this topic in a humanistic, scientific and objective way. But there's valuable content here, and I love it.
"more women are into feminizing boys" can u do a video on this please omg
Seriously glad that you did this video. You've made my view of transsexual women considerably more nuanced than it was before and I really wanna thank you for that ^^
25:40 I was going to say that the sexual terms and characteristics attributed to trans women would apply broadly to most populations unless some groups were allowed to opt out of the clinic due to their privacy not being on display.
You are incredibly smart.   Just found your channel and LOVE IT....
I was recommended to watch your channel by a Spanish friend and have been binge watching ever since. I love you Contrapoints! What a shame that so few other YouTube channels can broadcast arguments rather than opinions with no evidence or reasoning. Such a badass! So much work goes into these videos clearly and they are all so insightful, really useful as I wanted to educate myself xxx
i love this bitch <3
I respect your expression as a woman honestly but you can’t actually know what it’s like to be a woman since you’re genetically exclusively male. You can only imagine you know what a female feels like since some sense in you tells you so. Trans womanhood is imaginary. It may be a form of humanity but nevertheless it is a subjective state of being rather than having an objective center of operation. Trans people are not going to heaven as trans. You may not perceive what God made you - heck neither do I. But the created is perfected in God only. I’m sure God wants us to be comfortable so transitioning is potentially a valid treatment. But I think we have to try and follow God as much as possible by finding fulfillment in virtue and without deliberately sinning. I encourage you to think about your place in God’s Kingdom before relying solely on your place in the LGBTQ community.
Honey I feel your position on trans types but the question is not why are you trans. The question is why did you have gender dysphoria to begin with? Because the supposition is that your maleness should have been sufficient but it wasn’t. You needed to have femaleness. And the question is why?
I am cis woman and I have always worn a bra to bed since like 14. Granted I have small tits so the bra doesn’t dig in or bother me.
this might sound stupid, but your personal testimony just looks so logical. it's a perfectly legitimate reason to be a woman. you wanted comfort. you knew it was doable this way, so you did that. it's greatly simple.
The Virgin autogynephilia vs the Chad Autophallophobia
Im a 19 yo cis woman who knows very little about the trans community as it has been a topic that has been ignored or denied from the cultural background ive been brought up in (cough cough asian) anyway im thankful to the yt recommendation for once to recommend me your videos. I love your content and your perspective on topics. Just thought id leave this comment saying i really appreciate what you create and thanks to you i can clear out some misconceptions about trans community and treat them with respect in our society
Can't wait to send this to my egg friend who keeps claiming "im just AGP bro"
15:30-15:50 so you think you are a woman from the inside but you don't think you are a woman on the inside. What's up with that?
Never heard of Blanchard but he sounds like a total duche
I've never really understood transexuals until now, and I couldn't be happier about it. I kind of love you 👄
Your suffering is comic - like "Jackass" for emotional cripples. You're a totally fuckable Babe as a man or a womanish man. Stop the hormones and mutiliation. The nose is great. Ask Detox. You need nothing more. Well, maybe dance lessons. You move with constraint.
You're amazing!
"It takes time to develop an authentic sense of female fashion. What did you wear when you were 14?" //WAKE ME UP INSIDE!//  OMG! I died! This video is one of my favorites! So many excellent points. Though I am a straight trans woman, I can't think of anywhere else such nuances of my sexuality are so accurately described. Brava!
and wait til you see my sex robot!
Long shot, but I really love how cohesively you construct your arguments. Is there anyway you could speak on your research and writing process?
Yo, I’m a cis woman who wears a bra to bed, because my breasts are heavy enough to hurt my back and chest if I don’t
If Blanchard’s typology has inspired such thoughtful analysis then it is a good thing
Amazing. Really smart shit.
Thank you so so so much
As a trans woman with a fetish for homosexual men I was actually sexually happier pretending to be a gay man, but outside of bed I knew I was miserable and just pretending CAUSE I AM ACTUALLY A GIRL OK. Idk what this authors on about lol Im not attracted to femininity at all LIKE AT ALL
Thanks very much, good to hear from someone like yourself, whom knows the reality of, verse theorizing.
The idea of someone claiming to be a ~objective~ scientifically pure psychologist is a little out there in the first place. There's a reason that area is known as a "soft science" alright.
~ p r o b l e m a t i c ~
What the fuck is contemporary (chrystal? (29:59)
I like you so much
A weird thing about his theory to me as a nonbinary person, is that for me accepting that I already objectively was attractive was what helped me accept and realize my identity. I didn't understand my dysphoria and that it was related to my gender. Growing up I translated my unwell feelings towards my body as that I was unattractive. Having breasts and bigger hips turned into "I'm fat" and so on. Eventually acknowledging that I was objectively attractive allowed me to further explore my feelings. For example it's not my body fat that upset me, but rather how it distributed giving me a ""female silhouette"".  Lol this turned out really long but really love your videos 💗
You know it's a great video when half the comments quote it but almost none of them quote the same line.
This might sound weird, but this video helped me to understand my girlfriend in a better way. I always thought our sexuality was identical in some way. Ty dude this wasnt just interesting to a regular cis guy, but really usefull relationship-advice. Facinating stuff
so how would you categorize someone that believes they may be trans that idealizes being female but still having a penis and penetrating women with it. and while i'm not into guys imagery of trans women with dicks dominating men is strangely appealing. perhaps what i crave is feeling like both genders at the same time?
All these made up Greek words are making my head hurt.
I know I'm way behind the times here, but just wanted to say that, as a cis woman, I have felt many of the things you describe here. Not saying that a trans woman's experience needs to correlate to a cis woman's to be valid, but just want to offer that to anyone who likes to argue that trans women have experiences that no cis woman could ever have. Also I have like four corsets in my wardrobe right now and use to wear a bra to sleep in high school, so I guess I've been doing femininity wrong for some time now.
She described how I feel sexually and what I am actually attracted to as a woman better than I ever could and she's new to the game. God bless
You are honestly one of the best communicators I've seen. I got all teary eyed at the end there (I'm a sucker for honesty). As a straight cis male and a radical leftist, I realised that I wasn't giving enough attention to LGBTQ+ social movements after making friends with more LGBTQ+ people. I wasn't prejudiced or anything (or maybe I was, being that I didn't give the issues being discussed by people in that community the same amount of attention as I give other social movements, but not overtly or consciously so) but I only really got to the point in which I said "well, I need to actually understand this better" after I wrote an article criticising some postmodern tropes that can be used by counterrevolutionaries. It wasn't a TERF type of thing and I didn't say that LGBTQ+ problems were secondary or that transsexual rights were interfering with anything in the woman's/worker's struggle, nor did I believed they were, but I felt like I was being way too shallow with my analysis. You've certainly given me a lot to think about with your videos and I'll read and watch a lot more on those subjects, so thank you very very much.
TBH, I might be autogynephilic; I enjoy the thought of looking in the mirror and seeing something sexy, as well as having more regular, promiscuous sex, and these thoughts are making me consider transitioning. But I know better than to assume the motivations of all trans people on that basis. I do, however, disapprove of you using the term 'pervert' to describe that one trans woman. Relatively speaking, you're not wrong, but the term is loaded with judgement and condemnation. Is she really hurting anybody with her sexual pursuits? Would I be? I don't think so, but please correct me if I'm wrong.
Brave, insightful and funny. Well done.
Natürlich zählen auch diese Trans Menschen, welche sexuell motiviert sind, zu denen mit einer Identitätsstörung! Meine Meinung. Habe diesbezüglich einige kennen lernen dürfen. Und mal ehrlich, welcher Trans Mensch ist nicht angetan wenn sie/er in den Spiegel schaut und mit ihrer/seiner Weiblichkeit konfrontoert ist!? Und ausserdem, was heisst sexuelle Motivation? Es ist doch auch eine sexuelle Motivation z.B. als Trans Frau die sexuelle Phantasie zu haben, mit einem Mann sexuell aktiv zu sein! Wenn das mal keine Motivation ist das Geschlecht zu wechseln, zu mindest eine von vielen! ;-)
Fantastic video Natalie: I want to add some warm jibberish, extensive research in brain structure and patterns of activation have shown strong correlation of teenager pre-transition trans women and cis women. Also twins tend to transition more than one would expect if it were not a biological condition. So while it might not be the only factor and while there might be more than one way of being trans, the evidence points in one direction, trans people have a biological condition.
Hats off to you for the courage to really share yourself.  It will help give others the courage to do the same and that's a good thing because that's what's ultimately going to win hearts and minds.  While I was with you from the start on most things, you've already managed to change mind my for the better on some smaller points by way of these videos.  They're crazy entertaining and so enriching without ever being condescending.  Great Piano playing on Time Warp at the end of the video.  That second ending was hella nice.
I ❤️ you. You’re my favorite.
Oh also, who is the beautiful opera singer featured in the video?
This is such a good video, as usual. I admit I did buy into the whole Blanchard theory (generally), and I could see it also in trans men - there were cluster A types (obvious tomboys, lesbians etc) and cluster B types (usually into gay men and seemed to want to be a gay man to attract them). However you do a really good job of explaining how those things fit in with cis sexuality. I really resonated with your experiences where you spoke about our sexual history. I have not transitioned and don’t think I will, but I do experience gender dysphoria (I am female). Some of it is just the general, wanting to dress as a man, and just be seen as a man socially and that kind of stuff. But some of it is sexual.And the few people I tried to explain it to (it did not go well) did revolve around this aspects of female sexuality you describe so well, which I HATE and can’t properly relate to. I think I’m average looking, but I can’t bear looking at myself in he mirror or looking at my own body. But I really feel, in order to have sex as a woman, you have to want to be “desired” as a woman, and seeing the desire you inspire in men is the thing that turns you on, more than just looking at men in an objective way. But I feel if you’re a woman who can’t properly resonate with that - you don’t feel desirable - and that could be more many reasons - it’s really hard to enjoy sex. Whereas you see men who look like absolute shit, and you can tell they don’t have this at all. My sexual fantasies always involve men in an abstract way. I hate heterosexual porn or anything like that. Some of it actually makes me sick. If I took Male hormones I expect I would probably feel more comfortable with my own sexuality. But there’s a whole lot of other reasons why I don’t feel up for doing that.  Anyway thanks for the vid and thanks for sharing, it’s really helped me to clarify my own thoughts on some things and nice to hear someone else giving a voice to certain things I’ve experienced which I didn’t know anyone else did.
the phrase "autogynephilic harry plinkett" will never leave my fucking head for the rest of my life. I hate you so god damn much
Professional dominatrix for 10 years here. I have MANY clients who are into sissification or crossdressing; in fact I would say I specialize in it among other things. They live overwhelmingly "straight archetype", jockbro lives and associate sissification with humiliation, and tend to do a lot of coke and have "interracial" "kinks" (aka ~big black cocks~ are a crucial figure in their lives, which yes I agree is racist and I don't push those kinds of fantasies). I have dated multiple trans women and also multiple twinky little femboys, and neither of these types overlap with the kind of guys who do binge-purge pattern autogynephilia kink stuff.
No theory is really falsifiable
First: Thanks a lot! you are brilliant!  Second: Are you familiar with the recent research on sexual desire (not behavior) by Ogas and Gaddam? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-A8GvUehq4 It's so on spot!
Ironically, I think I may be autogynophillic. As a trans man. I sexualise aspects of my own femininity to come to terms with dysphoria. My primary reasons for not wanting surgical procedures are that even if my social dysphoria would be alleviated by it,  I would miss the sexual use of them. Going on testosterone, funny enough, didn't have much of an effect on my levels of paraphillia and visual orientation... Actually I might be kind of more interested in non visual stimulus now. This might be because, however, I'm a rampant sex freak pervert who used to be in pain from uncomfortable arousal levels, as a dfab, on birth control, off birth, on depressants, off depressants, like... There wasn't really much higher my sex drive could go. The main difference is that it's definitely easier to orgasm. I can get lazer focused on it.... But that second part was true before testosterone as well. It can make it feel somewhat more urgent in the moment though, but still not outside of what I experienced before hormones. Or even before puberty. But trans men aren't real to researchers like this because they're obsessed with dick lol
l m a o thanks Contrapoints you've only confirmed AGP exists. Every argument made in this whole video or in the Julia serano article boils down to #NotAllTranswomen. Ok so Blanchard's kind of an ass and the dichotomy is false but like... a lot of transwomen started out with a feminization fetish. You yourself admitted a major part of your womanhood is wanting to be fucked and your idea of female desire is straight out of 50 shades of grey
I seriously love you, not only are you sooo smart and well spoken but your honesty is refreshing and you have such a charming way of being the realest person here
8:10 wow, i thought i was horny online
One of your best videos. Watched multiple times.  Also, you need to sing more.
Made this account just to say that you look super fucking cute in this video. @ me anytime ;)
Ok, dumb thing to comment on, but I, a cis woman (I think... I believe in the androgyny of the soul and I'll explain more of why I might not be considered cis), used to sleep in a bra all the time. When I was in high school, it might have been out of the same kind of sense of my body is changing and this particular sartorial garment provides a sense of security or maybe direction about where that journey is heading. I wore them in the military because I often had to be up at a moment's notice and it was easier to deal with. Sometimes I still do sleep in bras out of choice, usually what I call a sleep bra, but is non wired, thin fabric with some useless lacey bits. This is honestly just because I'm well endowed and I have accidentally rolled on them before and that just sucks - so sometimes I feel more comfortable if they are mildly contained. As you said, it's really for the comfort they provide and I don't wear them when they are uncomfortable. My main point with disagreeing with you on that is only that I don't think that's something that differentiates transwomen from ciswomen. That being said, I guess I'm nonconforming anyway and I identify as queer and demiromantic, so even though I was born a woman and I don't experience gender dysphoria, I don't always feel like a woman and, for a while, I thought there were some ways that I was more male, which I have evolved to understand was my demiromantic side talking - I wanted sex, not romance and in my young, simple mind that equated to male. Untangling biology and society, I find, is pretty difficult. I'm probably something like biologically 90% hetero, but find women more aesthetically pleasing even though they aren't, generally, sexually arousing. And that's sort of changing for me, which is welcome. But at the same time, the way you break down female sexuality is also fairly accurate for me, because I still need to feel like I connect in some way to the person even if I really don't intend anything beyond sex. Sex for purely physical enjoyment is where toys come in - I don't feel bad about using them.  And that's what I really love about your videos and this video in particular: You take a VERY complex subject, break it down to component parts, simplify, interrogate it, and then add the nuance back in. It's weird to me that TERFs can talk about the Male Gaze and how it affects women, but then think that it wouldn't also affect transwomen or, for that matter, men. I think this is part of why cismen tend to think catcalling is complimentary - they would like to be seen as sexual beings, but are aware that they are supposed to be the aggressors, not the objectified, and then deem all objectification as complimentary at its core (got into a very long argument about this with a partner at one point). And the flip point is that all objectification is bad and, if you dig it, you're either a pervert or brainwashed. I just think it's nice to feel attractive and wanted, some people care about it more than others, some people are more superficial about it than others, some people are more allowed to express that than others, and that's all fine except the last one.  Thank you so much for sharing. And, because I feel like maybe you'll get what I mean, you are so GORGEOUS, both physically and mentally. I enjoy your videos as much as for the aesthetic as I do for the intellectually stimulating content.  <3
If anyone's an "autogynephile", its my nasty ass watching my tits jiggle in the mirror when I take my binder off at the end of the day.
you look so pretty without all that make-up :P
11:21 I googled it... can someone send me some mind bleach?
as the video went on you just got prettier and smarter. i love your voice <3
“Filth is coming, don’t worry”
Um, not to overshare Natalie, but I am a cis woman who wears a bra almost every night. Gotta keep the girls up when you've had at least C cups since age freaking eight.
This took me two hours to watch because every 30 seconds, what you said was either SO informative or SO HILARIOUS I had to rewind and watch again. Bless you girl. Bless you.
badass
we're the same age. i feel so close to you rn.
I know this sounds like a terrible cliche, but how do I like this multiple times?  I already considered myself as quite open minded, although that hardly happened by itself. But, I am so happy for context that has always been out of reach. This sort of thing is invaluable. I guess that I have been subscribing to the spectrum theory, and figuring out where you and your limits are on those, can be important.  This probably means nothing, just some thoughts I have, but for quite a long time I have seriously wondered things like what if I was born female. In the end, I am pretty sure that I have come to a conclusion that I am happy being a guy. All the same, I do find myself often using female characters in games, and it is not for stupid reasons like I want to watch a woman's butt. Honestly, there is a certain empowerment for me in being the strong female character. It never felt right for me when I play a strength focused male character, but it kind of does when I play female, like that is the other me. Have no idea what that means.  Back on the spectrum thing, I am pretty sure my sexuality is on it too. In saying that, I am pretty sure that I would identify as straight, even when roll playing, I feel nothing for men in the masculine way. At the same time, I have found myself stronger attracted to woman that have some traits one might call masculine. And to mention the times I have found myself kind of drawn to very feminine guys, much to my confusion when finding out what gender they were when I was younger, because I was pretty certain that I was not gay. I honestly have no idea what it can mean, except maybe lately thinking I could be happy with a trans person.  Writing these, kind of feels embarrassing. But hearing what was in this video made me want to share, especially since Natalie said her sharing thing also was tough for her. At the end of the day, my biggest problem is my social anxiety though.
heh, females are gross.
You're amazing and I love you and your videos. You are so real and you explain everything so well. It's like hearing someone else articulate what I already believed. Anyway, I appreciate you and I've learned so much that can help me with my relationships with trans people- friends and significant others
You are amazingly brave sharing your personal experiences with the whole world. I'm just impressed.
I don't even know how to write this without sounding like a complete creep (especially since this is a third comment I am leaving on your social media in the past week). It shows a great talent how you can make a video which is very educating and it also makes someone (=me) laugh and cry a bit at the same time. Also, this helped me understand the way I feel attracted to women a bit more. Also also, I hope you are happy and will be happy. You are incredibly beautiful plus obviously funny and intelligent, and that's the whole package! Also also also, your laughter makes the world a brighter place.
You are a beautiful, intelligent goddess. Every day.
This is an incredibly well made and well thought out video and everyone should watch the whole thing AT LEAST once, but for the people like me who keep coming back for the song, 46:51
That was actually refreshing and compelling. You did good today. (trump troll supporter, old channer and dude that thinks a lot of queer kids are just men scared of the conflictual aggressive nature of the male gender role)
Thank you so much for the advice to google "fucksaw incident."  There's something about the juxtaposition of careful university administrator verbiage and the word "fucksaw" that has me laughing so hard I that I hurt myself.
"I am at core a woman who is very thoroughly not in love with myself"... I am a cishet woman, and I totally feel you. It can be a long journey toward self love, for a myriad of reasons. But angel, you are whip smart and so incredibly inventive and just lovely (and funny as fuuuck!). You ARE loved. But yes, I hope that you (and I both) find someone that loves you, inside and out. X!
I stepped upon Dreger's book a few years ago and started reading it. I could not finish it (lost it in the subway, no regrets in the end), but I was quite startled by the autogynephilia theory. Not actually shocked as I'm not a woman of any kind, but very sceptical about the scientific content of such a thing. Out of the noise of the internet and militants people (I'm not really fond of), your point of view was informative on a topic I did not found any really pertinent resources on (and I kind of forgot in the back of my mind actually).  Thank you.
@24:15 wait a second...I'm supposed to be ashamed of the fact that a cum super hard when i beat off into a mirror?? I find myself very sexy, and when I can watch myself masturbating in a mirror I get off.  Granted, its not like I get aroused anytime I look into a mirror. I don't get an erection from my reflection haha. If I'm already masturbating, and I need an assist, beating it s mirror helps...so maybe what I'm trying to articulate isn't quite what you're describing...  I can see that using my reflection as a masturbation aide isn't "normal" but I've always been able to rationalized it. I'll say 'how can someone find me sexy if can't sexualize myself;" a sort of bastardization of that old idiom about loving yourself before someone else can love you.  Edit: lol I paused the video to type all that and you basically covered everything I talked about... I guess I was on a similar wavelength
I don't believe in Heaven but if it exsists DOGS HAD BETTER FUCKING GO THERE. I WILL PUNCH GOD IN THE FACE!
As a cis white dude, I wish trans woman would just call themselves woman so there wouldn't be a societal taboo around me think [trans]woman are hot.    PreOp, PostOp, whatever. You know the old saying; If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and has tits like a duck...
The joy when a new favorite references an old favorite (plinkett)  *squee*   Super awesome channel.  Thank you.  <3
Also, I sleep in a bra every night. (yes, I know it's not good for me. I do not care. It's comfy.)
I strongly relate to your comparison of male vs female sexual experiences. I've always found it very weird that somebody would want to have sex with someone purely based on visuals, I'm almost always turned on by situations and actions and very rarely visuals, and when I am turned on by visuals, only visuals of my close romantic partner. I also find that men rarely understand that I don't need to cum to enjoy sex, and wanting sex doesn't necessarily mean wanting to cum- while they will understand it in concept it never really translates to them not feeling uncomfortable when I don't cum. I also know from studies that most women are bisexual to some degree, and I am myself. However..... I absolutely cannot relate to being paraphilia free. I have more paraphilias than most men I know 😂
I *did* come here for science, but.... This was cool too
Why are these stupid philosophy people making you explain your sexuality lol
Personally I wear a sports bra almost 24/7. Though I have gender dysphoria over my breasts. The sports bras make them feel less "out there" and they feel closer to my body.  Of course since having my daughter almost four months ago I've switched to a nursing bra 24/7. What's strange is since becoming a mother I've felt a lot more comfortable in my skin. I would have thought the opposite beforehand. I did hate being pregnant though. That was due to discomfort more than anything. And I felt oddly embarrassed that people would see me pregnant which could've been a sort of dysphoria? I don't know if women commonly feel that way. It's just that I'm a very private person and there's no hiding being 8 months pregnant. I also told my husband I read an mpreg story and related to it so sometimes I think I felt like a pregnant man lol.  This video got me thinking about all of this. I haven't given my feelings about my gender much thought lately.  Man I feel vulnerable saying all of this...
I don't have anything useful to add, but Autogynephilia would be an amazing album title
GOD DAMN THOSE ARE PERFECT TEETH
*grabs a beer and laughs it up* one of the few advantages to being NB
I think the first type makes a lot of sense, and I would even add that transitioning into women makes them more attractive to lesbian types if they like women, just overall women get more attention and lots of men are starving for attention.
Oh shit now I have to google the fucksaw incident. EDIT: Okay I googled it & have come to the conclusion that this professor is in no position to be labeling anyone a pervert.
Quite eye-opening and I am thankful for your openness and level-headed treatment of the subject. I have talked with many women about their (and my) sexuality, but they were always heterosexual. I have also talked with many homosexual men about their sexuality, but I feel awkward talking about this with lesbians (because of all the political baggage that gets triggered these days), and I don't personally know any trans person. Therefore I appreciate you putting yourself out there and describing what things felt and feel like for you.  The issue is, though, that - albeit great - the description of your experience is ultimately anecdotal. Is there any qualitative study literature on the subject that isn't written by TERFs or transphobic pseudoscientists?
Unrelated but can anyone who also looked tell me the purpose of the “fucksaw?” I tried finding Michael Bailey explaining the actual purpose but all I got was his response to controversy
You absolutely slay in every single video. So on point. And so on ContraPoint ❤️
As a cis dude it was SUPER interesting hearing you talking about diferences between male and female sexual drives. Thank you
I love the comment about identifying with the scary monster version of yourself! I absolutely find that empowering, too!
Funny thing is, as a kinky ace, I actually could be accurately described as 'pseudo-bisexual' in the way you describe the term, because I like both men and women sexually only in the context of my fetish, and not in the standard "that individual looks hot" sense. You could basically slot anyone who broadly fits certain criteria into my fetish situation and I'll get turned on, but in any other situation, they don't provoke any sexual feeling whatsoever. This can be shown in my fanfic reading habits, where I don't really care much about fandom or pairing but instead happily consume pretty much any fanfic that hits enough of my fetish buttons.
Great video. I'm concerned about the classification of male homosexuality as purely physical. (But what should we expect from hetero male "scientists"?)  I am a bisexual man, and my attraction to men isn't just lust for a hot male body. That's part of it, yes, but not all. Men attract me in an emotional way too. I like caring, kind, ambitious, intelligent men; I like men who I can have an intellectual discussion with; all that stuff. I don't just want a man with a tight ass and nice toned abs. I think the way heterosexuals view male homosexuality is problematic and needs to change. I'm sure there are many gay men who only have physical attraction to men. But saying that all gay and bi men care about is the body... well, it's just wrong. It's untrue and it paints a bad picture of men who like men.  This "hypersexual gay men" stereotype needs to end. It's harmful.
loving the fresh faced look babe!
That was a fucking fantastic video. By the end I was also thinking of Occam's Razor, like Jesus Christ how convoluted this man had to make his theories when people with this identify are EVERYWHERE and are saying they JUST FEEL LIKE A WOMAN! It really does make you wonder if he was just unwilling to admit that maybe, just maybe, he was sexually attracted to trans women. But nah, they are just sick, perverted autophiles that he definitely never fantasized about at any point
Hi Natalie. I found your videos about a week ago after my mom of all people started telling me about jordan peterson. I've been watching a couple every day and you are so amazing and good at what you do. There were a few things you said throughout this video that brought forth intense emotions, and some things I really needed to hear, so I just wanted to say thank you
Sick Groucho Marx reference!
You have no idea how much it hurt me, this idea that what I felt was some perversion. I constantly thought of it that way, and thought of myself that way. That I was some pervert who just pretended these feelings. Hearing you talk about it helps so much... it really does. To have this internal theory debunked, despite my lack of previous knowledge of it, really helped.

The moment I said I'd crossdress as a man was a pretty immediate pull back. At first it was put forward as a joke, nothing in me wanted to continue. And so, things happened, awkwardness continued as the look stuck instead of coming off. Support in the initial community was good at first but due to my own craziness I dropped off the planet. Asking profound and uncomfortable questions after transition, as you do, like "what is the moral of incest based on?" which probably messed with people.  What's the moral of anything? I'd already established I was a good person with unshakeable values of human life, not harming others needlessly and facing flaws about my person that could negatively impact someone else. (To the point where, I didn't become collapsed on and completely lose my individuality because my mere existence began to anger another).   The line where making fun of someone is funny and just mean-spirited power plays in a world where everyone's jealously defensive of their own status. And the depressed underside of it where we realize all the vain things we do are just a way of putting someone else down. What is good if there is no bad to distinguish it as superior? As my life went on these pains gradually replaced warmness, and now I'm 25.  I still think cheating on one's partner is impulsive.
If I draw things because I like them, what did that say about me, when I drew all of the firm, sculpted flesh of a greek God, the flaws which make them human, the muscle on his ribs, covered in a soft skin, taking great pains to learn about the human physique without hurting it.  Of course, I felt no such sexual desire on making it, and I was following a guide on drawing for life. Eventually, drawing a very difficult portrait. I hate the flaws.   I burned out trying to make something, repeatedly, bashing my head into it, until my head felt numb, and I couldn't feel my body as I could before, whilst someone else in my mind told me it wasn't good enough. Picking at anything it can.
Arghhh, I'm a pairat. What horrible things do you want to do to me in my feather hat?
Bitch just wanted a free lunch after all, too bad. I spent my time trying to make her feel better about herself, now she can suffer like the brat she always was.
What gets me is that even transgender experiences are kind of missing something. What if you're just a man, and you figure. "I want to be a woman" some day? You just want to experience that, and end up living that way. What could be incorrect about this decision? What could be incorrect about a woman, changing into a man, and not even feeling any particular way for it?  But you don't want to give up this false sense of self-importance. Men are better, women are better, black, white, asian, latino, whatever. This false sense of value in anything is emulating value. And don't tell me that people do not covet social power, status, abilities, skills, experiences, knowledge, don't tell me they're not greedy. That they don't also lower their positions, to make their personal failings less salient to others and themselves.  I get the impression that a lot of feminists don't want to let go of their ideal self-image as attractive, fulfilled women, same as many men though complaining of their duties as a man, would wish they could fulfill those obligations too. But do you need to be male or female to do anything noteworthy? No.  A woman needn't be anything that others expect. She can appear as anyone, who she is, what she desires, and what she does, are all part of her that are independent of her being part of this group. As a man, who becomes God, and decides that he will be a woman at the end, or any time in their life.  None of these things are meaningful in a grander sense, they just make us feel good. And if they are good, there is no reason at all to stop doing them.
"The man who would be queen." Fuck that I was a woman who became Queen.
"These inscrutable perverts can apparently get off just by looking in the mirror." Something inexpressible in the twinkle of my eye.
I think that the differences between men and women are biologically negligible.  How many of us can distinguish that difference  in other species without  "looking under the tail"?
Dogs don't go to heaven?

Girl you have a great singing voice 💖
All Hail ContraPoints!
Wow.  I only have just discovered your channel.  I feel like I now have this beautiful gift in this world.    You are smart,  funny,  creative.... beautiful.  You put forth some of the best arguments I can ever remember seeing in defense of the lgbtqia + community.  Especially when it comes to people who are trans.    I love that you were brave enough to be vulnerable. I know it isn't easy.  Trust me,  I am not sure I could ever be that vulnerable myself.  So I admire you so much for it.    I am in the middle of a lot of soul searching and trying to figure me out.  I have been out as bisexual for a very long time. There are aspects of me that I am still learning and trying to understand even as I have gotten into my 40's. I feel like I could learn so much from you.  Maybe I would finally feel comfortable in my own skin.    I just want to send a heartfelt thank you though.  The bravery you showed to be this vulnerable,  helped me so much because it made me feel less alone. As hard as it was for you,  I fell like I am getting to know a new friend.    I know there is a good chance you won't ever see this comment,  but if you do...if you are on facebook,  please add me.  I would love to talk with you.
The most unbelievable thing about this video is how the comments don't seem to be the most repulsive thing I have ever read. I mean good thing that you don''t appear to be drowning in abuse but I'm a little disappointed TBH. I guess I'll have to go find my faith in humanity after all.
Ray Blanchard? Who is that? Do you mean transsexual's daddy?
Actually, Natalie, many cis women wear bras to bed.  I don't think it's super common, but it does seem to be more common among women with larger breasts than those with smaller ones, just for the purpose of keeping them reined in, so, say their partners don't end up with black eyes if they're having a restless night's sleep.  I don't typically, but I did when I was pregnant and breastfeeding, because A) they were huge and super sensitive and B) otherwise I end up trying to sleep in a puddle of breastmilk.  Those pads for helping to soak up the milk don't stay where they are useful unless you're wearing a bra. So even if your reason for wearing a bra to bed may be different from your cis gendered sisters, doing so doesn't make you strange or weird.
Why can no one see that Cockbane and Kitty are fucking offscreen. Their little dirty secret is how much Cockbane likes that crop in Kitty's hand.
uh I’m in love w you
Hm what? Sorry didn't hear you over all your narcissistic rage ;)
This video finally gave me the vocabulary to put into words how I feel sexually. I am into guys as like a 7:3 ratio, and I am more into getting them aroused. In fact, I've had many sexual encounters in which I didn't ejaculate at all, but I felt fully satisfied (which almost every time the guy actually thought there was something wrong with me, like I was not well or something). On top of all that, I need an emotional connection with the physical one to have good sex. THANK YOU! Also I really love this channel! Big fan!
20 minutes on is like bwawwwAAAAhh?wwhhhhhhssSSSAAAAA???
If you published a report on autogynephilia in cis (supposedly het) men, I'd read the shit outta that.
I just really love this channel.  Its unlike any other on the platform! Great work, babe <3<3<3
I‘m getting cranky!
Omg I love you ❤
Thank you for the time and effort you are putting into this.  You are making a difference!  If I ever see you out and about in Baltimore, I will totes buy you a drink or a snack.  Keep being awesome.
This video is very brave, and I have found every piece of content I've binged since finding your channel insightful. Thanks.
i'm speechless with this video, you're an absolutely amazing person.
To be honest Blanchard just seems like a transphobe with actual scientific skills.
can i be an autogynephilic trans man?
"I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me." Me, all the way
As a mostly straight cis woman I can say that I think your description of female sexuality is on point
Natalie, thanks. The song was really nice. The rest of the video also, in case that doesn't go without seeing.
I'm a hetero cis woman who is definitely turned on by/ sexually interested in a man's body and really *isn't* interested in being wanted or observed in the moment. I'd rather focus on how sexy I find a man's body than think about what I look like or what he thinks of me. I tend to objectify men and prefer not to be in the spotlight or on display at all. Maybe I am in the minority?
Thank you for posting this;  It was really interesting, despite my complete ignorance of the topic and what it means to be a trans person. Actually, I think it was more interesting because of that fact.  I don't know your life or your particular struggle, but I do know, as I imagine most do, what it means to desperately cover your vulnerabilities, and the feeling of having those vulnerabilities exposed.  Thank you for sharing those raw nerves for the benefit of random schmucks on hour four of a YouTube K-hole.
I couldn't take Blanchard seriously out the gate as he focused only on transgender meaning one side of the experience. He had no similar research that focused on trans men, which when I first read of him, made me more immediately suspicious than anything else before I actually dove into the rabbithole. Mostly because his decision to focus on discrediting the experience of women reeked of misogyny.   After taking hormones, I've come to the conclusion that I'm bi, but my predominate attraction has definitely always been with men. I slept exclusively with gay/bi men before I got HRT, and after having the same boyfriend before and after that, I'm pretty confident that I'm still vastly more attracted to men.   Gay cis men can be really mean, but so far nobody has swung at me with a over-constructed theory about how the only reason why I like men is because of my "desire" to be one. Being treated like my actual gender during sex, as per my boundaries, is less of a turn-on and more of a standard to not make everything a total turn-off. Of course that feels more intense than I normally would treat it because it's an experience I've had to work for both with myself and others. There's parts of my transition that I can't imagine life or sex without and am honestly surprised I wasn't broken by the lack of before.  But why is that? I know more trans men with similar experiences than I do trans men who are entirely straight. No-one is trying to dismantle our attractions on such a brutal level, at least to my knowledge. Not from outside of the community. Cis men are just way more obsessive about discrediting women's experiences, and I guess trans men are either invisible or credible enough to avoid being in the line of fire...? Either answer brings forth more compelling concerns on top of the ones already listed.
you're so fucking cool
Cis woman here, I can't sleep without a bra either. When I was growing up puberty hit me like a brick, and one night after not wearing a bra to bed my growing breasts hurt like hell just being let loose. Shirts chafe me if I'm not wearing a bra as well. And I have these irrational intrusive thoughts when I'm not wearing bras involving any kind of horrific harm that could come to my nipples, I even hold my breasts with one arm in the shower over these fearful thoughts. So buh-bam, you are not alone in wearing bras in bed. Just over a very different reason.
44:31 huh. I'm cis and I do it to prevent stretch marks and premature sagging (*sigh* my poor poor skin. So unwilling to stretch) and provide extra support.
Do you not like silence of the lambs? It's cool if you dont but I like that movie a lot. :(
"Sometimes you have to explain what it means to be trans to someone who believes dogs go to heaven" 😍
When you were talking about how your sexuality changed after hormones, your description of a more "feminine" sexuality made perfect sense to me. It's like you were describing the exact things I started to feel when I went through puberty, so that being tied to your hormones was like a lightbulb moment for me that I had never considered before. I never liked porn (as in videos) as a teenager because the visual stimulus just didn't do it for me, and instead of seeking out photos or videos, I read fanfiction (yes, I was one of those). I was just so much more drawn to stories where two characters would fall madly in love with each other and the sex was like this culmination of passion, and I always thought, "Damn, I wish someone would want me as much as these two want each other." I'd heard of trans women's sexuality (as in the expression of it, not just the orientation) changing as they start hormones, but I'd never really understood it until you illustrated this specific example.
I just hate these kind of self-entitled pricks.. "I know better what trans women are even though I have no idea what's it like and all of them disagree with me." And then they call that "scientific". Sure.
are you demisexual? or on the asexual spectrum? your description of your sexuality sounds a bit like that.
the three times a lady song in the end is heart-breaking ... thanks for sharing all of your experiences. you're incredible.
I fkin love u. As cringy as this sounds this video was really “validating”.
I have a friend who transition Ed very late in life, and I have always felt nervous about asking her about it.  I realize, of course that you don't speak for all trans women, but thanks so.much for the deep dive.
The only time I ran into the term autogynephilia was in a paper about pedophiles that claimed a large percentage of these people (all men, I assume) are attracted to thinking of themselves as children. So what are these researchers claiming? That the reason pedophiles resort to touching children is that they can't be children themselves or as a surrogate to an age-based gender dysphoria?  Yeah, I don't think there's much good that's gonna come from assuming an essential autogynephilia with any orientation or identity.
"Autogynephilic Harry Plinkett"  OOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH MYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY GOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDD
I want to say, "Thank you." I am a cisgendered woman with... flexible sexuality? But I'm also predominantly asexual do to also being neuroatypical. That being said, your breakdown of male sexuality vs female sexuality helped me finally understand the WHY of my sexual self - why visual pornography does nothing for me, among other things. I found you quite by incident, a happy suggestion by Youtube's algorithms. And I'm so glad I found you. So much of what you say makes sense to me in ways that I've found difficult to articulate to others. I might not ake much sense at times, but the point is, you've touched me in a good way. Thank you so much.
Agh Natalie I literally love you. You are amazing.
Ok you’re at 6 mg a day? Wtf is my doctor doing... I’m only at 4 mg.a day and I’ve been on it for 5 months.
I can't repeat this enough. thank you for being here. thank you for doing this. you are precious and beautiful inside and out. and so funny <3  I hope you're doing well and have a lovely day. all the love from berlin!
*Heterosexual maaaaaaaaaaaa-*
I sleep in a bra, so you're not alone. At least one cis woman does it.
NATALIE YOU ARE A TREASURE
You’re so iconic I adore you
God this genuinely made me really sad
Hey, the opening theme is to the tune of montagues and capulets by Prokofiev!!! I knew that!!!
t h e  f u c k s a w
You're just really out here saying things we all needed to hear. You don't sugar coat things and stay true to what's right. You are my president, my queen, and my mother.
Im cis and apparently Im autogynephilic as fuck, I had no idea there was even a term for it before watching this video, much less the transphobic history behind it. This was an interesting perspective, I appreciate how informative your videos are.
As a cis woman, i'm turned on by myself and my own capacity for sexual bliss for instance.. i also like to desire en seduce men i find sexy or alluring in a way, to be passive, is not my thing.
I learned so much from this video. 💛
the greatest channel ive ever subscribed to! WHY ARE WE NOT FUNDING THIS!!!!??????
i loveyou
Calling a trans woman "autogynephilic" is basically more anti-feminist bullshit is what I learned. But I also learned a lot of stuff my brain hurts...I masturbate like a lot and like video games and I was a tomboy...I fantasize and get off on those fantasies about men but I am aroused visually more by females...I am pretty damn pagan I sleep in a bra...man what the hell am I? Idgaf I love my cats and I like psychedelics. I miss my friend Ashley and worry that my lack of trans understanding fueled just a little bit to her suicide. Did I treat her too girly and she thought I was being fake? Not girly enough because I'm kind of gruff and bitchy and high? Did she think I was condescending...Why does it have to be such a big deal what we are to people and cause so much pain inside
Natalie, you deserve someone. You put in too much work into life to not get anything out of it. Cheers, and best of luck!
Lol Anthony Weiner
What was that operatic song at the start
>tfw "representing yourself as a scary monster as a means of self-expression"  ...hm. That bit gave me... some things to think about.
Nobody's forcing you to feel that way, but don't put down others because that's the way they feel. I'm a proud autogyne. I fetishize my own permanent female body. I LOVE having tits a juicy wet pussy. I worship the female body but simultaneously respect it too.
Thanks for explaining this, pretty lady.  It really made me lol, in the beginning. the cis is truly unamazing. And really? Easier to date as a hetero trans woman?! That sceintist really Don't know what dating is like. Or how popular young femme gayboys Are.  I think they are probably the most fucking demographic of all.
Rubbing one out.
Oh plus your comments on cis woman’s sexual attraction to men was spot on. My mother a nurse always said “ I’ve seen plenty of penises and still ain’t seen a pretty one”
Bloody hell! I feel like I’ve been struck , Thanks so much for teaching an old cis lady an amazing amount. Your videos have inspired me to learn more.
this video is really informative! your analysis allows for a critique of a biological basis for gender in a way that neither excludes nor erases the trans community!
I hope by now enough people have thanked you for sharing your perspective to make the unpleasant parts worth it. I'd like to add my own thanks to the growing pile. Your videos are always thought provoking and profound :) from an asexual, cis, corset wearing (gasp!) woman who's still learning about most things.
I was not prepared for Contra as a cop... but I'm definitely into it.
I'm a trans man and have what I think is a pretty strange experience with sex and sexuality. Mainly because I am attracted to myself as a female. I am a sort of an autogynephile I guess. But I'm attracted to myself as if I weren't me. I hate that it's my body, but I think it's a hot body. I take pictures and do videos for people, but I keep my face out not just so I can hide my identity, but because If my face is in it I get extremely dysphoric.   Would I fuck me? Yes, but only if I wasn't me. As weird as that sounds.
Hey, standing in front of a mirror, dancing to Q Lazzarus, asking "Would you fuck me?" is quite normal. I do it often. Every dragqueen night.
I do not think trannies are all sexual perverts. I do not think al trannies are legit trannies. Just look up detransitioning, the number seems to be rising steadily. Some things are hard and should stay hard, to prevent you from making a choice too easily. Transitioning should be viewed with caution. It is now overaccepted, you are made out to be transphobic and get lambasted for not wanting a chick with a dick, and that gets you results like Jenner, that wants to transition, decides not to because in the end he was just a transvestite with too much money and no real barriers. Just look up detransition on Tumblr or YT. Hell, impressionable young me might have fallen to the trap, just because I like to wear a dress and dance. It just makes me a transvestite, and not a tranny. Who knows what the result may have been had being a tranny been so accepted when I was young, I may have turned out something like Zahra Cooper. The hormone treatments and surgeries have lifelasting consequences. I'd have a pussy and no dick anymore.   I follow lolcows. I like to do that, see them fuck up and do outrageous shit. Example 1: Narcissa Wright. Loses the record, then loses the balls. Already painted his nails, "just for fun and looks". Then came the hormones, then the "categories are abitrary" and it all went to shit. Now streams, makes weird comments, just rambles on about Smash these last days, sits in his dimly lit room, looking dejected, munching on shrooms and other psychedelics, often staring at the wall silently, with the streamchat closed because people asked the wrong questions, and now just has a chat on Discord which is closely monitored and consists only of those praising him. Throws a near literal party when someone orders him a pizza. This guy just is not trans even though the doctors giving him the Estriadol state he is. The drugs and something else just got to him. Will fondle his own tits and be happy about the comforting feeling.  Or how about Chris Chan. If you do not know him yet, look him up. Internets greatest dumbass, and these days, trans. Will whack off to My Little Pony music, randomly mace Gamestop employees because Sonics arms are blue, may or may not have fucked his mother, drinks his own sperm, and we barely even scratched the surface.   Kelli Knipe, fresh off the presses. Has a massive lactation and cow fetish, will dress up as a cow and try and milk himself all the day, and his psychiatrist mother is fully supportive. Will wear a cowbell around his neck in public and don some cowears, lamenting not having enormous milkfilled breasts for all the men to suckle on. No, this is not a joke, just look it up. Has some weird ass art made for him.  You may call them just perverts, some may call them just freaks in dresses. Whatever the case, the world at large and the medical professionals call them transsexuals. I think that these 3 lolcows are autogynephiliacs. Or whatever other term you may insist on. I see someone like Blair White and do not think she is in any way shape or form an autogynephiliac. What it probably comes down to is you need a stable and level headed individual to make a good choice about changing ones gender.
Tbh cis women do stand in front of the mirror trying on high heels and sexy clothes while analyzing their sex appeal. Like, 20% of fitting room activity, and something many women do while getting dressed!
Thank you for sharing your experiences and perspectives; I've tried to be an ally to trans people, just in general, because it's the decent and human thing to do. But this video was incredibly courageous and enlightening, and I feel like I can understand and empathize on a level that I wasn't able to before because you made this video. I had never heard of autogynephilia before, and having watched this video, I can now be a better ally by understanding these supposed 'scientific' arguments that so boorishly invalidate the identities of my trans sisters, and why they are harmful. You are incredible; I have enjoyed all of your videos so far, but I think this one is my favorite.
One of the things I found most surprising in this video was that the theory of autogynephilia was being used to try to invalidate transwomen, I had no idea people took it that way! I happened across it for the first time not long ago, it was just a passing mention in some results I got on a personality quiz of all things, and it intrigued me so much I read a little bit more on it. I was fascinated, but never once did it occur to me it could be used as an argument against transwomen, I only understood it as describing a specific group of men. In fact I thought it was specifically limited to men who enjoy the eroticism of exploring female things but ultimately wished to remain male, thus having nothing at all to do with the kind of people who are transwomen. It just seemed obvious to me that it was its own category of people. Because otherwise, nothing explains why not all men who would exhibit "traditionally" female behaviors and mannerisms would go on to transition to living their lives full time as women. There are many gay men who speak and act effeminately who would resent having their manhood denied, there are many men who dress as women occasionally (like drag queens) who again, do not wish to be seen as the same way as cis women are seen. (I wish I had more eloquent words for some of this, ugh.)   A friend of mine is a drag queen, and yes he likes to be referred to with female pronouns when in drag, but in his daily life he considers himself a man and lives as one. Doing drag empowers him, and is for him a form of self expression. He gets to make his own outfits and work out sets for shows, he gets to be creative. For him that is the end goal in itself, to enjoy doing these things *as a man.* To transition and do them as a woman would have no meaning for him the same way being a man and only wearing men's clothes all the time wouldn't be special to him. He is gay, and he wants to experience his relationships *as a gay man* NOT as a woman, that's why his sexuality and his drag dress have no bearing on each other; he doesn't dress up because he wants to experience the world as or be received as an "ordinary" woman, he likes living as a man, likes occasionally dressing provocatively as a man, and experiencing his relationships and sex as a man. This is clearly not the same as someone who wishes to live as and be treated as an "ordinary" woman in their day to day life. After getting a more nuanced understanding of autogynephilia from this video, I don't think you could even make an airtight case for my drag queen friend being one, let alone a transperson being one, so as I said I was really confused as to how people were even trying to apply the description of an autogynephiliac to a transperson. But again thanks to the video, I now know that the theory was posited to try to explain transgender people in the first place so I see things kinda got off to a bad start with the whole thing anyway.   Tldr, I love the video, and I think people need to understand that while there surely are some people who have pretty much purely sexual motivations for dressing up in erotic women's clothing (I mean that kind of clothing wouldn't exist if there weren't) that those people are not really the same category that transpeople are in and that there's far, far more to being transgender than just questions of sexual arousal and pleasure.  Ps I absolutely loved that description of female sexual desire, it just clicked so perfectly with me. I've never ever heard it expressed so articulately and accurately before. Also, Contra can rest assured that at least one cis-het woman has slept with a bra on. I've done it plenty of times and literally did it last night. Sometimes it's just really comfortable, but a lot of times I do it when it's a chilly night because it's an extra layer of warmth. Last night though I was just too damn tired to take it off before I fell asleep lol.
Your emotional labor, as ever, is greatly appreciated.
bravery is knowing it could cost you and doing it anyway. You are one hella brave woman.
When Natalie has those moments where she laughs, I smile. Her most recent videos I've seen first and I haven't seen these genuine moments where she just blurts out a sensible chuckle until this video and its easier to empathize for some reason.
Amazing video!
"You just found a person who built a sex robot" made me spit my hot chocolate, how the heck is this so funny
I love and appreciate you and your content! I also love your wallpaper, which looks like it's screaming!!
Not totally relevant to this particular video, but wow... I haven't been the great Ally I believed I was... I'm so glad to be learning so much about transgender, female, and human experiences. Thank you for making me a better person
as an afab nonbinary this is interesting just because of the little comments on (heterosexual) cismen vs (heterosexual) ciswomen sexualities
You're such a good piano player! :D
This was really insightful and educational. I learned a lot. It's hard sometimes to find someone I can listen to and retain information from, why this is who knows. I find that in you though. You could do a 2 hour lecture on the history of cling film and i'd finally be the cling film expert my parents knew I would be.   Also major props for the in depth and personal information you gave.
@ContraPoints Thank you, really.  As a straight male who is a true and cold leftist .  I want you to be you and feel like yourself.  I do have a serious question though.  I was once hit on by a trans woman at a bar who wanted me to do her on the first night I met her and I told her that I wanted to get to know her first.  She got frustrated right away.  As a true leftist I am also a feminist and I want to know what she must have felt that night besides drunk.  It bothers me that I had no idea how to react to her even though I did ask for her phone number.
This video was informative, funny, clever, smart, cute, etc. keep up the good work!
I literally had to watch this in three parts.  You look in the place we cannot look...well, at least not without needing a lot of.....milk. You tickle the ivories so nicely! Thanks for the song!
you are so brilliant and so beautiful. god bless you
Omg I love you so much!!! You're so sweet, smart, funny, and authentic. Oh and super beautiful <3 thank you for being vulnerable on the internet for us!!
So as i'm listening to you  thinking this theory somehow feels a lot like a sexist made it up, but i couldn't put my finger on it, especially after the supposition that cis men assume TW think more like CM than CW. THIS IS ALL TO SAY THAT "The hypersexual pervert vainly in love with the image of himself as a woman" HIT LIKE A MIC DROP!!!
I'm surprised you've only so recently transitioned! Thank you so much for "part 6: An Erotic Life." So much affirmation in there! I mean, I've heard the stories before, but it seems more real coming from you, since you... seem more real than the other strangers! Thanks, much respect, you're amazing! <3<3<3<3<3<3
You are an incredibly courageous woman. YT doesn't deserve such a video. But thank you so much for posting.
This made me cry at  The end. Then I laughed.   I am watching you to stop being a TERF.  It boils down to why hurt people?
Te amo, pero amararía mas si tuvieras subtitulos al español. Muah
As always, there will be people doing stuff out of some fetish or paraphilia, but you don't see people denouncing people eating carrots or mowing the lawn as filthy deviants, even if there probably are SOME people doing it out of some strange and perverted reasons. Being trans is probably something about weird stuff in the brain, and I don't really believe in souls or "essence". Left-handedness also has something to do with strange (in this case mirrored) neural pathways and nerves and stuff. We do know, I believe, that the brain of a trans woman looks more like the brain of a woman than the brain of a man does, and vice versa. If I did some selective case studies, I could "prove" whatever the hell I wanted, but that wouldn't make it true.
This video is so badass. Thanks for how much effort, empathy, and selflessness you put into these
Ok so I have been absorbing your videos with an almost reckless abandon, and I have a million questions. How can I ask them, and would you be inclined to answer?
I mean ok you make important videos and your arguments are on point but GODDAMN I LOVE YOUR VISUALS
I'm sorry but where exactly do Apache Attack Helicopters fit into all of this?
Just completely random thought:  I'm a cis woman and I wear corsets, fishnets, garter belts and wear a bra to bed.  The first three make me feel pretty and the last is because I find it more comfortable.
I am in love with you and I plan to comment on every video you've ever made about how I am in love with you.   It's kind of my thing, I try to keep it in my pants but I can't help it, you're just so good and perfect and amazing. 😭
Thank you so much for your openness and your willingness to explore fraught topics. Just watched a bunch of your videos after hearing you on Chapo. I have to admit, the fact that gender essentialism seemed to be such a pervasive explanation for why people transition (I'm a woman at my core, I was born in the wrong body, etc), has made me look to other explanations, similar to Blanchard's, though I didn't know of him. I've struggled with this because I'm involved in queer activism — I volunteer with a queer mental health org — and I want to be supportive of trans people but have a hard time supporting ideas akin to souls with fixed genders, when I'm not religious and lean genderqueer myself. To hear a trans person who doesn't see it this way, but puts essentialist notions in context ("explaining it to people who believe dogs to go heaven"), helps me a lot. It's easy for me to understand offering a different explanation than your own, more complicated internal one. I do that all the time as a gay man. I don't believe I've always been gay or I was born that way, but I let most people assume that because it's easier. Again, thanks.
This was really foreign to me but thanks for sharing something so complex and personal in such an elocuent and charismatic way, you're just amazing as a video maker, keep up your amazing work!
I mean, I'm turned on by my legs in some nice pants. I'm a female (mostly) so does that make me a autogynephilic?
i want the sex robot too damn
I have encountered a few people with paraphilic desires about being a woman that are not transexual...and I'll admit, some of those encounters have been depressing. There is this sad combination of 'I'm unhappy with my life' and 'I find the idea of being a woman arousing' that leads to some people misidentifying themselves as transsexual because it gives a concrete 'Here is a thing, that if it was different, everything would be better' root cause to the complex issues of life. You can see it a lot in the gender-swap (It's mostly called TG but that causes more confusion with Transgender so I won't use that) community, as so many of the talking points are 'You becomes a woman, as a woman there is no issues in life, you instantly becomes ungodly attractive and life becomes great and hot lesbians want you'. There is almost no focus on 'Wanting to see themselves as a woman' and a massive amount on 'These are unhappy things that would magically go away, if I was a woman'.  I must stress, I am NOT saying this is everyone and definitely not saying that anyone transsexual is fooling themselves. It's a weird reflection of Incels (And, as Contrapoints has pointed out in another video, some parts of the transgender community), where people go 'I am unhappy and by tying it to something I cannot change, this unhappiness becomes something not to work to fix'. It also always came across as...kinda sexist. The idea that women are put on such a massive pedestal and everything negative about the female experience is ignored. Heck, for a while, I WAS one of these people as I was in a massive depressive spiral and misidentified 'I find the idea of being a woman sexy' with 'Maybe if I was a woman, my brain would stop hating itself'. Fortunately, I got the psychological help I needed, with a psychologist would would have been very understanding had the situation been genuine rather than a manifestation of my depression and inability to understand why I was depressed.  I will freely admit, it's an area I'm not entirely sure how to sensitively engage with. As you encounter people talking about their life experiences on forums and then saying 'if I was a woman, this wouldn't be like this', when those life experiences that make them unhappy are not related to being a woman or not. Where every talk about wanting to be a woman is not...about themselves, so much as how becoming this mythical other race, blessed by the gods and eternally lucky, would help their life. You don't want to come across as transphobic or deny someone's actual transgender desires but I worry about some of those self-identifying in such ways as I did.  I think in the end, all I can say is that I'm glad that psychologists and actual qualified professionals are part of the transition for many people To help transexual people transition as they should and also to, hopefully, help those who are genuinely in need of another form of help.
I am SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO into my own body. Like sure I’m into OTHER people, but I’m PHYSIOLOGICALLY super duper duper duper into myself.   Masturbating in mirrors, sucking my own boobs...  ALL OF IT.   Why would it be bad for someone trans to want to do it?  Really, what im extrapolating from this wonderful video is that I really am a gay male drag queen who happened to have been born tucked.
This was absolutely brilliant. The part about vanity trope was incredible, and just absolutely blew me away! Well done!   Thank you for using your platform for speaking about such important issues. I really admire your courage to speak out.   (Also as a side note about sleeping in bras, there are actually a lot of cis women who sleep in bras, whether it's for support or just for comfort, so you are certainly not alone in sleeping in bras!)   xoxo with love from a nonbinary viewer :)
There was a ton of interesting information and valuable analysis in this video, but I'm honestly just dying of laughter at the switching between the sultry narrator voice and *I LATER FIND OUT SHE'S FROM BELIZE*
Can we have a whole version of that AGP initial song?
I love you and I just want you to know: I am a cis woman and I sleep in my bra semi-regularly and two I am a cis woman-child-thing  who is looking forward to wearing corsets and fishnets. You’re not alone even outside of the trans community.
"Fortunately, I have no sense of self-respect or dignity" You are a true gem in this bleak world.
Re: wearing a bra to sleep. I'm AFAB and did the same through preteenage-ism to around 18. Be careful with the practice, though, because I'm pretty sure the constriction prevented me from growing actual breasts.
6:16 Lol wtf. What are we, the 19th century where what a scientist says that enters the public thought is irrefutable?
AFAB here, I find my sexuality so fucked up by my thoughts about gender. My earliest proper sexual fantasies were me as a gay man. And I thought I was the straightest girl on the face of he planet because of my deep obsession with maleness and masculinity and every single aspect of men’s bodies and lives. But then I had crushes on girls and I was like... oh. But I didn’t take those silly crushes too seriously since I was so obsessed with guys until I realised that being gay gave me a free pass to have as masculine a gender expression as I do desired and that I had my whole life been projecting things I wanted for myself into the idea of my “type” or ideal future boyfriend. Since claiming those things for myself I have becoming more into women. But I identify as no because I doubt both sides of my sexuality story. Am I interested in guys purely as an object of a very trans-like admiration? Does my interest in men, which I feel like was at least somewhat innate, seem to be fading because 1) I can’t deal with them viewing me as a girl and in queer relationships gender roles are a bit less intense 2) dating women is the sort of thing a nice normal straight amazingly masculine man would do? Can’t tell. Also I may just be a cis bisexual autoandrophile since I am turned on somewhat by the clothing I wear or more I was in the beginning especially. And I think of myself as a guy during sex moreso than any other time, when I am pretty indifferent.
You might be right. I have slept in a bra before too.
natalie, editing cuts *particularly* on point in that intro. zoe, tunes are killin it.
Wowza, when starting to watch this video I got very anxious with the topic and the nitty gritty it got into but going on further I felt so relieved with the points and statement being made by Contra and the progressing conversation she had along with learning and realizing more than I thought I would with this video which I have to gracious thank for. Also sub-note I also realized the symbolism that was in the start of the video and that deserves a round of applause
Bailey's writing reminds me of something I read last year, "[A] sociologist is a fellow who spends $100,000 to find his way to a house of ill repute." In this case, Bailey is a psychologist rather than a sociologist.
You're just f**king brilliant. Thanks so much.
In this comment I briefly discuss my sexuality in a somewhat similar fashion Contra does it in the video, hoping not only to share some thoughts normally directed inward, but also pay a tribute to, frankly, her bravery in doing it in a much more bold way and as a member of a much less privileged community. I feel kinda bizarre putting a disclaimer like this here but I am new to such matters of discussion in a totally public space and this is personal stuff. So a weird personal fallout from learning the perspectives of people like Natalie, people from backgrounds that differ radically from my own, white, basically straight, almost totally cis male, is the fact that, far from experiencing any type of straight or cis guilt, I now view my own sexuality in a somewhat worse light. That is not to say, of course, that this is a problem Contra or the LGBTQ+ community at large has, in my opinion, to bother themselves with, for they have actually pressing matters to consider, I am just saying I have developed this idiosyncrasy about the way I experience sexual desire as a consequence of learning about the possible alternatives: yes, mine is mainly visual and body-centered, yes, I normally need very little to become aroused, yes, while in social situations I have learned to control to varying degrees of success not only my behavior but also the desire itself, meanwhile, in the comfort of solitude practically anyone and everyone I have ever seen or imagined becomes at some point sexualized. This strange mechanism does not, anyway, or at least I think so at the moment, trigger any gender dysphoria or direct discomfort within my own body. Rather, at the moments it is most active, I feel pleasure submitting to it and accepting it as part of my identity, lusting freely. However, at those rare lucky moments my head works somewhat clearly I find that this type of relationship with my sexuality is passive at best - the very feeling of submission here is reason enough to reflect. The prospect of developing desire from actual interpersonal connection instead of trying to build that connection or even exist on my own while overshadowed by a wave of lust seems kind of nice. I, of course, hold no negative opinions on lust itself and free active sexuality in general. However, what perplexes and disorients me is the fact my own urges go in such discord with my more, shall we say, complex feelings. For example, I said above that I am "basically straight". That is true - I habitually pursue romantic relationships with women. That does not, however, mean I don't view other men sexually as well. On the contrary, from a purely physical point of view I get aroused by male bodies as well as female ones - it does happen much less frequently, but then again I don't seek arousal from looking at men nearly as often. The problem herein for me is not a fear of my own possible homo- or bisexuality, knowing or rather feeling I was bi or gay would actually probably make things easier - it is the fact that, unlike with women, I don't ever experience sexual desire for actual living men in my social circle or even, for example, male celebrities - instead what I can feel the sex appeal in is only the sexualized images of the male body, thus eliminating any possibility of a wish to pursue a romantic bond with a man, whereas with women everything works in a kind of equilibrium - there is the desire, but also the personal interest, I fantasize about the female body in abstraction but also exhibit physical attraction to my female friends - it works ok. This mess of a gay part of my sexuality I kind of have to attribute to the way I internalize desire in general. Anyway: tl;dr I'm fucked up but not that much, just enough to make myself perturbed.
Wow... This Blanchard dude really leaned far out the window. While this "feminine essence" stuff sounds to me like some new age esoteric stuff it's way closer to what actually seems to be the case. Robert Sapolsky has a playlist on human behavioural biology up on the Harvard channel and if I understood him right there is solid evidence for neuroanatomical differences in heterosexual vs. homosexual individuals as well as in cis vs. trans individuals. This would also make sense from an endokrinological viewpoint. During gestation a male fetus produces testosterone which in gets converted into estrogen inside braincells and triggers masculinization of the brain. Estrogen however gets filtered out of the bloodstream which is why usually female fetuses don't show any sign of a masculinized brain. Thus could btw. also be a reason why certain neurodevelopmental disorders seem to be so strongly correlated with sex. Anyway, if we assume this masculinization process somehow doesn't set in in a male fetus we'd end up with a female brain in a male body. This would then make perfect sense of the "female essence/soul" thesis without the non-scientific vocabulary.
Oh, you MORE than pass!  Like my opinion really matters, but you are very pretty. And BTW,  you also happen to be a freakin’ genius...
Bailey... what a CREEPY SICKO!!!
This was so brave and smartly delivered!!!
Yeah I am so narcissistically angry!  I mostly hate myself and want die, i'm so narcissistic.  I just want to be a mom, I want to feel life grow inside me, and bring that life into this world.
Every video topic is fitting for a senior thesis in sexuality research. It took me 5 months to research and write my thesis and you've managed to get your points across in a 30 minute educational video. I'm gagging
I've known plenty of cis girls that sleep in their bra
as a conservative, white, religious women the one thing that really bugged me about this video is that your bra strap is showing on only one side! either bring them both out or put them both away, your killin me smalls lol --love your videos
This video is one of the biggest points in my ongoing internal “am I or am I not trans” debate.  Thanks.
was putting off this one because it's like a fucking hour long but wow.  just...wow.    also nb and i felt a lot of this even though it's not super comparable
I love you and everything you stand for
Interesting stuff. I'm a straight-ish dude (probably around a 2 on the Kinsey Scale) and I go to the gym to get big muscly man muscles. I check myself out in the mirror nude sometimes because it makes me feel strong, powerful and like I've progressed. My slight attraction to younger slimmer twinky dudes comes from a pure power dynamic similar to my relationships with women. It's totally normal to be into yourself to some degree.
I am a autogynephilic cis woman apparently
Loving your videos, going through most in a binge. The fuck-saw incident *facepalms* did you know the guests who brought it, Ken and Sunny, did it specifically to get famous? Sunny went on to have a short-lived HBO show, "Sex with Sunny Megatron." I know of this because I used to work for Ken. Blanchard is total BS.
I'm a multiracial,  heterosexual leaning cis man born and raised in Europe in my late twenties. I started watching your videos only a couple of weeks ago. This video honestly moved me to tears. I have not seen one of your films that haven't been thoroughly researched, hands down well edited and profoundly self critical whilst always hitting the nail on the head on every topic you have been talking about.  Thank you. You have gained a devoted follower.  Excuse any spelling mistakes. English is not my first language.   Also ... I like the filth and I've tried the wine!
Thanks for your honest account regarding your own process of realizing you wanted to transition, but I´m now confussed as heck :S
Not to undermine the struggles of trans women going through these things but for me as a polysexual guy who has been immensely in love with a trans women it was such a hard thing to deal with that aspect of my sexuality, because I was lambasted for it even more strangely because the people who gave me shit didn't hate trans people but thought i was messed up or had a fucked up "fetish" for trans girls. fucksake
30:51 OH NO
Hmm this one didn't convince myself.
The only man who could ever be queen is, of course, Freddie Mercury. Duh. :-)
Ironic because Contra Points is a classic narcissist AGP.
I learned a lot. I had no idea that when you transition from a male to a female, you no longer have any blood and therefore cannot bleed. Very interesting.
Thank you, Natalie.
i always sleep in a sports bra  well im like an A cup and the bra is stretchy af so not that appauling
A million points for the Mr. Plinkett comparison
THAT FUCKING LIZARD HEAD IN THE BACKGROUND  WHAT
Kudos to Natalie for being able to talk about her own experiences with gender dysphoria so openly. Genuinely admirable.   I also like that she critiques the “gender essentialism” that seems to permeate the modern left. That is to say the idea that there is some fixed ‘inner gender’ or that it’s simply a case of “an x being trapped in a y’s body”.   She does provide a strong case for the use of such a narrative on an individual level, i.e. it’s far easier to get the layman on board with that then the reality which is no doubt more complicated. My only issue is, anecdotally at least, much of the left is sensitive to critiques of the gender essentialist narrative and will often shut down discussion outright for fear of it moving into transphobic territory. Understandable, but imo has the potential to be harmful in the long term.   As far as I am concerned the long term goal should be the abolition of gender altogether thereby allowing people to exist and express themselves however they see fit. Reifying the notion of an ‘inner’ gender will not only impede that but force both cis and trans people to try, and fail, to meet the arbitrary standards of the constructs of femininity and masculinity.   To quote a favourite anarchist of mine: “We are perfect altogether! For we are, every moment, all that we can be; and we never need be more”.
Your furniture turns me on
Thanks for your bravery and honesty
BUFFALO BILL IS NOT A TRANSSEXUAL
YOOOOOOOO IM A ROCKY SHADOWCASTER TOO!! I've played as rocky on every cast in Washington. You're super right about it being problematic, but thankfully it seems like most casts are working towards making it more trans friendly.
The fact that I wanted to experience my sexuality as a female was what finally convinced me, but that’s not a sexual arousal to myeloma as a woman.
The problem with the Autogynephilia theory is that no where would the "self" part require one to be trans. If the attraction to oneself MUST be a part of being attracted to women then cis lesbian MUST also be included in this. Also where is the bridge that being attracted to women would then require imagining oneself as a women then in connection with said transwomen seeking out other women for more than just sex.....that theory never made much sense to me.   It seems to me he was attempting to count crossdressers as transwomen because he didn't know how to explain bi or lesbian transladies.   Also I transitioned as a teen and I am attracted solely to women (please allow me a quick story time). I think he sees Autogynephilia as temporary and clothing based. Whereas my genitals don't magically swap back when I take off my clothes...… This is a full time gig. lol My attraction to women has always extended beyond simply the typical visual stuff, to sensual things and just being far more comfortable living with someone who is my gender (I really don't want to pick up any guys dirty boxers) I have more in common with 1 or 2 of my female friends than I do with ALL my male friends combined. Also of note, I did not crossdress. I did not try on womens clothes until well over a year on HRT when I couldn't hide my breasts any more.   When men talk about women I feel out of place with them even though I like women too. "That ass". Whereas I'm thinking. "Aww she's soft" =)  Every woman is an Autogynephilia with some fresh shaved legs after a hot bath/shower. Wish I had more time to share more thoughts, I have plenty.  As a final thought here how do you explain the findings that transwomen have been found to have neuroanatomy far closer to cis women than men. Is this is just feel good stuff because you don't want to sound like a SJW? Of course SJW is just an attempt to deflect being taken to task for bigotry, but that's another argument for another time.
I loved everything about this video, from start to finish. I watched almost all of your videos Contra and especially the more recent ones really show your talent in reasoning and making a point 💞
cute. smart. good .
C- had to stop at the end of part 6 because your experience sounded too familiar and it upset me, i think i might need to confront my denial about who i really am
20:16 patient number made me lol. Are you with me my Droogs?
Man I clicked on this because I wanted to know what the hell "Autogynephilia" meant lol
Ended Blanchard tbh.
Thank you Contrapoints.
I've had trans women on Fetlife demonise me for my autogynephilia. I've been told I'm misogynistic and transphobic for fantasising about having a female body for romantic, sexual and possibly monetary (sex work) gain. I'm just a bit discontent with my life and have a feminine side that I go through phases of wanting to indulge, so my dressing up feels like escapism as well as it giving me desirability that I never fully had in male form. I played with dolls as a kid and never really cared for sports. I had many female best friends growing up and as an adult find women more relatable then most men. I fancy women, yet have strong sexual attractions to men's dicks and bedroom wise consider myself more of a bottom. I suppose Blanchard would consider me a perfect example to support his flawed theory, but I am not trans and I don't have gender dysphoria, just a desire to engage in things that are unfortunately seen as weird for those born male to indulge in. Thank you for your video, especially the therapist tape and court room trial setups; I saw various bits of myself being described in those segments.
I'm new to your channel. I love the scientific approach. What did you study?   Good videos! I'm binging
I mean I sleep in my bra all the time because I'm too lazy to take it off...
Uhhh I know this was posted months ago, but do you plan on doing more singing? Because that bit at the end was great. I mean, the whole video was great, but the end part, yesss.
Wow this channel is phenomenal. I'm completely blown away. It's like a gift from another planet. Transylvania, perhaps.
This is a really cool and well-put video on some complicated but really important topics. Honestly I'm a bisexual cis woman but your explanation of your own sexuality as a transitioning trans woman really gave me a good insight into my own sexuality, and reading through the comments I don't think I'm the only one that has experienced the same thing. Putting your own experiences out there like this to support your analysis and opinion of these theories is a really brave thing to do, and I really respect the lengths you've gone to in order to explain all this to people. Really love your channel, I hope you keep on making awesome well-thought out videos on some complex/heavy but really important topics! You're doing god's work tbh
You look like a young Winona Ryder.
I know cis women who sleep in a bra. I know trans afab people who sleep in a bra. If you have a larger cup size you /will/ squish and pinch and otherwise put your breasts in uncomfortable positions while sleeping especially when you're someone who moves a lot while sleeping or trying to fall asleep.  You might not wear one for the same reasons, but you are far from alone.  I currently don't because I'm only 21, but chances are if I don't get a mastectomy or breast reduction before my breasts lose some of their hold, I will probably start sleeping in a bra.
Fancier crystal wine glasses are actually light and delicate, not heavy. This Christian bloke is a wine pleeb.
So I was listening to this while playing video games and I must say that the King Cotton song was a surprising choice for me.
This is very interesting. Not that it is any of my business really, but I did wonder how you saw yourself in your 'transitioning journey', when I watched your previous videos, as I do have trouble myself differentiating between wanting to be a 'woman' when you were born in another gender, and delusional thinking in general about conforming to some 'wished for' ideal of yourself, like wanting to be someone, anyone, else but yourself. It strikes me that, if you can legitimately say 'I was born the wrong gender', then couldn't you say the same thing about being born in the wrong race? If you imagine that a certain race better embodies certain attributes you personally find desirable and wish for.  Then, according to some, you would be 'culturally appropriating' if you tried to emulate that race. That it is some sort of arrogance and 'privilege' to pretend you could even understand that race and, at the end of the day, whether you want to be a six foot four NBA all star player, you will still be in the same mortal coil you were in before...just modified, and your experiences will be different from someone who was born and developed that way.    I think (to be honest) the whole incel thing is a heterosexual version of body dysphoria and alienation within one's given form...they probably would gratify themselves in a lot of ways socially, and personally, if they were 'chad' and conformed to a given ideal societal 'image' but they aren't...and ultimately I feel that we live in a world where so much is possible, except (seemingly) genuinely accepting yourself as you are and not as you can never truly be....however...before I ramble on (any more) I feel a lot of the  transgender viewpoint that I have heard does come from this whole 'female soul trapped' perspective, which I think has coloured my views negatively, as I don't buy it either as a proper concept. I am interested to see your more nuanced view on it and to hear where your motivations for it come from as I think this has definitely given me a better understanding. I definitely couldn't open up myself the way you did here in public, so thank you.   Also, I'm loving the music in this video! Best I have heard on your channel so far. Subscribe! :)
I'm with Blanchard!
Thanks for helping me get over the shame of being who I am
Thank you for this video. I know you seeing this message is a long shot and this not the most articulate thing I could say, but just. Thank you. Really.
It is amazing to me that you are willing to share all of this with us. No sarcasm at all: that was incredibly courageous and generous of you. Also brilliantly executed on all fronts. Damn.
I don’t agree with every single thing contra says but I’m glad she’s like the Ben Shapiro and Steven crowder of the left right now. She’s what the mainstream left needs, she’s lovable, relatable, and very informative and educated. I see so many comments saying that she’s “changed” people which is good.
Ahhhh you are so fucking cute. Great vid, very elucidating, thoughtful, and brave. You opened up and shared yourself with the world at your most vulnerable; you're so kick-ass! I hope you find the love you're looking for. <3
I definitely lean toward the gender critical side but I really appreciate your perspective. If everyone on the trans activist side and gender critical side was able to discuss this stuff as intelligently as you we’d probably be able to make a lot more progress and reach agreement on more issues.
As a cis bisexual woman, much of my arousal is based on the prospect of how men view me. Like in sexual situations I have imagined myself in the perspective of the man and performed in the way that I thought he would like. And I don't think this is the same as fantasizing about women (because that's a fundamentally different feeling to me), but I think it's more about how I've been conditioned to put male desire over my own so much that I've conflated the two and now view men's sexual desire towards me as my own. I know you kind of said this in the video but I've just started to realize this about myself and I don't know how to stop. I'm spending way too much time during sex wondering if I look or sound right or if what I'm doing is pleasurable for the guy, but I don't know how to focus on my own pleasure.
I just like hearing you talk
I realy like your video... And from where I stand, I would be incline to think that those '100%men' witch is their view on it not mine... however, I thiink they get anxious about everything when they are confronted with the idea that some 'men' decided to be 'turn' into 'women'... And that is maybe because they belive that women are those little poor things that have no power, no intelligences, and so on...  For some mesogynic closed minded men... that are relying on stereotypes to find their own identity... anyone who slightly goes off their narrows categories are ... 'm not sure there...:  quite scary??
your skin is sooooooo pretty
Your videos are so interesting (both because of the subject matter and thanks to the humor you bring when addressing these topics) I love that you can unpack these concepts with both a personal touch (that you own up to as part of your view) and a holistic understanding of the issue. Your Incel video got recommended to me a few months ago after I started checking out others on the topic (I avoided it cause I assumed that you were going to have the same glib approach to the subject that everyone seems to bring)   I'm just really happy that you and your channel exist, I guess
What’s the opera piece at the beginning of the video? I can’t find a credit for it.
how dare u imply dogs dont go to heaven ;'(
Leading b list transexual
Oh my... the fuck saw incident.  Definitely Google the fuck saw incident.
the discussion of personal sexual attraction is honestly so affirming here? While as a nonbinary amab trashfire human who has a totally different relationship with my body i definitely don't feel it in the same way, the confusion of "i get off to this" fetish behavior with "i want to be this" mindsets is super relatable.  Basically, thank you for injecting my brain with validation and dopamine.
This video is so god damn incredible, such high quality. Much love for your hard work, Natalie
Do you have any books you can recommend to help me be a better ally? I’m really really enjoying watching my way through your work. Thank you.
I've been reading a lot of TERF stuff lately (not voluntarily, I've just been running into it more and find myself unable to tear my eyes away, like watching a car crash or something) and I've always found issues with the way they present their arguments, but I don't have the specific debate skills nor the energy to refute them myself. Watching this has been enlightening.
In 50 shades of gray, *which i read for research purposes*
I love how UNNECCESARILY dramatic and colorful all these videos are. I feel like I'm watching a Tim Burton movie
These videos are so incredibly helpful, (stretch audio) "as a straight cis man", to understand other folks' experience. Your thorough examination of arguments (not shying away from pretty much anything) are solid. The amount of public self-examination is just remarkable and incredibly brave. Geez. Thanks very much for making these, CP.
Was watching the video and my dad bursts into the room the exact moment the cosmo self love article is on the screen.
i definitely really took in and considered everything you put out there and even if the filth didn't do it for me the few minutes truly hearing your story made me get into less of a mindset of "I can see why this is wrong" to "I can see why this is dehumanizing"  the person is just as important as the argument when it's on the human condition  thank you
This was genuinely interesting. I appreciate your candor.
Thx for the ch in Bach's name :) Klang gut!
Male lust is not inherently "object oriented". There is definitely that aspect to it, varying in intensity from person to person and situation to situation, but calling male lust "object oriented" is defintely a mere shadow of an actual representation of male lust and all its facettes.
Male lust is not inherently "object oriented".
So i'm not saying I'm going to become a patreon... but if I was to become a patreon it would only be because I felt a moral obligation to start sending you child-support checks for our future love-child.
Disclaimer: I'm a little bit very drunk. But I want to let you know that I have never in my life been able to describe the nature of my sexuality so well as you do here( I'm a cisgender bisexual woman). It's so satisfying to hear you describe the difference between the sexualities that you've experienced, and label one as my own. Thank you so so much for that.
✌❤🤖
I owned the book for about ten days.  I read a little bit and thought, sure some of this applies...  then I read further and realized he just like to fuck drag queens in a gay bar. He is absolute garbage as far as science goes and the war to rate his book on Amazon is fun to watch over the years.  It turns out that i do not fit either of his categories in that i qualify in both.  And the paraphelia criteria dont apply to me at all.
I sleep in a bra every night and I’m a cis woman it just makes me feel protected
@11:21 when she says google it, FUCKING GOOGLE IT THAT SHIT WAS WIIIILD! I’m pretty sure him think trans women are pervs might be a bit of projection on his part
Oh hell yeah , i would fuck myself. It was incredibel interesting to watch this Video. I love your Channel, basically bingewatching it since three days . Great Videos you have made  sweet Lady.
Thanks. Love you 💕
how smart you are makes me both very attracted to you and intimidated to the point of trembling hands when i leave a comment, but those characteristics that make you imposing are ones that i trust will make you simply ignore me if i say something stupid. anyways, i lob u.
It's quite amazing to me that we still have to deal with hearing cis white man defining and explaining to the rest of us how we feel and think. Peak mansplaining.
Oh, *that* filth... I thought you meant a rant at Blanchard and Bailey. Well, I'm still here for the science, too!  Seriously though, I don't find it filthy for you to discuss your personal thoughts and feelings, yet that could just be me as an asexual female. It actually was so nice to get to know you, and I really would love to be your friend. Thank you so much for sharing and discussing a very difficult subject (only made more difficult by those ignorant perverts/"researchers")! I hope you've found your path to individual happiness.
in this video you remind me of dona from that 70's show
A maybe not important point: authors very rarely get to choose their own book covers unless they're like, J. K. Rowling, don't have any control over the cover of their book. So, you know, it's not what's-her-face's fault her book cover is boring.
I wanna Fuck u 😉
Petition to get a full version of Time Warp by Contrapoints
Huh. My sexuality is a hybrid of traditionally masculine and traditionally feminine patterns. I'm a cis dude. But the sense of being trusted and wanted is very sexual to me. I cum every day and can get off to pretty well purely physical stuff, but having sex with someone I'm just physically attracted to isn't worth putting much effort in. Aka I'm a virgin who isn't super bothered by it. This is rambly... just know you've made me think about myself. And I can't imagine having enough issues with how others live their lives to tell them they're wrong about who they are.
I low key thought this going to be an ASMR video at the beginning. Woah, I need some sleep...
What if I AM a woman, don’t FEEL like a woman, & get TURNED ON by the IDEA of being a woman? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm?!?!??? 😂😭
The smile she makes when notices the absurdity of: "You just found someone who built a sex robot" Is THE MOST PRECIOUS THING EVAAAR
hold up I lowkey beat my dick to my refection and im not trans?
I'm super inbetween cluster A and B despite being a raging lesbian. I transitioned a couple years ago when I was 14 and I played baseball and videogames with painted nails and art lessons.
Since that clip from Silence of the Lambs keeps appearing, I wanted to mention Dr. Lechter makes a point of telling Clarice that Buffalo Bill ISN'T a true transsexual
And I have to say, I totally agree with your thoughts on being trans concerning the "woman trapped in a man's body" platitude. This idea has always rubbed me the wrong way because it's never really felt like an accurate representation of my own feelings. I often question the root of being gender dysphoric. In the end, whatever biological or social influences being trans stem from, all that really matters is that transitioning makes us feel a hell of a lot better about our lives (for whatever reason that may be).
thanks for putting yourself out there like this, it takes a lot of courage to expose such an integral part of your being to the scrutiny of the youtube masses. It does so much to humanize the trans perspective, and for many of us it's just too great of a personal sacrifice to engage in this kind of conversation. Even talking about trans issues with people can sometimes trigger dysphoria, so I commend you for "taking one for the team" as you put it.
lmao i just googled the fucksaw thing and wish i never had
Also, quick comment, as a/dfab non woman, I used to sleep with bras on- But the reason being I have a large chest and utterly despise the feeling of them just hanging there.
Ok, before I comment anything else, just have to say, you look absolutely on point in this video. Super pretty holy shit. As a nonbinary dfab, or afab, or whatever you want to call it, it was great to look into different view points and compare myself to them as a way to better understand, well, me. I could go on about that, but that's not what we're here for. This is a video about trans women, after all. Tying to bridge the gaps in this way, in laying out experiences and explanations, is so enlightening. Hell, I'll admit, I do sometimes have some of those fears when I meet trans a/dmab people! (Which, I know it's wrong, trust me I feel awful when it happens). But it's that which helps bring some insight into /where/ these ideas come from. Fears. Now, the fears can come from many different places, be it fear from repression of one's self, from the unknown, etc. But fear is far more common in the social sciences than is thought of at first.  I  mean, why even write something like that in the first place, as a scientific study? It all boils down to fear. And the first step into moving past such things is to recognize that. P.S. Thank you for sharing such personal experiences with the internet. It must have been hard to do. You're very brave.
SHE IS VERY VERY FUNNY
you folk can play pretend all you want, it's your right. and the rest of us will show you respect as human beings, but don't expect us to play along with you.
To deny the authenticity of transsexual individuals and the profundity of the transsexual experience is to deny the truth of human sexuality in all of its wonderful expression. Period. It exists at the fundamental. I just don’t understand why people, like Blanchard, have this nasty impulse to fashion these ridiculously isolating and outrageous paradigms. (By the way, Blanchard’s theory is pretty close to invalidating all LGBT+ experience as some vile Greek-cognate-filled bullshit.)
The fucksaw... Wtf? Sounds like the name of an AMAZING death metal band/song.
This video is a classic.
Youtube doesn't deserve you.
I would try to contribute here that the driving factor in me becoming a fairly steadfast ally for Trans people, was something I'm surprised was not mentioned here. When I was in university, I took a course called "human reproductive biology and sexuality" that had a textbook of the same name. In it, it had an entire chapter dedicated to Trans people, and the fMRI scans of their brains. It showed that there were observable and measurable signs in the gray/white matter of the brains of CIS male/female brains, and Trans Male/female brains, and then even showed that there are observable differences in the brains of bis gay/lesbians as well. Although, they did admit that like with most things, those born female as in the cis women, trans men and lesbian categories were inherently more difficult to observe and measure because like in all things, female hormones create changes and variables that are far more complex and difficult to study. However, at the end of the day, the research stated that doctors who knew what to look for were able to reliably sort piles of fMRI scans of various patients who were cis/trans apart into piles fairly consistently based on the differences in the fMRI scans observed in the white/gray matter of the brains which are influenced by hormones.   They theorized that there may be both genetic and environmental factors, but stated that based on current research, that trans people and lesbians look like they're most heavily affected by hormonal changes influenced by environmental factors during gestation.    Long story short, there is research out there that literally shows that Trans people are literally born with the brain resembling on sex born into the bodies of the opposite sex, from birth. So if they want to call it a "female essence born into a male's body", then whatever, but the studies and the fMRI scans I read about in the text book and that we covered in class were pretty straight forward. It's not a "cis female" brain, but reliably identifiable as a trans female brain which is most similar to being "bio female" in morphology. The chromosomes may not match, but the brain developed how it did, and my belief is that we as people are not defined by the bodies we're in, rather, they're just meat suits that our selves (our brains) live in. I think that if tomorrow they magically were able to preform full brain transplants, if I had my brain transplanted into a 60 year old gay man's body, I'd still identify as a cis straight woman in her 20's. I'm sure that a 40 year old straight Cis dude transported into my body wouldn't magically start being attracted to the men I'm attracted to, and they wouldn't start identifying as some female millennial and I'm sure they'd experience a hella lot of dysphoria about it as well.    To quote the asshole "Facts don't care about your feelings", and in a way, that's true. Trans people are their brains, and if their brain tells them that they are this or that sex bc of how their genetics predisposed them to react to environmental factors in the womb that exposed them to differing hormone levels, then dammit, that's who their brain says they are. I don't give a shit what meat suit they wear bc they're going to be who they are regardless, even if their brain is transplanted into a killer whale.    So whatever, why TF do people care so much?
Heya, trans guy here, first time binging your videos today and I can't hold back the gushing any longer.   Good god, you are fuckin' eloquent. And strikingly beautiful. And almost freakishly multi-talented. You put together these educational performance videos, genuinely witty, self aware, relatable, not only mentally stimulating but created with this aesthetically inviting atmosphere, edited so seamlessly the watcher doesn't even fuckin' realize they're watching an almost hour-long video. (Really... I just had to check the length of the vid to know and I nearly surprise-shit myself.)  Listen I don't believe in hero worship (we're all so p r o b l e m a t i c amirite) but if I did, you'd be in the running for my personal Jesus. Since I don't, I'll have to settle for favourite youtuber of all time. Fuckin' subscribed.
i actually do know cis women who sleep with a bra on
So your telling me a large group of people do not conform to some arbitrary framework some guy pulled out of his ass based off of a really small sample size?  Stuff like this is why I often find it hard to lend any credence to psychology as a field of science.
Wait.....what's wrong with fetishism?
This is great, thank you. Also absolutely dying at the Bailey voiceovers :'D
Hey! Cis women who sleep in bra do exist! I suppose that they are all into BDSM.
P.s. I love you Natalie
I’m a nonbinary (?) person with a vagina and stuff I realized just now that autogynophila fits my sexuality more than any other descriptive I’ve ever heard, even though I like dicks on nonmen  I was wondering for years what I should use as a description of my preference for masturbating over any other type of sex I might be a trans man or maybe I’m just a butch lesbian with almost no experience with other cis women- but besides being trash- the other reason I have little experience with the joys of other people’s vaginas 😔 is that I feel alienated by the way lesbians and pan/bi women perceive me as a woman
You are a Lady!!!!
im a cis woman, and I think I started to understand a bit more about my own sexuality thru this video (maybe it sounds odd). I really love your content and how you present it.  I also wanted to add I do sleep with a bra on lol
Plot twist: Blanchard is a closet transsexual.
Wow, I can relate to your story, I would cross dress ironically up to age 10 (I actually was planning to make a video with a friend doing this, but it never panned out), never masturbated until 16 or 17, and the act of ejaculating felt kind of horrible. I hated it. I felt guilty and wrong. Of course that's probably more related to my history of self loathing and depression than anything else, where I basically hate anything I do, and hate even more when I procrastinate on the things I should do.  The difference mainly is I don't think I'm gender dysphoric. To be honest, I couldn't care less about my gender or sexuality. I wear long hair, grow out my beard, wear hair bows (when I don't lose them), ponytails, pigtails, braid my hair, etc., and am endlessly curious about what being a female is like (of course, not enough to go through a no-return process of becoming one). If anything, my entire drive has been curiosity rather than a feeling of not being comfortable with my body.  That being said, I'm still an undergrad, I don't fully understand myself (which is a weird thing to say), and might find out that I've been lying to myself this entire time (although I doubt it on this front).  I appreciate your content and hope you can continue to profit off of it.
11:20 immidiate pause and google.
your "normal mode" look kind of reminds me of lana del rey. you are such a beautiful and talanted woman, and your videos are like very well made short films. we love you, queen!
I'd just like to enter into the history books here that I'm a cis woman, and I also wear a bra to bed.
My sister has always slept in her bra. It makes her more comfortable and feel safe. And my stupid body has the most painful and irregular periods that I truly have debated having a full hysterectomy bc I already can't have a child, so what's the point. I just felt like I should share something after you poured out all that personal information. I appreciate this channel so much.
So, I have some mixed feelings about this. On one hand, I want to think that presenting the arguments in a more objective way should be enough, that we should know how to pay attention and think about this things without all the wrapping, that other topics that not necessarily adapt well to such strategies should also get attention, that we shouldn't need personality cults or sexualization to make political issues cool, and that it's even dangerous. On the other hand, I love the experience of the great presentation, the humor, I have no doubt it's effective, I'm touched by the courage, I feel emotionally involved, I love the channel... I'm binge watching all of it. The only possible conclusion is: 22:02 I'm available ;m;
But you are agp. You’re a straight man with a fetish, not a woman.  50 percent of women are not gay but it’s kinda funny how half of trans “women” are.  You’re just a fetishist, like that freak autumn except less extreme. It’d exhibitionist and you need other people to validate this which is why you scream if people don’t call someone that’s obliviously a man a woman.
Oh no, what happened to your voice?
Thank you for showing me these things your channel rules.
I love you hetero dont give a fuck what anyone thinks ! You are brilliant and beautiful !
The ending song really reminded me of Nina Simone's Stars for some reason
Lots of cis-women sleep in a bra lol. We used to think that it would prevent sagging. But now we know that we need to let the girls out to maintain them
That moment when you find out she's from Belize.
"these shoes are cute, and I'll finally be able to hit my head on the tops of door frames." killed me for 5 minutes, I'm 6' 2" so this is a real thing for me wearing 4" heels.I laughed so hard. Thank you Contra
This is only the second video I've watched of yours and I love your sense of humor. I'm perma subscribed now.
I never thought "Three times a lady" by lionel richie could make me cry, but I guess it just takes a supportive trans woman singing it.  Or maybe it's just the hormones.
And until you can love yourself, I will be here loving at least your youtube personality <3
You've made me think about my life a lot. Thank you.         I love you
I absolutely adore this video--not the fact that a fucking backwards and honestly disgusting theory like this exists, but the fact that you, Contra, so eloquently, passionately, and brilliantly put the theory down by calling out its bullshit on both a scientific and societal level.  Also, ten bucks says Bailey subscribes to a lot of Freudian theory. Just a hunch.
...I googled it. Well worth pausing to facepalm at the breadth and depth of this man's stupidity.
I have a lot of respect for this piece. That takes an incredible amount of courage. Way beyond anything that I have ever even contemplated doing. Subscribed.
you're just really, really, bloody good at this stuff. thanks for existing :)
I enjoy my body odor :>
Fuck me I learnt a LOT from this video Big thancc Natalie
Gay man here. As in very attracted to men and very turned off by women (no offense intended).   I get offers from "straight" men often enough. Funny that. I'm not a lumberjack, true. But I am obviously male. What is up with that?  Also, very, very uninterested in feminine clothing, lifestyles, anatomy. I like being a dude. I love having a dick. It's not exceptional but it is mine. The idea that I could get more dudes by taking on an identity I just couldn't pull off is actually infuriating. Besides, I don't seem to need that kind of "help". And at what cost? Of the 'nads I actually want to have? Absolutely not.  So it seems clear to me that to give up a self for an other is not reasonable. To want to change the self is a heavy thing and not something to barter with. Why would anyone presume that anyone would want to change themselves, especially something as pervasive as their gender, just to get laid?  Perhaps there are people who could. But I wouldn't want to and wouldn't presume others would by default.  I would be broken and ruined by warping who I am just to attain some sort of goal. And I would fight to the death anything that would try to warp me.  But I am not everyone. So what of other people and what they have taught me about their experiences?  Every trans person I have ever met has had a struggle over identity -- a fight to be their true self. And what kind of persons they took home after this war had no direct correlation to any of this.  Just a bit of convesation, observation, and introspection is all that is necessary. Mind, it's all made needlessly painful because of cowardice and social toxicity.  I'm annoyed that someone (Blanchard) actually  got published professionally to hallucinate an explanation to phenomena he wasn't personally comfortable with because of his own insecurites and character defects.  Thank you for elucidating this. And keep on being wonderful. Your tenacity and honesty are noble and appreciated.
Thanks for this video. It is bang on the mark in calling out bad science with an agenda.
How dare you 16:10
What's the name of that opera song in the beginning? Btw you're gorgeous Natalie
I’m an autofeliphile. Autoailurophile? Fuck, I don’t know.
Thank you for the great video! As a cis woman, I very much enjoyed this dissection of these bizarre theories on female sexuality. I also thought I could throw in a contribution to your question on whether your experience of sexuality as a woman who is trans is very different from mine as a woman who is cis (the part you said you couldn't actually speak to). The answer is no, a lot of what you were saying completely resonated with me as a cis woman. So with that said, I want to add a second underline to why comparing trans women's sexuality to cis men's is baseless.
20:40 ish ROPE FUEL AND INSPIRATION AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS FOR A SEVERELY DISTURBED CREATURE THANKS CONTRAPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOINTS
For what it's worth... The first of the videos I watched (The one on Incels) my initial assumption was that you were a Cis-Woman until you revealed part way though the video you were not... and like River Song getting to know The Doctor in reverse it blew me away when I finally came around to some of your older videos when you were a Twink... It was like Youtube Content Provider Disphoria. I really REALLY have come to enjoy your commentary, intellectual honestly and in this video personal honesty and I find you attractive as a woman... Keep up the great work, I have been thoroughly entertained and educated and I love your video style!
27:53 Thanks for not judging me for my walrusophilia.
Man... I haven't watched Milo and Otis in forever.
The comment about how conservative professors being "silenced" don't usually see any meaningful disruption of their career or research is a good one. If we contrast that with left-wing professors like Steven Salaita who, since publicly criticizing the Israeli government on Twitter has lost his job, we see what academic censorship actually looks like. Additionally, the fact that all of these edgelord academics lot like neo-Nazis who say they're oppressed becase people disagree with them is telling.
Ok someone tell me about the fuck saw, I don’t want to look it up
i feel enlightened!
"real women do not wear fishnets and garter belts and corsets" umm...speak for your fucking self bitch
I love the way you talk about being aroused by more interpersonal connections, and I've never thought of that but it speaks to me SO MUCH.
Your smile/laugh is so pretty !
I've met terfs that have said basically the same shit Blanchard did hmmmmm
Beautiful. Thank you for sharing your heart with us.
I would buy your audio book for Fifty Shades, side commentary and all
i just realized there is so much i didn't, and still don't know about. thank you for informing the public, seriously, i didn't know being trans was much more than the "female spirit in a man's body" and vise versa . i heard that once and just, accepted it not knowing any better.  Also i think l learned about myself? i just really enjoyed this video and all videos you do really. (they're so visually appealing and well informed)
thanks
<3
This video has really high production values
Thank you for taking on the emotional labor of making this video (and all of your videos). I appreciate you, your candor, and your journey.
The "F*cksaw Incident" - https://jezebel.com/northwesterns-fucksaw-sex-class-gets-axed-30816563
*FUCK* , THE MUSIC IN THIS ONE *SLAPS* SourPls SourPls SourPls
There's a weird parallel between his "science" and the "historical" accounts of native American culture produced by white men
"Autogynophile Harry Plinkett." God speed, you majestic memer.
...... I sleep in a bra. 🤣
The sockpuppets in this comment section are comically bad. One of the many red flags about trans ideology is the online Scientology like tactics.
KUDOS!!! Beautiful, nimble and eloquent gazelle-like reasoning agility!
Well... this is awkward.  I identify as a gay man who has occasionally lamented being male because being a straight female would make being effeminate and androphilic okay. And I would *totally* fuck me. I wouldn't even hesitate to fuck me if I got the chance because I already know that I want to fuck me, too. So... hi, to my homo trans sisters, maybe?  I've honestly never even heard of Bailey or this theory before (I admit, not being trans didn't lend itself to being super interested in the trans experience), so it's always weird and also comforting, in a way, to hear theories about things I've experienced and didn't know were things others have experienced. Kind of makes me not feel alone, even though I recognize Bailey's theory is problematic. But even here, you admit the theory is less problematic in terms of being universally wrong than being used lazily to misrepresent a diverse set of experiences within the trans community.  I was especially interested in how you described the way estrogen treatments changed your sexuality from obligate orgasming and visual cues to optional orgasming and interpersonal cues. I've been entertaining the idea that I'm asexual because almost all my sexual encounters with men have started out really arousing due to the recognition that I'm desirable to a man, and the intimacy and kissing were really arousing, but when it came down to the actual sex part, I always felt really turned off and like I was faking it to fulfill the obligation of making him orgasm. I wonder how much of that has to do with hormones and how much is linked to female psychology, as I might be looking into either testosterone or estrogen treatments depending on which side of that I fall on, haha.  There are a lot of other parts of my gender and sexuality that I've been toying around with insofar as possibly being trans. I've never felt like I was a woman in a man's body, but I've also never really felt a strong connection to being a man, either. Lots to think about here. Thanks!
You don't think dogs go to heaven but heaven is the most perfect palace and have you met dogs they're the best so if heaven doesn't have dogs I'd rather go to hell
The reason no one calls female born women autogynophiles, is because fantasizing about being your bio gender when you have sex is not a paraphilia, it's what most people do. It seems like you're confusing autogynophilia with anything autoerotic. Autogynophilia/Autoandrophilia refer to people who get turned on by fantasizing about themselves being the opposite sex, so a woman can't be an autogynophile.
it's amazing what "scientists" can invent to prevent people from transitioning, by shaming their identity and feelings.
me at the start of the video:why would you look at someone and think that they're perverts first before thinking the logical thing which is that they like women's fashion and think its cute me when you read the book excerpt: oh that's why
What is a "trans woman"? Do you believe there should be defined restrictions on who can legitimately call themself a "trans woman"? Should they have to have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria?  Be on hormones? For how long? Wear "women's clothes"? How is that not perpetuating sexist stereotypes? What about Danielle Muscato, Alex Drummond etc?  What about "trans women" who don't actually suffer dysphoria and are quite happy with their penises and testicles etc.? Do they not count? According to some, a penis on a trans "woman" is female anyway...  You seem to equate "trans woman" with "someone with sex specific body dysphoria"  but isn't that policing the gender of others who don't experience "gender" or sex the way you do?  Plenty of people identifying as trans women absolutely are fetishists, including autogynephiles, and others still are just opportunist.  Do you believe society should try to distinguish? If so, how? And if not, what do you say to service providers and other organisations responsible for safeguarding e.g. women in prisons, women escaping intimate partner violence, or accessing rape crisis services, homeless shelters, overnight sleeping accommodation on transport, in hostels and so on? Women who don't want to share facilities with men who claim to be women when they're getting changed at the gym? Should they just suck it up? Are they just bigots in your opinion?  Rachel Mckinnon? Perfectly fair contest?? Is the woman who should have taken 2nd place in that championship just a bigot who "hates trans people"?
Julia Serano hahahahahahahahah
"I don't wanna be whistled at by somebody who would whistle at somebody who looks like me" that's... incredibly honest, self depreciating and bitingly sarcastic
You destroyed me when you said "cis feminists identify with witches" i didnt ask for this kind of analysis  With that said, thank you for this discussion. I found it extremely enlightening.
Настільки чинно. Шкода, що в нашій країні подібні теми геть поза будь-якими дискурсами, навіть ідеологічними чи академічними. Вельми вшанований Вашим розглядом цієї проблеми. Надіюся на подібні цікаві речі з Вашого каналу. (Just in case, it is Ukrainian. So do translate it, please...so much fun to learn some language)
I do get off by looking myself at the mirror. But I am a gay man.
Brand new to this channel and already I'm loving it (you).   It's true, what they say, that his heart grew three sizes that day.  <3
I come watching your every video with attiude "this is going to be some SJW bullshit" but then before it ends I completely agree and leave a like ;)
You should get a Nobel Peace Prize
Hi - cis woman here - I sleep in a bra
The way the parentheticals are read at 7:28 is the voice acting choice of the fucking year
thank you so much <3
idk does it even matter why people want to transition? i really don't care just do what you want. crazy idea right?
This is the entire problem with "psychological theories." While they might go far in  explaining things from a clinical point of view, the demand from a theorist that their theory is "correct", it just doesn't work that way. Some trans women may be autogynephile, but, so what? How many biowomen fantasize about being raped? does that mean their entire normal "cis gender" experience is really defined by this fantasy? Maybe autogynephiles are turned on by themselves as female simply because they subconsciously want to be who they really are. That's absolutely a valid explanation (aka theory) for the trans/genderdysphorio/wanna-be-a-woman phenomena. its certainly as good an explanation as blanchard's hypothesis.   Every philosophical theory I've read, read about, read described has a whole army of counter opposition. most of these arguments are defined by the holes in the offending theory. So, when I took psychology and philosophy, the one thing that occured to me was "if this (the theory in question) is what we are supposedly supposed to be defining our future practice by, how is it that there are so many professional, peer base opposers out there? Shouldn't we be basing our clinical practice on something that has mostly universal agreement? But alas, every single philosophical and psychological theory that under grads are learning are riddled with holes. it seems all psychology and philosophy courses should start with a class titled "disclaimer."
Honestly, this took guts and educated me.  You should be proud
When you said “crate and barrel catalog” I laughed so hard I subscribed
when you said something like “transguys and nb folks can sit back with their beers” i literally snorted because im transmasc and nb
I love this. I love you.
I am ftm trans. I feel so disconnected from my (pretty bangin hot) female body that if I wear female clothing I feel a strange sense of autogynephilia. It's sometimes fun to roleplay as a girl. I don't understand why. It would be awesome to pick your brain and discuss it with you because you have essentially the opposite point of view.
Ah I love this channel. That was extremely informative and edifying. Thank you.
Cis woman here reporting for duty! I came here cos of Philosophy Tubes video on transphobhia. Ive never been a TERF but I wanted to face what kernel of transphobhia I had (or the spore as he put it).  I'm really greatful for this video that is helping me face this and challenge some beliefs that I didn't know I had and didn't know we're harmful.  This is making me a more considerate person.  And that's not nothing.  It's never the oppresseds job to educate their opperssers.  So I am always really thankful when someone is willing to come forward and speak about their experiences, lord knows I would never do it. Anyway  Thank you, you thoughtful and incredible woman!!!!
Hooray, you date women. I've got a shot!
Take a shot every time she says women
Would this suggest I have a traditionally male sexual appetite? I am extremely hypersexual, with a mostly visual and paraphernalia based attraction and I can care less about interpersonal connection.  I mean I love my fiancee but that ain't why I fuck her,  yknow? Perhaps its attached to my personal history as an almost inevitable repeated victim of sexual assault. I hear that causes many people to become hypersexual or have a warped sense of their sexuality.
"I don't wanna be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me."  Awwwww :(
And to reiterate, no one ever talks about transgender men or nonbinary peeps.  In fact my keyboard keeps trying to correct the term nonbinary. I would love just once to hear about my experiences being torn to shreds too. But people don't even see me. Even when discussions of nonbinary people do exist,  its only about white androgynous AFABs who teeter between being cute femme transboys and agender androgynes. I want someone who looks like me,  who feels like me.  Is that selfish? Probably.
No one has ever characterized my experience of sexuality so bluntly and absolutely correctly. I really appreciate your insight.
I found this incredibly elucidating.  "The useful platitudes become a problem when more analytically minded people start putting these things under the microscope."  That's me. And the frustrating part is that I'm a far left SJW, and I want to advocate for the trans community, but I haven't been convinced that gender exists outside of biology, society and language. Which means that when I advocate for trans people, it gives me cognitive dissonance. I am, as I often say, desperate to convince myself that gender identity is a real thing.  Describing your experiences also reminded me of myself. I did enjoy being feminized by my female peers in high school and college, and I also experienced a degree of autophilia in which I imagined myself to be female, especially in my teen years before my bone structure had become as masculine as it is now. And I distinctly remember being disappointed when I realized that I couldn't convincingly cross-dress anymore because my shoulders had gotten so broad that I looked like a cross-dressing man (a joke) instead of a woman. This happened in college, for Rocky Horror.  Something else happened for me though. I always thought of myself as feminine, but when women in college started to respond to me as a masculine male, I found that it put me at ease. For example, when a woman rested her head on my chest and placed her hand on my arm - there was something about that that affirmed my (dubious to me) masculinity and maleness that made me feel at ease with myself. In a way I guess you could say that I had a degree of gender dysphoria because I wanted to feel more like a man, but actually felt more like a woman; but that dysphoria was easily cured by intimate/romantic interactions with women.  I think that understanding being trans purely in terms of gender dysphoria is helpful for me in terms of soothing my own cognitive dissonance. When you say that being treated as a man triggers dysphoria for you, I can respect that, and I am moved to ease your suffering. On the other hand, there will always be some analytical part of my mind that won't accept that you are a woman. Because man and woman are biological descriptors, which language serves, and which society gets completely wrong (abolish all gender roles). That said, I have no problem treating trans-women as women, because I know that it makes them feel better about themselves (not to mention, in your case, that I probably wouldn't clock you anyway).  Who knows if anyone will take the time to read this random YouTube comment...for whatever reason this topic is very close to me and always on my mind...so maybe this comment is more to take the opportunity to sort out my thoughts than anything.
love this video, LOVE YOU. I think your comments on cis female sexuality is pretty spot-on. I think though that the conflation of female sexuality with economic needs is... well it can be problematic, but I think it's also a reflection of how we are in many ways LIKE cis men but expressing it differently, as our economic focus is much like theirs in that they too, place power at the center of much of their sexual thought (if one can also conflate economic opportunity with power, as I really think it is at least in Capitalist societies such as ours). Also john berger's book is fucking insufferable, though his commentary on women in western art is really interesting (if short-sighted).
And I love you...Thanks so much
i just googled the fuck saw incident and i regret it
For just "so many years" I slept in a bra to retain those things.  I wasn't the only one.  There's so much going on here, and I know there's so much going on in our transition, but this is a semi-normal thing.   You are worthwhile.

I was not aware you were trans, in a previous video you referred to yourself as a man who liked to wear dresses, so I just assumed you were a man who liked to wear dresses. So are you planning to/already have become a woman who likes to wear dresses? And or were you a woman, who became a man who liked to wear dresses?  None of these questions matter.  I do feel like autogynophilia is a possible stance, but definitely not even a primary one. I feel like creatures are much more complex than that.  My initial assumption was just that you were a woman. I feel like the term trans is unhelpful. You are a man, a woman, a person, or something else, what you were before is totally irrelevant, and what you are now only matters to your sexual partners.
also you are a women worthy of love <3 i have intelliect crush if it helps
great interesting I enjoyed that as a nonbinary i'm just out in this "theory" lol
the prison number was originally 6655321 in the book :)
due to youtube autoplay i heared this video right after the Genderqueer video from the year before which is an intresting contrast comparing those two
You are doing amazing work. I've read Serano but you really captured a lot of great detail and emotion that her work does not go into. Thank you for this. 💜💙💚💙💜💚💙
I'm a middle-aged trans woman (Cluster B) and I appreciate this video. A lot.
completely unrelated, but you have incredible teeth hahaha
I'm a straight cis guy and I gotta say my version of sexuality is somewhere 50% in between the 'broad-strokes' cis-male and cis-female sexualities. I am definitely attracted to the female body on its own, and I feel the need to masturbate regularly, but not THAT much. I need deep emotional and intellectual connection (or at least the illusion thereof) in order to really enjoy anything connected to sex (either real or simulated). The desire to be wanted is, I think, a huge drive for many (most?) people I know.
"queer men" e_____e
I've slept in a bra since I was 19 and that's why as a 45 year old my tits are not polishing my shoes...pay attention teens!
I'm afab and nb. And I'm interested in non masculine identified people or masculine aesthetics in general. Tumblr calls it neptunic. (People love saying it's woke anti amab stuff. But my partner is a non transitioning amab nb so at least that inform how you think of it)   And I do have quite a bit of areas of dysphoria. But I also find myself particularly attractive as I am now, and especially before I got fat. So I'm scared to do anything to transition. I've always wondered if that's autogynophilia, but like more legit than it gets used against amab trans people.   Tbh most areas of dysphoria can't really change. Or not from hrt alone. Chest, genitals, body type, cheekbones, voice, height.   Tbh I got fat trying to change my body type to stop being so small and feminine. It didn't work well and only heightened my issues. So that might be why I'm a bit scared of just turning ugly.
I find the parts about women's sexuality extra interesting, as it was my complete inability to relate to that that really made me realize that I was a gay trans man. I find women's descriptions of what makes men attractive completely foreign to me, and fanfiction written by women (whether or not it's f/m or m/m) boring and unrelatable. However, I really heavily relate to gay cis men's descriptions of their sexuality and find erotic writing by gay cis men actually, well, erotic.  My relating more to gay cis men than straight women has only intensified on testosterone.   There was a lot of really great points on your side, and I loved the trans-specific humor you have. Its refreshing to hear someone joke about trans stuff in a inoffensive way!
You know, subtract most of the sexual stuff (I identity as asexual for the most part), and your story seems very similar to my recent coming out. I'm so glad I found your channel; you've helped me considerably in accepting myself.
Please date me 💛
I just stumbled upon this video and I'm doing a Frank n Furter costume for Halloween, lol. Is it appropriation when I'm a cis woman? I'm just a really big fan of Rocky Horror.
I will never get over how amazing her lighting always is
You make amazing content, thank you so much for making these videos. It must have been difficult to expose these details about yourself. You really helped me understand your perspective, and I believe that it will help reduce this stigma. Thanks again for being so courageous.
I don't get why most people "simply are not up to having" philosophical discussions
Was that Gamrax's "Falcon the hero" narrating?
i find it so funny every time someone comes up with a theory about trans women being the hypersexual deviants. like, if they were talking about people in the "sissy" community who use feminization as degradation and only in a sexual context then it might make some small semblance of sense, but with trans people? as a trans male myself, let me say that trans guys after getting testosterone into their system are the hypersexual ones.  also, the idea that trans women are only transitioning for some sort of kinky sexual satisfaction seems to be an evolution of a male view on female sexuality. middle ages were that a sexually appealing and active woman was a witch enchanting men. then that the women were insatiably lustful and copulating with demons. then let's not forget penis envy.
I like you a lot !  Your wit  and your truth  ! Thanks for being part of this  world  beautifull .
You're amazing.
Hey Contra, I come at this from a kind of odd perspective. As a young trans man, there's a weird sense of relating to some of this while standing completely outside of a lot of it. However, I still want to thank you for being so open about your trans experience. Even though most of it doesn't apply to me personally, I can relate to a lot of the anxieties about gender expressed in this video. I did recently find a person who can love me the way I want to be seen, even though I can't transition the way I want to, and I truly hope for you to find that same love. Sincerely, a dude who really loves your vids <3
<3  : )
commenting just one point of the video: female sexuality and mechanisms of arousal are vastly different than male. To me as a (very average in my mind) woman that's clear. Yet why doesn't the majority of the media seem to realize that? All I hear is that in reality women want sex as much men do and as men do - a woman who doesn't is somehow broken and needs to get fixed... or she is at least unconsciously oppressed. When the sex life of a couple has receded - bring toys into the bedroom and watch porn together (a tip that might work for men). Even the few women who claim to make porn for women or feminist porn mimic the mainstream heterosexual male porn industry adding just a bit of variance in the body types of the models and lengthening the foreplay BECAUSE THE WOMYN LIKE IT. I am confused.   Apologies for any awkwardiness or mistakes in my text, english is not my first language.   Needless to say a wonderful video.
Coming to this late, but wanted to say it's a very good video, well made and well argued, although when you said that bit about not wanting to age into the body of an old man, part of me wanted to take you aside and tell you there are easier ways of avoiding male pattern baldness than... well... this.
thank you for sharing.
as a gay trans guy, ive had people call me a fujoshi, straight girl, and even "auto-homo-eroticist", which was apparently what blanchard calls us...
You're beautiful, and I mean it, PERIOD! :)
I have to say thanks for being open about your experiences and reasoning for transitioning. That's incredibly rare (most of the time I just see/hear the typical bullshit narrative). And ultimately I was sitting here wtfing the whole time. Both at the AGP descriptions, as well as at your experiences and history.  Ultimately it's just reaffirmed my view on there being two distinct disorders, even if I can recognize that neither are AGP.
Hi. I'm from the gender critical school of thought.  I appreciate and admire your vulnerability in making this video. And, I don't think this level of vulnerability would be necessary for the formation of more ideological understanding between terfy types and most trans women.  I actually arrived at this gender critical stance because I was 100% unquestionably on board with trans ideology and was trying to disprove someone else who was saying it was bullshit, but all I found was the gender essentialist woo and then this theory of cluster A and cluster B trans people. I would happily look into other systems of analysis because you're right, the autogynephile theory has holes like swiss cheese and fails to fully appreciate the experiences of people, but it's the only theory out there running counter to the narrative that says cis and trans women are literally the same and you're a bigot for asking questions.
“The only reason trans women would transition is so they could get off! So says me, straight cis man!”
you are my new hero. i think this is my second youtube comment ever. i think my first one was on another one of your videos. i just,  think you're fucking great. that is all.
I cam definitely relate to your descriptio  of sexuality. I believe it's much more correct than the autogenyphilic one. And I really like your videos!!!
"I don't wanna be whistled at by the kind of person who'd whistle at me." You're just all kinds of awesome.  (Btw, I have a cis-woman friend who sometimes sleeps in her bra during summer.)
I think "Women aren't typically turned on merely by the thought of being a women" is disrespectful towards Shania Twain
I can’t handle how much I adore your videos. This one is just another amazing example. You are so creative and articulate and compassionate. Thank you 🙏🏼 I admire the shit out of you❤️
As a person who has had 3 long term relationships with transwomen, I find Blanchard's thoughts utterly reprehensible. I had heard of this theory, but not who was responsible for it. Good to know that it's this dude named Blanchard.
0:26 OJ MY GOODNESS IM READING THAT BOOK RN
A straight and or pseudo bisexual man who transition to quench their perversion of crossdressing and going after lesbians. You autogynephiliacs are filthy and do not compare to the homosexual variety.
Finally got around to actually watching Contrapoints’ video on autogynephilia, a concept that has especially plagued queer trans women for decades. And all in all, I  agree with her conclusions. Great work!
True question now : why does this lamp look like a butt ?
Sometimes I forget these characters you do are all the same person
Can definitely relate to "demonic posetion" sentiment regarding pre-HRT sex drive.
;w; why did you tell me to google the fucksaw incident?
I appreciate this video - I considered myself an autogynephile. I repressed concern I was a trans woman for many years simply as a "fetish." This video (with others you've made) was helpful in tearing down some of these self defense mechanisms I'd constructed around myself. Thank you for helping me accept I am a woman, I'm looking forward to living honestly with myself.
Homosexual transsexual vs. autogynophallic = Blaire White Vs. Riley J Dennis
cis-het dude here. And you're amazing. Love you. Keep doing what you're doing. Emotional and you help me understand both my trans and my women friends in different ways.
As a cis woman I just wanted to say that I really appreciate and applaud your choice in wallpaper.
I'm a cis woman and I can say corsets are a pretty regular part of my life. Hell for a while there waist trainers were really mainstream as well and probably still are. I understand how it can be fetishized but really, corsets where created to help support and mold the body into what ever shape was fashionable and viewed as feminine at the time. Just like body shapers like Spanx do. If it makes you more comfortable in your skin, rock it!
girl you are completely whistle worthy. Catcalling is gross and sad but i think they'd be mad not to think you're a honey
I'm so *confused* .  I mean, it's a good video don't get me wrong. I just feel like I need to watch this _multiple_ times to truly "get" everything that's going on.
I sleep in a bra don’t worry
Ugh your videos are amazing <3
can i just say ur really pretty??? love ur vids <3
your voice is super relaxing
This makes the second video that I've seen and I'm even more impressed by your point of view and how well you stated your points.  I'll admit, I know incredibly little about the trans experience, but have been curious of how it is, purely out of curiosity and some interest in the notion of accepting trans people into my circle of sexual appreciation, you notably being a hallmark of currently because of your eloquence and shear courage to put yourself out there like this to aid those of us that simply don't understand the trans experience.  Which, I admit, I fear I'll never be able to as much as I'd wish, but your videos that I recently encountered have answered many questions about the lifestyle that I've had, and I applaud and revere you for it. So, again, thanks for the upload, and thanks for daring to take it so personally.  It's truly appreciated.  While the first video I watched was amazing and effectively forced me to subscribble to your channel, I believe ringing that little bell is in order now!  Oh ho ho!  *Posh maniacal laughter followed by an awkward silence*  I digress, again, without the context I probably wouldn't see you as trans if I met you in public.  Heck, I didn't even notice until you spelled it out for me in the middle of the first video that I watched.  While I may simply feign a sort density in not realizing it on my own, that's simply how I saw you.  If anything, I hope that it makes you feel good or at least gives you a chuckle about a dense maybe-not-so-cis kinda white guy.  Anyway, a wonderful thought-provoking video, I really enjoyed it.
Yes I do want to have sex as a walrus
reading about the fuck saw incident was a magical journey thank you
43:05  ROFLMAOOOO OKAY I admit I'm a bit of a TERF and that part  is totally true  that was me at 14 back in 2004  XD
I found this channel completely by chance and I'm so glad I did.
The set up with the Bailey's Irish Cream at the beginning killed me.
I love the hell out of this video. My experiences are largely similar to your own, though maybe not on such a scale since I began transition at 19 and hadn’t been to more than a year at college, but I did go through the, and I hesitate to call it cross dressing because I adhere to the brain structure and genetics theory so I believe that at least neurologically even then I was more similar to a cis woman than a cis man, but I did go through the “crossdressing” phase for nearly ten years, and it’s only as puberty advanced and I began to notice more male secondary sexual characteristics developing did my dysphoria get frighteningly bad. (I also tried to audition for dr. Frank-n-Furter but I had to work that night so it never happened x.x).  Autogynophilia always seemed to me to be a pathologization of misrepresented female sexuality specifically from the perspective of a trans woman in an effort to make us appear fake and dishonest. In addition to the theory being reckless and dangerous to us, I can’t seem to think how supposedly self respecting academics can adhere to this theory with its ridiculously bad practices as a study in general.  As an aside, I fucking love your humor. I may just have to make off with a few stolen personality traits >>
Óh girl have I been sleeping with a bra on before... xD When they started growing I basiclally never took my bra off, because my boobs felt so strange and huge and I was uncomfortable without a bra...so yea cis women do sometimes wear bras to bed because they can't sleep otherwise. At least that is my experience. :D
First of all, I just want to say I'm so glad you were willing to share this with us. It's really helped me be more sensitive and understanding of transgender issues, something I've been wanting to understand better for a long time. And second, I'm not sure if this helps or not, but I'm a cisgender woman, and I always (like 99.9% of the time) wear a bra to sleep.   Stay awesome Natalie! You're an inspiration. :)
43:00 this kinda reminds me, when a friends started transitioning the first thought that came into my head when I saw her was somethibg along the lines “she is dressed as if we were teens”
This is what intellectual activism looks like, she really put herself out here for the benefit of others
omg the evanescence scene hit me like a knife ahaha
You are the most beautiful person I've ever seen. I wish you could see yourself as fucking awesome as we do! <3
I know it is not the main focus of this video, but your description of female sexual attraction finally made me realize that, as a woman, my attraction to other women is not the same as male heterosexuality, and having a more interpersonal attraction instead of a visual one is normal. Thank you for making me stop doubting my already confusing bisexuality.
I'm a cis woman and up until a month or two ago I slept in  bra....
Hello, bisexual drunk man here. Gotta give you credit, Natalie, you seem to have a better understanding of what your sexuality than I do. I'm envious, especially being four years older and having to look at myself as a 33 year old, rather than "still in my 20's". It's at this point in my comment, I'm no longer aware of what I set out to say, so...you're awesome.
You are a sophisicated pervert. I'm so happy that i'm not the only one... How can you be beautiful, funny, smart AND full-time perv. Marry me....!
As a bi lady, no. The naked male body isn't an instant get off. I need to have a bond with him first, then when you hit the bedroom, yes, I can enjoy it, but I wouldn't say it arouses me. I need more.. the package. Where as the female form is more beautiful.
It rubs the lotion on it's skin..
I’m addicted to watching your videos, you’re my favourite philosopher and I really appreciate the nuanced arguments you present and the context you provide, to me a cisgirl. Thank you so much!
Minute 14:16 I fall in love.
I FIND OUT LATER THAT SHE IS FROM BELIZE  that fucking ended me
thanks for this <3
Hi, cis-woman here. For a long time, I had very private ideas about trans women which sort of veered heavily into TERF territory. I hated this, because I recognized myself as being just another person who denied trans women entry into female spaces. But on the other hand, I also felt as though my understanding of my own oppression was based heavily on the experience I had as a cis-female throughout childhood and into my adulthood. It felt bad when people who didn't have to undergo that oppression made their way into "my" space, or especially criticized "my" movements. (I'm thinking specifically of the backlash against the Women's March and its trans-exclusionary slant.)  I never explored these ideas with people because I wanted to be seen as a good, intersectional feminist, and I recognized my own beliefs as being very hurtful. So what ended up happening is that my ideas remained problematic and perhaps most frustratingly, unchallenged. I told myself that it was enough that I would never intentionally misgender someone and I continued on with my problematic mindset.  All of this is to say that watching your videos has been enlightening to say the least. I came here for the anti-capitalist propaganda but stayed because I was learning valuable things about a marginalized identity that I had some very misguided ideas about, and because I learned the error of my ways.  I understand now that my oppression-olympics was a form a gatekeeping that hurts my cause more than it helps, and that thinking about a trans-woman as a man who became a woman was fundamentally missing the point, and denying their lived experience.   Anyway, this long comment is my confession that I had really terrible ideas, and my expressed gratitude that your candor and bravery to be so open in this public space has allowed me to grow into a better person.   Thank you so much, Natalie. Much love and support from a new (and still learning) ally. <3
*whistles* Damn this was A LOT and so beautifully well-spoken and intelligent 😭 I’m new to your channel and loving it!❤️
Goddd you're so beautiful. Swing back to the taco train the lezzeis need you!
*burns off fingers googling “fucksaw incident”* oh shiiiiiit 😂
I mean, aren't all women (especially cis women) socialised into connecting erotic feelings with being wanted by men rather than being active in wanting someone else? Society has certainly warped my mind in that direction. It starts as early as with fairy tales, after all. Women are supposed to be passive and desirable. Men want the women and take action in order to "get" them. I'm cis, but if wanting to be desired as a woman makes one an autogynephile, then I suppose I've been one all along. The more you know. 😑  This whole hypothesis (it barely deserves to be called that) is so weird to me. The fact that trans women have normal female sexual desires means that they cannot, in fact, be "real" women? This feels like a manifestation of that old reliable societal fear of female sexuality. Women are not supposed to "want". Desire is not female, but instead surely a sign of sexual perversion. The whole idea is built on an inherently misogynist assumption, but while it's hard to systematically disqualify the gender identity of cis women because of their desires, trans women are of course already in a position where they are constantly forced to prove that they are not men, and every single thing that they do will then obviously be judged more unfairly. Isn't misogyny fun?
"MAYBE I WANT TO BECOME MY MOTHER SO I CAN FUCK MY FATHER" Freuds opinion on trans women
Wow, your perspective was very enlightening to hear. I had heard about this “theory” before but had never never know enough about it to make an informed opinion on it. Thank you for sharing this even though it was very hard for you. I’m sure there are plenty of people out there that are also grateful for you sharing your story. :)
Id fuck you 😎
Your testemony is the single strongest point in my mind that makes me believe that trans people are for real. As a person from Bulgaria, where all of them are opressed.
Call bullshit on this video. No way you can drink that much baileys in one sitting and not get diarrhea.
I feel you. Thanks!
Hello! I’ve found a trans woman that built a sex robot, so therefore I am an expert on all trans women
I'm not qualified to speak about anything regarding the trans experience, but I just wanted to say doing what you do takes a lot of courage. I appreciate you taking the time to do it, and the new perspectives it exposes me to. Take care!
I'm a cis asexual woman and I actually related somewhat to the idea of autogynephilia. Not that I want to fuck myself, cuz I don't, but I do find myself extremely enticing, beautiful, and yes sexy. As an asexual I don't crave sexual interaction but I do still crave 'SENSUAL' interaction, e.g. hugs, kisses, cuddles, etc. (PSA not all asexuals want sensual affection, some do some don't, and the extent to which asexuals and aromantics want sensual affection ranges from hand holding to intense foreplay and wanting different levels of sensual affection does not contribute to your sexual or romantic orientation). So, if you only apply autogynephilia to sensual affection and not sexual, I totally get it. This is absolutely not representative of all or even most asexual people, I'm just a bit individual and in love with myself and if there was a clone of myself here with me I'm pretty sure we'd lock eyes, say "finally, oh how I've missed you" and start making out on my bed shamelessly.
I Googled the fucksaw. I should not have Googled the fucksaw.
You go girl!!! Loving all your vids!!!
I love you.  I mean, not that way- uh, I mean... uh.  Good video, thanks for making it!
I just realized your whole mood is the clockwork orange
Aesthetics:  On point
... i am a void. #nihilism #nolifesmatter
As a cis woman who hates being told what women think and feel by cis het men, I can't possibly imagine the frustration of having an entire field of men telling you that you fit under 2 categories of sexually-motivated depravity :<
love how you make your videos. my sister's best friend recommended your channel and im not dissappointed at all  also, i fell in love with your smile at 14:16 #notasstraightasithought  EDIT: finished video, want to hug you till the world is a better place
I’m becoming a big fan of yours, as a gay man I always thought I was sympathetic enough with other members of the LGBTQ community but watching yourself expose all that personal information about your sexuality made me realize I’m still deeply ignorant (most of my friends are gay men after all). You are right, a lot of cis people like me are cheering this effort of yours and I hope trans people will eventually appreciate it too.
what is known in the trans community as a "JOKE" -- killed me lmfao
you look and sound like a man
16:22 oh shit
Autogynephilia is definitely a thing. But I don't think it's a thing that necessarily has much to do with being trans.  Why do I say that? Well, because I would say that autogynephilia is as good a description as any to describe my own kink/fetish/fantasy. I am a bi cis guy and I love crossdressing, lingerie makes me feel sexy, and I absolutely fantasize about the idea of being fucked as a woman. What I don't do is identify as a woman outside of sexual fantasies, want to live as a woman or transition to become one. Being trans is a complete life identity, not a sexual fetish. But that does not mean that a fetish of oneself as a woman doesn't exist as an entirely separate thing.
Wishing that there were multiple like buttons for me to press... if you know what I mean lol. The blunt dialogue is refreshing
hot take: the people who have never masturbated to a photo of themselves, even just once, are the weird ones
Thank you so much for sharing your perspective and I'm so sorry there are trash people in the world who made speaking about your experiences even harder. Christ, it's not like self-examination (and then displaying that self-examination) isn't one of the hardest human activities even before you consider others' reactions.
You've made a nearly 50 minute video on a topic I knew absolutely nothing about both intensely immersive and entertaining all at once. You're literally the biggest WOKE icon I've ever seen. Keep being fantastic.
Oy, Contra. Everyone who's Catholic believes dogs go to heaven. Pope Francis literally made it our fucking RELIGIOUS CANON. I'm not even joking.
Honestly, at this point, I think I can describe ContraPoints as a half-mad Socialist trans woman who had a realization that to form the ultimate idea, you must combine aesthetics and morals in the perfect quantity, and i'm fairly certain they'd accept that. Honestly, hanging over this whole community, despite the constant jokes and mockery of absurd ideas, there's just this air of, well... Disillusionment, for lack of a better word. Despair. Borderline hopelessness.
As a cis woman, I sleep with a bra on
I know this is a delayed comment. I look you up every once in a while to see who you're doing... but, as a cis woman, I'm just lettin you know I have slept with a bra on multiple times (mostly in my teenage years, to validate myself to myself lol) SO YOU'RE NOT THAT WEIRD, GUUUUUURL  Also just wanna say that, even though I don't always agree with your political commentary, or would agree with you more if you included other points, I actually somehow like you. Especially with the skits you do sometimes. Your channel is fun, even if it's not what I usually look at....
Steven Crowder needs a lesson
So isn't this Autogynephilia thing a fetish?? How has that anything to do with trans people?? This is just weird.
definitely had to Google "fucksaw incident".  just from reading one of bailey's statements I get a distinct whiff of duesche.
awesome video! really dug the music!
Theory: Blanchard is a Pseudoscience-Spewing Jackass. If he does not deny this theory, that confirms that he is indeed a Pseudoscience-Spewing Jackass. If he denies this theory, he is lying and therefore indeed a Pseudoscience-Spewing Jackass. A similar theory can be seen with Bailey, of course.
i like the pink and blue chairoscuro
As a straight dude you have given me alot of insight into the POV of a trans person. Kudos to you for showing some vunerability. I can now say that I understand the dilemma you face a little better. And I am a rather strong minded person so I think you have made quite the a accomplishment here.   However my analytical side is still going to pose the devil's advocate answer that, even if you feel like a woman you cannot be considered one unless your genitals/biology matched. My discrepancies are with that alone.   As a straight guy who has been approached by trans who are clearly not women it is rather creepy and awkward. Some even have the audacity to claim that its sexist/racist to not give them a chance, which I dont understand at all. Sorry, but dress/makeup will not trick my biology.   With that said I will say however that I no longer see an issue with considering a trans a woman. You've opened my mind, even if it is just a little bit so congratulations.
Thank you so much for this video Contra! Upon realizing that I personally identify with the lived romantic and sexual experiences of both men and women, I have finally come to the conclusion that my bisexuality allows me to tap into a greater spectrum of human condition, thus making me objectively superior to both the homo- and heterosexual. I have now decided—since bisexual people are better lovers, empaths, and overall representatives for the positives of humanity—that it is in the interest of me, my children, and indeed the whole human race, to restructure society, putting an emphasis on the superiority of the bisexual. Join be my bi-thren and together we can forge a better tomorrow in the image of our great lord Omnifutuaos, God of bisexuality!   Humanity is at the dawn of a new era Contra, and your video is the catalyst of it all.
Damn, you're intelligent, witty and beautiful. My lesbian arse would marry you if you weren't straight.
I think you're a very intelligent and thoughtful person. As a boomer I like miliienials-I have friends who are millennial's and I own two myself. I have managed to come to a more fulsome understanding of transsexuals because of your videos. However and this may be petty but I do object to being assigned the prefix "cis" because I happen to agree with my genetic heritage. It sounds like some sort of disease. I think you folks who are attempting to carve our a separate definition of womanhood or manhood to adopt this unpleasant sounding prefix. We were here first. The species survival depends on us, not you. I have a different set of thoughts on this set of perspectives. I wonder if men (XY) were allowed more latitude of expression in the presentation of masculinity that the need to appropriate the outward behavioral characters of women (xx) wouldn't be necessary. Our roles are severely truncated and desperately need to be expanded to include the full spectrum of our humanity. Any thoughts?
Appreciate this so much in the ways already mentioned 🙌🏻
What gets me about "autogynephilia" is that... being aroused by imagining an "ideal" version of yourself just seems normal to me? Not just aroused by dressing certain ways or having certain features (as mentioned: diiiick pics) and seeing yourself as worthy of attraction, but imagining yourself as what you subconsciously see as a more perfect idea of yourself. I experience some arousal whem i imagine myself as working out more and getting buff, or even being handsomer than i see myself as now. But that's not a mental illness when i experience it and it doesn't invalidate anything about myself. I mean if i did what would it even invalidate? The fact that that kind of relatively normal experience (as far as I'm aware, maybe I'm just unusual) has been weaponized in bigotry so severely blows my mind. I mean it doesn't blow my mind because i know bigots be petty but still. Like even if it DID have anything to do with the trans experience at large, that shouldn't matter. You say that there's probably no cis women who are aroused simply by the idea of being a woman... but i feel like it shouldn't be about if cis people feel arousal *towards being their gender* specifically, because i don't really see how *certain* "autogynephillic" trans women's experiences differs from any cis person being aroused by imagining themselves as how they want to look. I've also known cis women who were attracted towards imagining themselves as looking different. I can't say if it was sexual for them because they didn't say but it certainly wasn't platonic. But the affirmation in seeing yourself how you want to be is just arousing, at least for me. Just that the shape that takes depends on who and what a person idealizes themself as, and how far that idealization is from how they currently look. (I started typing this comment when i was pretty early in the video so I'm not trying to talk over you or anything when you do speak on those subjects, i just empathize a lot with the trans women who label themselves as "autogynephillic" or who see aspects of their experiences in the label, because to me it just seems like my experience put into a different circumstance just when i experience it it isn't weaponized against me, and when cis women i know experience similar things it isn't weaponized against them)
"i do it because i need to feel something (god anything) taking up space on my chest" oh my gosh i feel that on a very deep emotional level like... ouch
ugh your mind is so powerful
Your honesty is truly, truly admirable.  You're the only non/quasi-celebrity openly trans-person I know. Maybe it's bigoted of me to think that I can avoid/prevent being transphobic by watching your vids. But I'm going to go ahead and congratulate myself for trying. :P
Just wanted to say thank you for the super informative, but more importantly, deeply humanizing explications on these various, matters pertaining to transgender identity and expression, matters that are of obvious importance in social discourse concerning trans identity, albeit it's a discussion which comes, as you explain, at some considerable emotional cost and a slight-to-significant risk of personal injury.  Which is truly regretful, since it's those with the highest authority to speak on the matter that stand the most to lose or gain from it.  Therein lies a danger that a conspiracy of silence might be imposed, such that the messages  received from the dominant culture are those that encourage or coerce our ignorance and conformity, to the degree that the most vulnerable members of society are the least likely to speak up (or are just ignored or futher diminished when they do).  It's in the spirit of these concerns that I have tried to make myself an ally for trans community, if not by contribution to more overt or "official" channels of activism, I attempt to in my own small way in the course of interpersonal interactions, arguing their case as best I can (admittedly, with often very little information at my disposal, I've relied on earnest attempts to appeal to a person's humanity and on hypothetical scenarios that invite empathy for the other by casting them in the role in their imagination.  But while I came to this video already a supporter of LGBTQ rights, as a cis white male in the South, I've had pretty limited personal interaction with trans men or women,  Your video, and really your channel as a whole, has really helped me to more fully empathize with and better understand  the challenges, joys, fears and dreams that for better or worse, apt to deeply affect trans people, both as individuals and as a community alike.  Of course, your personal story isn't necessarily typical anymore than you intend to represent all trans people everywhere (nor would I, for my part, claim to understand every trans issue or all aspects of trans experience).  And yet, in a very concrete and beautiful way, I feel that a greater potential for a much deeper and more fully dimensioned capacity for caring and compassion for trans people and their experiences has opened up within myself, merely by coming to know a bit about you (at least, of this  to-some-degree-mediated version of you).  And for that, I'm really appreciative.  Again, I am cis white and male, and I'm probably not the target demo for this video by far.  I would guess it would resonates far more with those at similar points in life undergoing similar events,  or with minorities of any kind who are likely to identify more readily than I. Then I figured it might be nice to hear from a cis white male with a precisely different tone of voice and intention than the insufferable alt-light fuck boys you mentioned in the video near the end (who probably all have the hots for you, despite their bigotry,  not that they should have any reason not to, granted.  cuz at the risk of, I dunno, being a dick and a creep who's disrespectful of your boundaries and your value as a human being, I think  you're pretty hot too, on top of having a wickedly sharp wit and enviable grasp of a multitude of advanced philosophical concepts, and other concepts besides.)   Anyways, fuuuuck this is so damn long.  Fuck it I'll just say thanks once more, and leave it be.
You're not alone in sleeping in a bra. I have a ton of cis friends who wear bras when they sleep, some because they have boobs that hurt when they roll over, and others because it just feels more comfortable.
Oh wow, I didn't realize that was Peter Coffin before. I was suddenly very confused during the excerpt reading scene, when I thought that the detractor voice sounded an awful lot like Armored Skeptic!
God your hair is on fleek.
i just Watched this video while playing Whammer 40k: space marines, this was one bizzar expirence. well anyway keep up the good fight
HSTS's are Neotenuis, even without HRT.  Dr. Harry Benjamin's HSTS's had Hypogonadism, which can lead to Hypogenitalism.   With HSTS's, the thought of using their weewee to pleasure a female is repulsive.  Even as boys, straight males can show Interest in HSTS's, as their drawn in by their femininity.
Why can't whatever you are just be known as bi, and how you dress be how you like to dress. And how you act be how you act. It's almost like the hormone thing is disconnected from that, and reads more like a chemical romance.
It's your sweeping generalizations of the preferences and habits of ciswomen that ought to assure you that your transition (is that still the acceptable term?) is progressing swimmingly. Enlightening work
(26:55) As a woman who is attracted to woman without any hormone therapy (or dysphoria) in the mix, I not only am really into the physical and not really turned on by emotional or kind of vague stuff like you described (I did have experiences like that when I was first exploring my sexuality however) but I do orgasm like, daily (though I wouldn't associate it with a need of some kind) and it is when thinking about women bodies. I also have a lot of fetishes around woman. So.. is that normal? Is this typical, or is Natalie right about normal female sexuality? I guess my questions is, do woman other than me feel that way about their sexuality, or am I an outlier..
its not really scientific research, no tests were done, and no data was gathered, and there was no peer review. It's not science its just some wack-jobs idea of how trans people work, which is obviously ignorant and wrong to anyone who knows anything about trans people. Real scientists don't get behind things that don't have evidence behind it, so no one is calling it science, science is only interested in being objective and not being biased, so white men's ideas aren't calling themselves science, you are pointing to a particular white mans ideas and calling it science, because he called it science, without wondering if its actually science at all. If you had a study done by someone in the scientific community who was respected that would be  different story, but it would also be impossible, because science doesn't change, science is the study of nature, and no white man will ever be able to impress their view on the laws of nature onto science unless they somehow manipulate the data, which is something that science accounts for with peer review. Also if they were to do this they would no longer be a credible scientists, just like this guy isn't a credible scientists, therefore calling his ideas science is giving them more credence than anyone in the scientific community EVER would. tdlr NO ONE CALLS THIS WHITE MANS VIEWS SCIENCE BECAUSE ITS NOT FUCKING SCIENCE. 2 PEOPLE HE MET IN A BAR IS NOT A SAMPLE SIZE OF TEST SUBJECTS NO ONE WITH AN OUNCE OF CREDIBILITY IN SCIENCE WOULD EVER REGARD IT AS SUCH STOP PRETENDING LIKE ANYONE GIVES CREDENCE TO THESE IDEAS BUT BIGOTS
John Berger for the win! He was the best!
I am a woman but i feel like my sex drive is higher than any man i have met. But i suppose there are exceptions to every rule. I have noticed men love this but are shocked and intimidated.
I am also a straight white cis dude who has watched this video and... I'm in awe of the bravery you've shown putting yourself out there, seriously. You're awesome and I'm excited for you that you managed to overcome so many things and go on the road to becoming yourself. :)  I have to say... hearing about your struggles inevitably made me reflect on myself as well and the fact that I feel broken as a sexual being. It's too long and... probably not the place for me to elaborate on that, but I'll just say I really appreciate hearing your perspective and experiences and I feel like I may have to consider some things I haven't really... or tried not to consider before. Thank you.  EDIT: Wow I just realized how dark that sounded. Considering things about myself! I swear I didn't mean anything about harming myself. Christ.
I know I'm late to this video but...omg.   You, my dear, are amazing.  Thank you for content like this.
I thought this was gonna be about people attracted to cars
lastly, I want to point out that autophilia *exists in cis people!* I have an ex who constantly fantasized about fucking himself or fucking a clone of himself. He found the idea hot af. He loved dick, he loved having a dick, he wanted to fuck dicks, especially his own. He also loved vagina, so it wasn't some exclusive homosexuality thing. And he was cis. And I mention a man but I'm sure it doesn't only happen in men. Autophilia is a paraphilia that can exist without trans desires at all.
another aside: as a trans man I find the idea of autogynephilia laughable. It's essentially a dressed up, gender-flipped version of Freud's theory of penis envy. And that's what I'd reply if someone used the argument against me that I have some kind of sexual attraction to having a penis. The rest of Freud's work has been largely discredited as completely ascientific, why would we cling to the "penis envy" shit too? These theories came from the age when psychological theories were introspective and not analytical. Some straight man looked inside himself, thought genderswap porn was kinda hot, and reasoned that clearly, that's how trans people work. It wasn't science when Freud did it and it isn't science now.
This is I think is most definitely your best video to date.
8:05 I find it telling that Bailey had to assert that he was heterosexual in the same breath as asserting that this trans woman he was lusting after was actually a gay man. that's some gymnastics.
your videos are such a perfect mix between a video dissertation on a controversial topic and self-deprecating humor. a fucking blessing, honestly
Let's be honest, Bailey is just salty and almost comically perverted. He feels threatened by a state of being which he could never fully understand and upset by the fact that none of these trans-women will ever be nearly as interested in him as he seems to be in them and overly critical of the ones he doesn't deem "screwable" enough. If anyone is in a 'narcissistic' rage here....  Also ascribing a condition or sexual orientation onto an aspect of what many people experience as part their normal sexuality seems over-scrutinizing at best or else horribly misrepresentational. As a woman, I'm often turned on by the thought of me, as a woman, as I'm almost absolutely positive many men are the same to themselves. Does that make us vain? perverted? To love ourselves in a sensual way as we'd love our lovers?  After watching this video I became curious as to just what r/gendercritical actually was and did some digging and I. Regret. It! Sooo much hate directed towards the wrong groups (as if directing hatred was ever a progressive part of the movement.)
50shades of grey is a ayn randian fantasy
It's 7am here and I never went to bed last nite, so excuse me if you brought this up in the video, but one of the great ironies in the adoption of Blanchard's theory by TERFs is that Blanchard's failure in his autogynephilia theory is due to him trying to understand female sexuality through the lens of his own male sexuality and failing miserably. This is the exact thing radical feminists should despise about him and his theory, but conveniently overlook because the theory bodes well for their preconceived notions about trans women.
This is fucking brilliant and you got me, "Why can't more trans women explain the cause and their condition more eloquently and directly in the way you have?" This is some of the best material I have ever seen of gender identity. I'm going to call it! Your the next Ellen Degeneres. The character that destroys all of the hate and fear stereotypes with their authenticity, and fucking hell, is just to adorable for the old guard to be willing to throw away.  Ellen was kicked off of her show for being gay, but ultimately it turned out that we loved Ellen more than we feared gays and so we had to give up on hating them. Ellen and Rosie had basically the same platform from which to work from, but one furthered the cause while the other has probably held it back. Its all about the approach. Your fighting the good fight, but more importantly your doing it the right way. You've made a believer out of me.
I'm a gender critical trans ally (read into this what you will) and I really appreciate this video. Autogynephilia  struck me as an inaccurate representation of most trans women's experience. I'm glad to have run across your articulate critique. And the message is easier to hear because it's not dressed in gender essentialism.
My name is Kim and the reading from The Man that would be Queen was so uncomfortable to listen :')
I'm here after reading Galileo's Middle Finger and Listening to Jesse Singal on the Tea for Two Podcast.  https://soundcloud.com/user-761174326/03-jesse-singal  Dreger did not give the impression that she believes Blanchard's theory. She also raised many of the tone deafness points  raised here. The main difference with Dreger on Blanchard is that she doesn't project bad motives (e.g. not pursuing truth, continually derisive, cruel). To me, he is like Robin Hanson - an extreme decontextualizer and systemizer that ignores cultural norms and the way they will be received.   Having said I all, I enjoyed this vid and learnt things. Jesse even recommended your channel on that podcast despite you guys fighting in public.
I leave one comment about being a closeted trans woman and this video consistently sits at the top of my recommended.  Still can't bring myself to watch it bc I'm dealing with enough institutional transphobia atm anyways
Am I really the only cis female who sleeps in a bra?
This is a whole fucking study in gender and sexuality and pure biochemistry. I'm gonna cite you in my thesis when I finally achieve my dream of becoming a revolutionary psychiatrist/sexologist
Contrapoints feature film OH FUCK YESSS
Im a cis white male and as such I am an ardent "SJEW". Your typical libertarian socialist. I am currently studying anthropology, and its amazing to me how these anti trans and anti feminists completely miss the cultural side of things. Native Americans celebrated trans people. They were considered something of an ultimate spiritual being (ok, thats a bit of an exaggeration but doesnt change how celebrated it was to be trans). These people were seen as "blessed" to have the best of both worlds. Then you have all of Margret Mead's works.   Humans are animals. We are animals with an advanced intelligence (probably due to the evolutionary advantage of teaching our young). All humans are something like 99.95% the same. I think something about this fact scares many of these "academics and skeptics". We need to understand this to celebrate that .05% change.  On a personal note, when my wife and I are having sex, I gain a lot of pleasure from making her feel good. I was a virgin until I met her. I crossdressed once and wasnt into it. I on occasion see how intense the experience is for her and I wonder what thats like. I have always had a bdsm fetish. It was original a dominanve thing I think until I realized the true pleasure came from forcing her to feel good and relaxed (she is a sexual assault victim from multiple people, so always had a confused idea of sex and pleasure and would make her uncomfortable but its changed thanks to the love and passion we have). Sometimes, I do wonder what thats like to feel and experience as a woman. Its never more then that and I dont want to be a woman. Which brings me to wonder, is that an issue that these people have? Do they have a fetish like that or are they afraid of their own gender and that they have transgender thoughts?  I dont know and I know this is rambly but... I needed to get it out, because, well... Fuck these people.
What I understand autogynephilia they get aroused by fantasizing about women they like and wanting to feel they are inside her body??
WHY IS THERE NOTHING I CAN IDENTIFY WITH
A platinum fireplace is one of the most needlessly stupid and ostentatious displays of wealth I have ever heard of especially considering the fact that almost nobody would ever even recognize that it was a metal as stupidly expensive as platinum. I want it so badly
masterpiece
I was expecting a fidelio reference!
This made me hawny. I'm off to look at myself in a mirror and rub lipstick all over my face. Tis the only reason I transitioned!
Thanks for the trans trigger warning. Really needed that today
The male voice reading passages from Bailey's book, isn't it Falcon from Gameranx?
This is so well done I could cry
yet, the autogyne smile really is a thing. Also. self-objectification. "i want someone to fuck me". Don't you, you know, want to fuck someone? Sex is normally a participation sport. oh, and very brave to go there in the trial.
If this is true, then why are there more male trans than female? Maybe you and Blanchard are both right to certain extents.. there are just many different types of people who transition but he described two prominent ones. Don't get me wrong. I know androgynes, I'm related to one, they are all different but honestly that thing you said about bdsm tells me you really are a woman I dunno how to explain that
Going through the Contra backlog and I finally watched this and holy shit it is amazing. I am so grateful that she made this. Honestly floored that she would choose to be so vulnerable.
You probably won’t see this, but isn’t it kind of bad to imply that autogynephilia is caused by the testosterone, and that trans women all go on hormones to get rid of this feeling? As far as I know as a newly minted trans-woman myself there are trans women who choose not to go on hormones and that this doesn’t affect the validity of their trans-ness it feels like you’re disagreeing with that here idk though.
You are the best!  I could say more, but I'll leave it at that for now.  Thank you for being so awesomely yourself!
Not that my opinion is the most important thing ever, but this is, to date, your best work.
Holy shit, Contra completely and easily explained female sexuality in a way I don't think I've realized whole-heartedly myself.  You'd have to be stupid to think she's not a woman, if not by birth.  And yes, I definitely only sleep in a bra only if A) I was too tired to take it off or B) I'm concerned about somebody I don't want seeing my tits seeing my tits.   Well, essentially.  If I DO sleep in a bra it is likely to be in my least bra-like bra; my favorite VS sports bra, which is almost imperceptible. Probably most likely for convenience when rising to go pee and not having to dress to do so, or for warmth, just like the majority of times I sleep in pajamas. It has to be very damn cold or pajamas have to be feeling very damn excessive amounts of cloth for comfort for me to do this.  They're not typically comfortable, and like wearing panties when sleeping, it's not good for you/ advised by health professionals.  I have on several occasions worn a dress during the day, and in lieu of nakedness or pajamas for whatever reason, taken off the bra (and the panties), put the dress back on and went to sleep.
transfeminine nonbinary person here and ur braver than any us marine
Fantastic video and presentation.  More than that and the eloquence you have on the subject matter being discussed, I wanted to give you love and support for how much courage and fortitude it takes to dive so deeply personal, all while knowing you will be put under the scrutiny lens by dehumanizing trashgoblins out there.  I admire that.  I admire you for doing this channel.
It is an amazing talent and skill that you can talk about autogynephilia for 50 goddamn minutes and be entertaining, funny, and charming while also managing to be intellectually rigorous and surprisingly emotionally vulnerable. You amaze me.
Hate TERFs, Love ContraPoints
Why do you people always bring up Silence of the Lambs?  The movie clearly states Buffalo Bill isn’t trans.
29:36 holy shit. Like this is making me look back on my younger days and how I engaged with porn (or wrote it lol) and it falls far more in line with porn created by Cis men. This is... damn. Such news for me. (I’m finding that as a trans man I’m learning a lot about myself watching your videos, like holy shit.)
7:06 I TRIED to read The Man Who Would Be Queen, oh god did I try, but I wasn’t even to chapter 3 before I wanted to fucking burn the book. Now I know why it was so disgusting...
This video is incredibly amazing, she is incredibly amazing and articulated in a way I wish I could even dream to be. I'm actually pissed about the fact that I can only like this video once.
Wow. Contrapoints is just such a babe.
Dost thou bleed?
As someone who has seen many hookers I'd rather choose one that's less hot and I connect with.
I started loosing my shit at the rocky horror part, also you’re so hot and smart like honestly how are you real??
This video is so amazing.
Hi. Can someone explain something to me?  If sex is biological, and gender is constructed, then all we mean by gender is the behaviors and experiences that are socially defined as masculine and feminine, right?  So let's say we have male A, who is very feminine, and identifies as a man. And male B, who is very feminine, and identifies as a woman. What is the difference between A and B?  Because if the only distinction we are drawing is the choice to self-identify as a woman, that would make being transgender a choice. And I know that's not what people think. So what else is it?  Please just believe me that I'm asking this question in good faith out of a desire to better understand this. I'm not trying to offend anyone.
The Blanchard/Bailey model can't even conceive of gay trans men like me.
i was eddy once
can i be autoandrophiliac?
A polished video by and about a really confused man. This person is arguing logically based on a false premise. His real identity is clear: (1) the five o'clock shadow on the upper lip, and (2) the very wide shoulders and a hard jaw-line, as you would expect in a fit young man, when wearing his "Rocky Horror" costume.   I do hope, for his sake, that he wakes up one day before he is totally isolated.
I want to see her debate Ben Shapiro or Jordan Peterson!! Let's put our best up against theirs!
I’m not into women... but damn you’re hot
I heard about autogynephilia on the internet and I was skeptical about trans people, luckily a classmate in my sex ed class gave me the link, and it cleared misconceptions in my head and made me realize that autogynephilia is bullshit
LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAAAAAAIIIIIIIN! god dammit, that song is going to be stuck in my head for a week dear god help me save my mind oh god fuck fuck fuck....  i hope you're happy for my suffering... also, great video contra
This is not how science works. Blanchard’s “theory” has no empirical backing. Sure what can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. I appreciate your correlation clusters, but both you and many other intellectuals are way out of line trying to claim that you can define social phenomena. You can’t argue “truth” from the vantage point you have chosen. The phenomena we observe from men, homosexuals, women, etc. all have to do with tradition and competition. Both of which I firmly reject, because it’s all a show. You can color and dress and call yourself how you like, that doesn’t change how I behave or how I choose to use certain pronouns.
Bah, have my subscribe, you filthy person!
........ What is the opposite of being attached to your own body? Autophobia? (Super informative and wonderful video.)
Youre something else!!!  Fantastic  I wrote this long before i even got to the "filth part"  PS: does me loving my own dick make me autogynophiliac?
I am a cis woman who slept with a bra until my late twenties.
Why on earth are you using footage of Buffalo Bill, who even in the movie was presented as not genuinely transsexual as an example? He started making himself a woman suit after being denied sex assignment because he was mental not trans. Even the " Butcher of Plainfield" Ed Gein who really made himself a woman skin (lamp, seatcovers, candleholders, etc.) was never considered by anyone as trans. The psychology at work is an obsessive hatred of women who remind him of an overbearing, usually religious, shaming figure coupled with an inadequate and weak or absent father. That is unrelated. I'd expect YOU of all people to get that right! Let me spell it out simply. Neither Ed Gein nor the fictional characters based on him were gender dysphoric. Ed Gein did not want to be a woman. He wanted to kill his mother in order to assume her power and role as dominant in the household. He perceived himself as vastly inferior to the Perfection that was Mother. This is not what trans people are or think or do. End of complaint. May I add that until this moment I've never seen anything to disagree with in any of your videos and I have watched a half dozen of them. My teenage son independently discovered them and we both love you.
I'm a cis woman and I wear a bra in my sleep. I love you.
"it's effectively a straight, cis man announcing his discovery that young straight chicks are hotter than middle-aged lesbians" honestly this is the best and most concise way anybody could summarize that book, thank you so much
Yo, I am in love with the aesthetics on this channel
11:21, I did, and I hate you right now, my 15 year old eyes did not need to read that shit, or know it existed
You are so brave.  This world does not deserve you.
>Ray Blanchard is still alive >and still active on Twitter to this day  god damnit
I wholeheartedly agree with everything you say, but what about Chris-chan?
17:01 So... What exactly do women do differently to men at grocery stores, on planes and at dinners? I mean... you use different bathrooms, but there really doesn't seem to be any difference in how you are expected to behave beyond that.
it's really more of a hospital gown
I couldn't ever, even a million years, ever be anything approaching this open to a YouTube audience. Hell, I can barely be that honest with just myself. Great video.
Arghh stop making me question my gender identity... I was happy thinking I was cis, what have you done to me?
I am a mostly a straight female. I would love to clone my self and have sex with myself. I am attracted to my own body, what ever bisexual feelings I have for other female bodies are probably an extension for this. What sort of a pervert am I then? People need to quit judging others based on theif own standards.
this is going to sound very weird, but I wish you were my mom haha
Breathtaking courage and truth. But not just truthy truths. Actual facts and science shit too. And jokes. Impressive. I didn't know what paraphilia meant. Now that explains that weird stuff in my youth.   Testosterone does kinda emerge as a strong demonic possession (never thought of it so simply) but for a cis male it feels definitely like *your* personal demon. Especially at around 13-15. A lot to consider here. I appreciate the effort and sacrifice.
The disclosure of your personal experiences has now opened me up to the hidden terror that I am perhaps unhappy with my own physicality.
I once had a woman tell me she went home with me partly because she noticed I didnt try to drag home some random chick every night like my male friends would try to do. I just thought it was a nice thing to say. Didnt realize the insight into the female perspective I was being given at the time. Thanks for that. Both of you ladies.
I feel conflicted by this video, because while I feel it offers some very interesting insight and options for comparison (as someone who has experimented with crossdressing and struggled with thoughts of am I trans, or is this... autogynephilia, I guess? Although I'm not particularly interested in dignifying that term by treating it seriously given what I've seen of Bailey/Blanchard, and besides that there are differences... there are always differences, I guess), at the same time I feel uncomfortable with this sort of public picking apart of someone as a person and their most private experiences. I have experienced a certain amount of regret at the fact that you felt the need to put this much of yourself out there, that's not something that anyone should have to do. Having said that, if it makes you feel better at all, I do think that have your experiences as presented here to compare and contrast has helped me sort through at least some parts of my own addled, self-destructive brain.  So thank you, Contrapoints, and please do not do this to yourself again!
Blanchard and Bailey's shitty trans theory reminds me of the Earth-centrist theory.  "Everything revolves about the Earth!" "But what about retrograde motion?" "The planets travel on circles that orbit the Earth!" "That still doesn't explain all of the anomalies you can see-" "Just add more circles!"  I mean the circle math still worked for predicting the paths of celestial bodies but it was way over complicated. (And also wrong.)   I find it interesting that Blanchard and Bailey over complicate their theory in the same way while still calling transwomen who disagree with them liars. I also find it interesting that an argument I hear a lot against anyone who isn't cis is "you're just over complicating things!" 😒 Yes. _We're_ over complicating things.
Mmmmm, that Symphonie Fantastique 5th movement
hey as a cis woman i also wear a bra to sleep albeit, a sports bra, it just feels weird otherwise. also i love ur neon lighting
Holy shit the end of this video legit made me cry.
awesome video, I am converted to contrapoints now. :D No, just a fellow trans gurl. But on a note: Never forget, that In 50Shades Christian is an abuser and it has nothing to do with real BDSM.
Alright so coming back to this seven months later and there's still not a sex robot in Contrapoints and frankly I'm disappointed
The voice acting is impeccable
am i gay if i know the opening song
"tha-- you jus---- you just found a person who *built a sex robot*
Cis woman here. I sleep in a bra. That's often the only clothing I wear to sleep. We might need to rest our weak human bodies, but gravity? She never sleeps. ps I also don't have a uterus and I am still young enough to realistically be fertile so yeah. People who proclaim that an entire group of people looks or acts a single way are full of shit!
MAKE AUTOGYNOPHILIC HARRY PLINKETT REAL!!!
love u so much
This is awful to find out about.. I always thought transgenderism and 'autogynephilia' were entirely unrelated things. One being genuinely a conflict within one's identity and the other basically just a sexual fetish. But I had no clue it was a theory trying to explain away the former as being just a pretense of the latter. I still believe there's people out there who simply get off to dressing/looking/acting feminine, who have no interest in transitioning and should never be conflated with those who suffer from dysphoria, but I don't feel alright calling them 'autogynephilic' anymore
Dude sexuality is complex
I've been binge watching your channel lately, and I really love your humor, intelligence, and insight. This was an interesting topic to me, I do however bristle at the term "female sexuality". I have never fit that script as a cis het woman. I have a high sex drive, am very much turned on by visuals, and while I'm very discrimininating about partners I have zero fantasies about that. If I'm in "sexytime" mode it's just going to be sexual scenarios flashing in my head, not glasses or fireplaces or whatever. That is completely alien to me. One thing that makes human sexuality so difficult to understand is that there isn't a way yet divised to separate socialized sexual scripts from what may be innate without that influence. Anyway, thanks for making me laugh and think!
Does anyone know the name of the classical/opera song she uses in a couple of the clips?
God. I don't know what to do at all.
Also ending up being attracted to men more due to testosterone makes me want to kill myself. Male sexuality is honestly... disgusting. I feel bad for everyone involved on both sides. You are biologically forced to objectify someone else. I can see myself committing suicide over it without ever being able to have the correct parts to deal with it.
Thank God for this. For multiple reasons. Its a perfect explanation that I needed and also as a trans man I've been afraid of Blanchard's theories being true in regards to me even though he doesnt believe in autoandrophilia. I dont know how to exist within space and it makes me fear I'm making a mistake even though I hate being female. I could provably explain my dysphoria with that theory tied with my inability to handle sexism or maneuver as a woman in a way that makes me happy and wanting to be attractive to women. I just think it wasn't fucking fair that I had to be born this way and I dont want to be a woman. It disgusts me in a way that is ruining my life. However how you described your experience sounds EXACTLY like mine which is validating... but strange. I like the idea of people being attracted to my body and I feel women do feel that way with men they just dont know how to, but the way men look at me and interact with me is unsatisfying and empty. There is nothing pleasurable to be gained there even if I like the idea of men, at least beautiful and androgynous or feminine ones who don't view me as anything different from them. I wonder if we both actually just desire the exact same thing... and transition is clunky and rough but the only way I can think to get it. Genuinely, I wish everyone was androgynous.. maybe more feminine in some ways but somehow had the ability to play both sexual roles (and feel it) and would actively play both romantic roles in society. It hurts me to my core that that's not the case. The fact that the male srs surgery is basically worthless in my opinion makes me feel like there is nothing I can do to handle this dysphoria and there is no hope for a genuinely fulfilling sex life and as I am I feel less than human.
You are so beautiful it actually physically hurts.  I hope you realize that more and more.
I love this vid, but please, Natalie, get different music.
remember that time that Bailey (allegedly) slept with one of his research subjects for that book (For the non-academics out there, that's considered, like, super unethical)
So I really liked this, and I agree with your claims over all, but one thing bugged me:   Claiming than men are visually aroused while women are emotionally aroused is kind of plays into the whole 'Venus-Mars' thing. I'm pretty sure I've read (lots and lots of) research that contradicts these findings. It feels like a potentially damaging sweeping generalization to make about how cis *or* trans women experience their sexualities. You shouldn't have to rely on that argument to disprove the autogynophilia theory; women should be *allowed* to like visual porn and masturbate often without having their gender called into question.
In my perfect world everyone would find their own body attractive and sexy, without any reductionist trans-phobic bullshit attached :)
also, your voice singing reminds me of nina simone... love it too
I love you
@45:42 I promise!
Googles "Michael Bailey fuck song" before realising I misheard your accent and almost died inside.  I might bust out my Dewalt tonight and blast my arse, see what happens.
this whole theory feels so misogynistic, it's somewhat ironic. it's like trans women pass for him without him even realising. the way he's treating the backlash of trans women like hysteria. also the whole idea of deciding about a woman's sexual need without actually doing scientific studies or actually listening to their opinions. like, from a cis woman's perspective that guy has about as much insight as some sad incel on reddit that nobody should listen to, but humanity is like that sometimes, so welcome to the party i guess? but also, i'm occasionally turned on by being a woman. and i know at least one other cis woman that feels similar. like maybe that's not common, but i dare say it's not all that uncommon when i can talk to others about it and they go 'aah, same'? what he's talking about is such a grand heap of bullshit i don't even know what else to say. except your point about witches is pretty accurate. oh and also my best friend sleeps in a bra since we're 13 and she's absolutely cis, so normal is a myth. that's about 14 years of bra sleeping i'd like to add.
as a transwoman (ignore the deadname plz, it's still early for me), i came to your channel looking for ...basically a bit of representation, and because i was searching for voices i could relate to and... for lack of a better word "idolize" (though i've never viewed anyone as a flawless human being, so my idolization is much more... detached than it seems to be for most people - like, i used to regard Yahtzee Croshaw in this way even though i *vehemently* disagreed with a lot of his opinions on social justice. sort of... "i realize this person has flaws, and i'm not going to ignore or defend them, but they otherwise make good stuff that makes me happy" and probably because that was my first internet celebrity, it's kind of how i approach all internet celebrities now) the way i used to be able to unquestioningly relate to male YouTubers like the Vlogbrothers and Tom Scott. as i normally do with a new channel, i scrolled through the back log and started with the earliest listed video ...of course, clearly, this is not Vlogbrothers. in fact, i was more than a little discouraged by the ...shitlord undertones. but before writing it off, in part because i was so desperate for a transwoman to look up to and also because i got here on recommendation (of sorts) from Lindsay Ellis who i greatly respect, i decided to follow up that first video with "How I Became a Feminist SJW" and while there were still bits that i could tell you had yet to... shake off, i realized that... this was how my journey went. (though i did kind of skip over the genderqueer transition bit. i mean, i did identify as "peacock" for a couple of years but that was basically presented more like mildly flamboyant metrosexual in long women's overcoats. basically, a friend just asked me if i was transgender and after reactively saying "no" [and then completely obliviously adding on "i'm more like a lesbian in a man's body" ...<.<...], the question rattled in my head for a week and after spending the weekend thinking about it i became 100% convinced that i was trans. and then she took me shopping) almost note for note. i mean, i was (and still kinda am) fairly sexually repressed and vanilla so a lot of *that* stuff and its periphery doesn't apply, but... ideologically... emotionally... i'd also gone from "intellectually superior" shitlord to trans feminist SJW. i never in a thousand years would have expected such thorough... validation (i hesitate to use the word because i feel it's overused, but if this isn't where it applies, frankly where does it?). or that that validation could feel so welcoming.  *tl;dr* to paraphrase Mick Jagger, you can't always get what you want, but turns out this channel - and in particular this video - is exactly what i needed.  (P.S. what i was wanting, in this case, was basically something warm-fuzzy and comforting without feeling patronizing that kind of just lets me ignore my problems for a bit. what i got was something that is rarely truly comfortable, but is much more... i dunno what to call it. but it's good. not just in the sense of nice, or well-made but... good.)
Just discovered your channel a few weeks ago, and have been consuming vids like a white, powdery, illicit substance.  Thanks for taking the time and risk making this, really powerful stuff to think about.
(cis queer woman just for the record, also not a native speaker so if I fuck up word use politeness stuff I'm sorry) Thank you for making this video. I learned a lot, but it also made me sad because of, well, the mere fact that it's necessary. Womanhood is a tricky thing to begin with, and I can't even begin to imagine how daunting the whole experience as a trans woman is. And the idea that there are people who can't even begin to fathom that, who constantly try to undermine you, invalidate you, and pathologise you (as an autistic person that angle is kinda familiar if in a different way), fills me with rage.  That said. I'm new to the channel (my brother pointed me your way, gotta remember to thank him) and I'm kinda poking through your vids. The incel one was the first one I watched, and my first thought, like, two seconds in, was damn, she's gorgeous. And she's got a lovely, soothing voice. And then I discovered that you're clever and witty and educated without being snobbish (and damn, your salt about academia in that other vid rang so fucking true, I found myself just nodding along). Your sense of humour is absolutely great, I haven't had this many gigglesnorts in a while so thank you for that too. You make youtube a better place.  I hope I didn't say anything weird or awkward, this whole social interaction thing is something I'm just really bad at. Take the bits you like and feel free to -SMASH- forget the rest. Rock on ^^
You’re awesome.
I'm a ciswoman, and I sleep in a bra! I have to in order to be comfortable.  I know that probably seems a bit random, but I wanted to give you a little validation in your experience of womanhood.   I really like how your videos can respectfully deconstruction a controversial viewpoint without an opening for a reasonable individual to dismiss you at least on a basis of knowledge. That takes guts and logic, and I look up to you for it.
Once again a great video! (Sorry I am new here) Thank you for sharing your perspective. I think it helps a lot of people greatly understand a lot of aspects they are greatly misinformed about.
One thing I learned here is bailey's kinks, that’s a) waaay too much information and b) typical, a good simplification of my 7 years at Uni studying literature. There’s more, but that’s the one that traumatized me.
37:15 "It's actually a sexual orientation." Thanks, I choked on my water.
I just wanted to say that I know a couple trans women who are not transitioning for any sexual reasons. A few are basically asexual, and have little to no sexual drive (before and after HRT).
I’m cis and I sleep in a bra. My friends think it’s weird but I need to contain the tit.
17:57 XD I'm fixated on the fact that your shirt matches the curtains. It looks like you're becoming one with the curtains.
All in all quite thin. I found more sanity on r/gendercritical.
Great vid conta, I actually first found you through your incel video and honestly only found out you were trans now.....so revealing this much personal info must have been difficult but yea this was the motivated reasoning of a freudian professor who barely required a response as a single psych study on sexual response would disprove it :P
5:34 "information clusters" such an important thing to bring up. This is essentially what masculinity and femininity are. If you were to make a bell curve type graph with one end being extremely masculine and the other being extremely feminine and plot humanity on this graph the outer ends would be low points, and the middle would be a low point. This leaves us with two bumps/bell curves. The one on the masculine side is men, the one on the feminine side is women. Most people classify what it is to be men or women based on the peaks, which has some statistical validity to it...  I'm getting too into trying to describe this... this guy has a graph and better explains it and I think it's so important to look at and understand why looking at "standard" masculinity and femininity is bad, not just for trans/NB people, but anyone who falls outside of that standard.
You’re a star ❤️
Holistic as friggles; my chromosomes thank u with all their lil ribbons
you sing, also?! :heart explodes:
I wont say I know one way or the other what causes gender dysphoria, no one does yet. And I know how controversial this topic is but you cant really refute a theory without providing evidence. And I mean real re testable, quantitative evidence not your own personal experiences. Alot of your argument relies on thought experiment, circular arguments and personal biases. And although it is an entertaining video I cant say im impressed by all this.   You go a long way to protest too much against something you know may or may not be true without saying why. At the end of the day you are not a scientist, and its disingenuous to present a video on a topic you are really not that knowledgeable on. Sorry for being so negative but all videos like this do is muddy the waters and waste valuable effort and oxygen on something that could be more concrete, and if one day you are proven wrong, right wing bigots will point to this video and say how all along it has been a case of feels over facts in the lgbt community.
I am the hypersexual pervert vainly in love with himself as a woman. Just figuring out my next move
THANK YOU so much for sharing your candor & vulnerability!! I especially appreciate how you shared about your childhood experience. My step-child has recently told his father & I that he's "considering" being transgender (but still identifies as male).  I've come to realize that I had bought into the "feminine essentialism" theorey, but as a radical, I was able to avoid invalidating him (I hope) & instead asked him some questions about his experience.  So it really helps to hear about your experiences as a kid & there is some overlap with my step-child. Thank you so much!
My typical stupid tangents aside this was super interesting and enlightening for me, thanks for sharing!
Is there a word for being primarily attracted to men with feminine features and trans women but not really cis women?  Not that I'm meaning to degrade people to little more than a fetish, at least not intentionally I don't ever mean to do that at all at least not any more I mean I'm not profiling anyone at least not meaning to I mean c'mo-....  I'll just quit while I'm ahead.
you and chris flemmings need to make a version of dantes inferno
also i really really appreciate this video. you're really inspirational to me.
My mom sent me this bull shit the other day.  https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-why-the-surge-in-gender-dysphoria-among-teenage-girls/   Ray Blanchard apparently agrees with the study's conclusions, so yay, trans men don't get to sit this one out!
autogynephile harry plinkett is my fetish, thanks contrapoints.
i too, was a physically inept androgyne who learned music as a youth. love your piano <3
When you have a theory that cannot be falsified, it's not the scientific ideal. It's not science. Wait, are you trolling there?
I'm here because I need a reaction gif of Natalie saying *problematic* dramatically at 41:32
Hold up, first off, if anyone deserves to go to heaven, it's dogs. Dogs are good boys. Human beings are capricious liars fueled by spite and pettiness. I mean, I don't believe in heaven, but if there was a heaven and only the best souls got to go, of course it'd be filled with dogs. A perfect afterlife would be incomplete without dogs anyway so it's pretty much necessity. Of course, my heaven would also be filled with danger noodles, and most Christians aren't huge fans of snakes.
I know I'm late to the party, but from a heterosexual cisgender man, thank you for this. I learned a lot.
actually im a cis woman and i do sleep with a bra i dont know why i just like my boobs
The sexual part of the video was really interested. I never really thought about it before I guess.
this is so goddamn good, I am a generally open cishet guy who is kind of interested in learning about critical theory, and different experiences.  I try and read different authors, talk to people, etc. generally be interested in my fellow person. But I do not know how I would ever have learned the contents of this video except for the existence of this video.  You're doing a great service
"but what do cis women wanna have sex as? walruses?" honestly, mood
It would explain why so many trans women prostitute themselves
yo maybe i'm just a demon but i used to sleep with a bra on alllllll the time
When I first heard of the word Autogynephilia I just thought it was like any other fetish. Like it was just a fantasy someone could harmlessly fulfill rather than an actual "justification" for someone being born a man wanting to become a woman. Didn't realise it was used in such a transphobic way. DAMN!
This felt really affirming. Thank you!
i love how you approach topics like this, like it's a very sensitive topic that would make most trans people really uncomfortable to talk about but the way you explain in-depth what the term 'autogynephilia' means and where it comes from before responding to it is really refreshing. i think most leftists avoid that cause thinking about how cis people think we're all gross monsters just fucking sucks
"What do they think cis women want to have sex as, walruses!?" Well, I know some of the artists of FurAffinity might have some interest in that...usually as cis female walruses though.
I've wound up very disenfranchised as someone who considered myself very obviously a lefty and has watched how "SJWs" and "Alt-Right" have formed over the last 8 years or so as tribes on Youtube (and the internet). I never found myself pushed towards the "right", however I did find it more interesting to watch take-downs of people preaching Social Justice values than of right-wing ones. I think that's for two reasons. 1) I had already spent my formative years consciously and sub-consciously working through my own moral compass and was content that I was a "good person" and that my ideals are "left-wing". 2) I think that there are a LOT of lightning rods in the form of inarticulate University students on sociology courses, narcissists who identify with certain aspects of Social Justice (superiority) and actual children who are genuinely empathetic and good-hearted but do not do well with nuance because they are actual children!  This put me in a weird place which I think people like Sargon articulated well (and genuinely I believe) where he felt more concerned with those on his side making the left look bad, which in turn may further entrench the idea that "left wing ideals are for kids, who then grow up and become conservative". Which sucks, because there are obviously a lot of important points at the heart of pretty much any Social Justice talking point, e.g. Systemic Racism, Toxic Masculinity, Gender Pay Gap, but all of which you'll typically seen discussed either using extreme statistics recklessly that undermine the broader point by making it look childish and naive, or being discussed in a very shame-inducing way that is very off-putting to ME (someone who broadly agrees with it), let alone someone who finds it actually challenging to their beliefs. To expand on this slightly further, I think my fundamental belief that most people are good and compassionate, tied with my belief that people who lean towards the right socially are less well-developed in terms of empathy genuinely leads me to the conclusion that the way we talk about progress is incredibly important. Anyone who can't convey progressive view points without making the person they're talking to feel like shit should consider themselves to have failed, hell, they should feel empowered to do the right thing and be as compassionate as possible. As you grow up you should learn that regardless of political views most people are not actually shitty humans, and it's a skill to recognise who is too damaged to be worth the time investment.  It's a very unsatisfying place to be in, my conclusion has broadly been that I don't like anyone, and I don't even enjoy the discourse because it's so unpleasant. Then I watched your stuff and I felt a real sense of relief. I get stressed out when someone presumes my point and puts me in a box (has happened in both directions), so I can only imagine what it's like when people think your gender identity is intrinsically a political statement. Yet you are able to articulate yourself incredibly well, be genuinely funny and very human.  I'm sure at this stage you are well aware on a logical level, and hopefully and emotional level, but you really are quite exceptional and I hope you feel my praise. Even though I'm not really important, I hope I might give you some confidence that you're not just preaching to the converted, but that you are actually doing something meaningful in the broader sense.
ContraPoints is amazing and this video is amazing! I haven't actually been enthralled and entertained by a YouTube video in the same way in a long time.
I think psychology, sociology and sexual science (?) are hardly representative of all sciences. Luckely those are not. Luckely, Bailey's (and Blanchard's) nonsense even less so.
"when I was having regular heterosexual sex, I felt like my soul was leaving my body and I had to get the poison out" this this this. I've described it in this exact way before (I'm transmasc so it's on the other end), it's such a terrifying and numbing feeling. im so glad you are in a better place now.
so gay men who like gay men (me) dont exist? ok.........
I have suddenly realized that the difficulty i have had being in the same room as a trans woman was out of fear and just not really having any understanding whatsoever. After watching and re-watching a few of your videos the fear and distrust has lifted somewhat sadly it has taken me until I am 64 years old to understand trans women are not the freaks i believed.
Sigh, oh to be on the recieving end of an angry transgender mob   (Jk, no transphobe)
A theory which can't be falsified is not a scientific ideal, it is inherently and automatically invalid. It doesn't count. But non-scientific people don't know that, which is why they believe a charlatan like Blanchard
Holy fuck though, the fucksaw incident?!?!
Ohh I love the ending
'More women are into feminizing boys than you might think'. I think the evidence for this claim is pretty obvious. Primary school education is dominated by women, many of whom resent the presence of any men in and around boys.
Watch out dudes, that twerking butt means you obviously have something strongly wrong with yourself... I mean... it does, it means you have too much money and not enough to spend it on... but that's not what I meant.
You comparing male sexuality to a demonic possession was hilarious and so relatable to me. I'm honestly surprised there isn't a movement of guys just castrating themselves and not transitioning to avoid the madness.
Another CSWM here. I'm a science teacher and the one principle I try to teach my students, above all else, is never stop seeking knowledge. I try to follow the same rule (after all, hypocrisy is the fastest way to lose one's legitimacy) and as such I have sought many "Social Justice" channels in an attempt to understand the various perspectives found in the realm intersectionality. Some channels are extremely antagonistic, assuming the audience is either here to reinforce their already-held beliefs, or they are here to antagonize and insult the channel/creator/viewers. Sadly, this is all too often the case, so I don't blame them for the antagonism.  Suffice it to say, your channel is a breath of fresh air among so many stagnant pools of anger and loathing. You are clearly intelligent, but you don't wield that as a club against the uninformed/misinformed. I admire that. You also are willing to yield points that some creators refuse to acknowledge because they seemingly believe that either the "left" is totally correct, or it is totally wrong, and yielding any ground would be tantamount to total surrender of their philosophy. Ironically, this attitude is the very thing that causes people to become immovable in their arguments and perspectives. The willingness to "give-and-take" in a discussion is a mark of genuine intellectual honesty. Another rare and admirable trait.   Suffice it to say I have really enjoyed your videos, both in presentation and content. Thank you for offering a hand in cooperation to those who simply want to better understand others, not fight or troll. It is the only way we'll ever attain the goal of an accepting, compassionate, egalitarian society where all are welcome, because all are human and deserve a safe, peaceful existence.
I, a cis woman, sleep in a bra sometimes. But I also sleep in jeans like a weirdo. So take that as you will.
....so i looked it up ;_;
shoutout to easily available medication from the republic of vanuatu
I felt personally attacked at 43:05
There's actually a lot of cis women who sleep in bras. Sometimes it's because our boobs are sore and we want to keep them stabilized. Some do it because they think it'll help with sagging. I do sometimes in the summer because I don't have a/c and need to something about the boob sweat.
ContraPoints I discovered your channel only recently and I'm devouring your vids one after another. This one just really hit me in the guts. I'm a white cis hetero guy with a comfortable life, education and situation (aka the life lottery winner), so I have basically not experienced much in the way of misery/dysphoria (apart from being a Nice Guy™ and kind of an incel for quite a long time, although I'm cured now :p), and litterally nothing in the systemic oppression department (unless being mocked for wearing glasses counts, which I doubt heavily).  I must say, if this vid isn't an eye-opener when it comes to what transgender people live, I don't know what is. I can't even fathom the level of anguish and psychologic pain you have endured and have to put up with even now that you know who you are, and I cannot state how admirative I am of your courage, showing and telling all this to an anonymous crowd that may or may not be able to understand how beautiful a person you are, and react in a wrong and potentially hateful way. Not all heroes wear capes as the saying goes, and I think you are definitely one in your own way.  Stay strong, and please never ever doubt how much of a badass chick you are.  PS: Let's do the time warp again!
32:35 omg at this moment I realised how smart this video is like WOAAAAAH
So I just found your channel and as I’ve scoured your videos over my weekend, I must say, you can nail a fuckin intro like nobody else. *Snaps* or something
*trans applause*
I've always loved from an early age listening and discussing how one's life a jumbled fuck ride of inputs and outputs. Watching your videos for the past week has been fantastic for multiple of reasons but this video was so introspective without horrible self-defecation that I can't stop thinking about it. The last 3 minutes made me cry on the raw honestly. I love you and hope you find a fulfilling partner (not that you need one to fulfill your life but you know what I mean).   Also, KEEP MAKING MORE CONTENT YOU SEXY BEAST!
<3
your editing style reminds me of Stanley Kubrick, so genius.
IDK if anyone relate to that but i'm a cis bisexual woman. I'm more atracted by female body than male body. Female body turns me on and not male body. But in sex i'm more turn on by touching a male body than touching a female body. Menaning a girl needs to touch my sex to turn me on when a man just need to let me touch his torso...Is that weird?
you're my role model
<3
I have to say, as a transwoman who is struggling to even internally properly articulate what I feel and how it makes me trans, your testimonial from 18:17 to 23:07 is really helpful and I want to thank you for it. A lot of what you said really resonates with me, and while some of it I cannot (wish I had been really androgynous too) a lot of how you felt is similar to how I feel. I have very lightly dabbled in cross-dressing, and there has been a bit of a sexual aspect to it, but when I think harder about it I always come around to the idea that its not the cross-dressing and feminizing itself that appeals to me, but how it changes people's perspectives and actions towards me and seeing me as feminine. I always thought that if I had been born a woman while most other things stayed the same I would probably been called a bit of a tomboy, and I would've been happy with that. Thinking about it now I think that fear I have is also related to the need for trans women to be ultra feminine to be valid. All in all I want to thank you for putting this out there, it has shown me that my perspective is not necessarily a unique one.
So, I COULD use this comment on the powerful and articulate insights in this video... or I could just swoon over how overwhelmingly attractive and endearing I find her as she hits that last note on the piano in the end. <3
Genuinely so beautiful, you are a stunning woman contra and I don't think you should ever feel like you are anything less xx
What is that bouncy awkward tune used to introduce each part?
so what's the song that's played on the 13:00
You're such a badass to be able to do this. Not only are you exposing your inter turmoils but you help show the truth behind the biases and misunderstandings cis people never consider when it comes to trans women. I also, like that you pointed out the overall views on women's sexuality from the predominantly male scientific community that presides over both the cis and trans women. I'm a cis woman so was really happy to get a better insight from you! You're amazing!
I dig your channel and appreciate you making videos. You “show your work”, so to speak, and don’t just flat out assert things. Even when I don’t agree with you, I can see how you got to your conclusions, and that’s what I want to see more of. You’re also an attractive woman, with a funny streak, and a wonderful style. Keep it up, great moves, proud of you.
Your colors and music are very Pajama Sam for some reason
Fuck maybe I'm actually trans. I can relate to that feeling of wtf is my male masturbatory nature. For a while I've felt just weirded the agressiveness of my male friends also although that could be due to other issues. I've always kinda felt othered by how cocky and all knowing other men act.
Props lady! Love your work! (That Plinkett reference <3 ) And I wear corsets and fishnets... I like goth. xD
You may not be a cis woman but you hit the nail on the head with sexual desire as a female. Its like 40% physical attraction 60% personality.
the bisexual lightning (tm) ist just the icing of the amazing cake <3
"Get a statue of Hermaphroditus on there or something." I burst out laughing. Well done. XD
39:27 you know i had to do it to em
buffalo bill isn't trans, it says so explicitly in the movie.
I’m a cis woman and I sleep with a bra on
I love u and you make me so comfortable when it comes to being a trans man.  Like hoo boy im not consistently kicking myself about being a boy
Natalie knows more about my sexuality than I do. I thank her for sharing the knowledge.
"Autogynephile Harry Plinkett " omfg
Thank you for doing this. You are a heroine exposing your own story in such a public manner. And thank you for the clear explanation of Blanchards many mistakes in his theory.
This is the best channel on YouTube
I relate to the elder gods ripping my gender identity in twain idea. In a personally attacked kind of way. My my inclination is still toward increasing complexity in rationalizing elder gods into something related to the brain's capacity to accommodate multiple sentiences, but it's pretty much #relatable. I'm glad someone put it to words outside of my own head.
Stop giving me weird boners they're hard to hide in this skirt.
The end of this video makes me wanna give you a hug.
Well I think that you are wonderfully beautiful.  I just love everything about you!❤
why does your voice soothe me so? I always go back to your vids to calm me down in anxiety or pick me up from depressive episodes
Thank you, Thank you, Thank you a Thousand time Thank you, for putting all of this out there
I've had a lot of anxiety today and I've been watching a lot of your videos. I find your voice really relaxing and just love listening to you speak. All the love 💕❤️
Geez, at the very least I've learned what the Republic of Vanuatu is.
Reading about the "fucksaw incident" was an interesting experience.
You have such an elegant and sophisticated flair about you that even saying "I just want to be fucked every once in a while" sounds like a queen's note about the state of the nation. :D
Whelp, just discovered this channel and I know who I'm binge-watching for the next 8 hours
I'm actually not convinced by your characterisation of the romance genre, or of pornography written by women, as something where you identify with the female protagonist - but that's a complicated question. Overall I found this fascinating & insightful (& very funny) and I definitely recognised a version of my (cis) female bisexuality in your description.
I now realize I was transphobic in my opinions. I was ignorant and shallow focusing on my own experience and my own oppression as an absolute determinant of what it is to be female.  I'm proud to call you a sister :* Much love from the eastern block
Although I am more of the Libertarian-conservative camp, I truly enjoy your videos, keep up the good work.
This was so informative and helpful. Thank you for sharing your experiences and thoughts with us!
This video is great!  I'm someone who has been struggling with some dysphoric feelings the last few years, and I have no idea what to do.  After watching this and trying to digest all the information, my head is spinning.  I wish I had someone I could talk to about this.  I love your channel, thank you so much!
"Sometimes you have to explain what it means to be trans to a person who believes that dogs go to heaven."   And, with that, you have become my favorite educator/philosopher/public commentator of ever.  I just love you so much right now, there aren't even words.
"It's sexy to wanted by someone who is qualified" "You want to be wanted by someone with fine taste who selects you""it's not a story about wanting a man, it's a story about being wanted BY a man". When you said this, something just clicked in my head. Like that's it, that's how I am turned on. You have better explained how my sexuality works better than any of the sexual health nurses and clinicians ever could.
I want to hear the science, otherwise its just a rant and you are no better than angry White nationalists.
This video was really good! I sincerely appreciate you talking about your history of transition. It put a lot of things from my own past into perspective. Thank you
Bitchin video I love u and I’m a Big Slut for how you do lighting
8:20 Well, I definitely have not seen enough hentai to know where that was going...  I hope this registers at worst as a bad joke about my username.
Wow - that seemed very honest and answered some questions that I might
hey we have the same doses
Don’t dream it, be it!  Ok, first um....I’m a bi woman...I find you incredibly attractive (before and after the transition) and would be all over that if I weren’t already married to a man who just won’t share....I’ll work on him so maybe one day...I mean intelligence is extremely sexy and you have that in spades.  That being said, I have to say I hate to look at myself. I hate my body. I can’t stand the idea of anyone looking at me and the idea of someone finding me attractive actually makes me extremely uncomfortable. I guess I am as far from a narcissist as possible. Actually since I had cancer and had to have a hysterectomy I’m pretty much asexual. If being a woman requires bleeding every month, I’m not a woman anymore. I feel a bit in limbo at the moment. I guess writing all this makes me pretty much a horrible loser but this is my only real outlet, so there you go. I’m a sad introvert who was never adopted by an extrovert so I just folded in on myself.  I just felt the need to tell you how wonderful you are. I bet you know that already and better people than me have told you, but I needed to say it all the same. You are incredibly talented, intelligent, thoughtful, witty, beautiful, amazing...I lack the vocabulary to state it adequately and for that I apologize. The idea that someone like you for even one moment would feel less than is insane to a screw up like me.
Wow, bravest shit on YouTube hands down.
i dont love the sissy types who hit on me... errr ask me to debase them  But I do like that people are pretty and that is more them FEELING PRETTY   I dont like the humilation aspect.
i love that it looks like you raided my room  I have wigs on heads and other things   I really need to learn how to you know make videos  I am gonna do some DIY stuff or so I thought...   umm I think i have some ideas for other things  COMMENT for COMMENT SAKE    The longer the better and oh yes emoji  <3 :P   but for real I like you  I happen to be bi so its a How You Doing - Objectification  That said I tell you so you know people enjoy attractive people and also well spoken smart ones   THE idea that girls need to be DUMB  makes man Trans struggle  Because the way people start looking at them as less smart   UGH
you would not believe how hard I panicked when you said your sexuality changed when you transitioned. being an afab pre-hormones transmasc person, I'm terrified of what could happen to my pansexual identity once I go on testosterone. but it was also nice to know why by attraction to women is so different to my attraction to men, so that's cool too. maybe I'll enjoy being physically attracted to women more, who knows
YOU ARE BOSS AT PIANO. Have you ever considered performing outside of youtube? Play at fancy restaurants? Be part of a travelling musical? I love your musical talents. Please perform more for us.
If it means anything to you at all, I (a cisgender woman) also sleep in a bra.
I'm afab nonbinary and this is giving me huge realizations? Thank you?
I want autogynephile Harry Plinket a lot.
It makes me fucking sick that there are people who are not subscribed to you.
So hang on this guy got guest speakers to have sex on stage with a homemade fuck machine...and expects his opinion on sexuality to be taken seriously?
7:45 was that the guy from game ranks?
"I sleep in a bra which I'm pretty sure no cis woman has ever done"  as a cis woman this bothered me- maybe I'm a lazy oddity but I never take off my bra just to sleep, so don't beat yourself up over something so silly.
Summary in response to minute one: Most studies have shown that women are turned on by the idea of themselves being turned on.  So..... I mean does that need an addendum?
This is off topic, but had anyone ever told you that you look JUST like Keira Knightly, Natalie? Especially in the moments where you're singing opera in the mirror. I swear you could be her doppelganger.  Anyway, great video and very informative as always.
Cher sounds fun
*I FIND OUT LATER SHE IS FROM  B E L I Z E*
;( I've been out for about 2 months and came across this video and it's made me realise more and more how definitely trans I am. I don't know if I could say thanks as if this video is useful to me, but it's more eye-opening to how other people may not understand gender dysphoria.
The production value & insight into these videos is over the top, I approve, & thank you.  The frustrating part about having to explain the issues of a marginalized group to the majority is that you have to do shit like this, literally bare your soul to people that might pick it apart, just for the chance of convincing them of a viewpoint other than their own.  I don't think there's enough way to thank you while also thanking trans people in general. Thanks for putting up with cis people, for all of us agender, genderqueer, & cis people living that smoothly sliding under the radar life.
I especially loved the final thougths. As a cis male, I can identify with that way of one sided thinking, at least I used to. And while I have 'overcome' that perspective, and am now able to emphasize with the trans perspective in a way that makes me 'understand' (ofc I will never fully understand it) the trans-experience, I think it is very needed in our society today, even for the people who claim they 'fully support 'trans-people'. Even so, I want to show my utmost respect towards you Nathalie, it takes a tremendous amount of courage to make a video like this and open up the way you did! Even though we shouldn't use this as a 'look how you can also be' way of thinking towards trans-people, it is nonetheless very educational and will definitely contribute to the increase off acceptance as well as understanding of trans in our communities and society as a whole! For that I thank you! Also, you look pretty amazing tbh, and it seems to be getting 'better' (plz dont shoot me) everytime you upload a video. Give yourself some credit Nathalie, you deserve it :)
Thank you
lol is that Falcon? Omg, as soon as I heard that narration, I had to keep from laughing xD
Stumbled upon your channel and ... God, girl, can we be friends? I love your wit and your aesthetics 💜
Im a cis demisexual- no desire to be a man but i fucking love corsets and usually the fantasies i fap to are usually envisioned from a male perspective. Its just better viewpoints. All i can see in real life is tiddies and stomach. Dudes get all the good views. Fapping in another mindset doesnt really matter.
I discovered your videos yesterday, and I feel like it is love at first sight! 😍 You are so smart and funny, your videos are so well structured and informed, and you are so stunning! I’m glad you exist!
After watching your incels video, youtube autoplay led me here and right after you said "and affirms the common prejudice that trans people are really just sex perverts, which, OKAY, SOME OF US ARE BUT NOT FOR THE REASON BLANCHARD SAYS" my sides lifted into orbit and i clicked subscribe. Very good content.
Thank you. You are absolutely wonderful.
the reddit app won't let me unsubscribe from TwoXChromosomes and I don't know why it won't let me.
i love your channel so much jesus christ the reading part is iconic
This was great as one transwomen to another this took some  alls
BITCH WHAT TH E HECK. I'm shook. I'm from Belize!! I get called exotic a lot [[on tinder, go figure]] and it actually makes me  sick)
Funny enough, as you talked later, I knew about autogynephilia when I started crossdressing, now I'm cishet guy and I'm sure of that, I'm not trans, and as I started discovering my androginous side autogynephilia was super popular as a way non-trans non-gender conforming men use to describe themselves.  Kind of like "I'm not trans that must mean I'm a pervert right" a lot of people think like that because its hard to explain why would you want to dress like a women withouth wanting to be a woman.  It took a while to realize that the idea that clothes, make up and hair products had nothing with "gender" at all. It turns out the idea of putting gender on artificial made products was stupid.
my best friend came out to me as trans and although I'm a whatever blows your skirt kind of person, I didn't fully understand my friend. You have enlightened me this day...
Damn girl! That was amazing! Thanks!
Am late to this. I remember when Blanchard's book came out (I went to college in Ripon, WI)  and it bears the same bs import as The Bell Curve. Thank you for baring yourself, the bad research and piss poor POV of this so called academic.
Holy shit the part from 18:30 is nearly IDENTICAL to my experience. Same age, same thought processes etc.  Edit: EVERY. SINGLE. POINT. Even the thing with ordering hormones shortly after making the connection what's up with me, since the "anxiety/dysphoria" was so intense.
10:48 quote of the century
I googled the fucksaw incident as you told me. I don't know what to feel--but one feeling I think is creeping through my confusion is, "y tho"  ETA: Sexuality with masturbatory practices was pushed incredibly hard in the 90s with Silence of the Lambs. It messed it all up
Okay, who mentions an "Angular face" as highly attractive. An "Angular face."  Really.
Honestly, I’m totally in love with Natalie’s content (to the extent that I became a patron after only watching a video and a half, go support her, it costs as little as $1) but this feature-film-length video (that I didn’t realize how long it was until I had already watched the whole thing) takes the cake. Thank you Natalie, you gorgeous woman, for speaking truth to power, putting yourself way more out there than you ever needed to, and being the champagne socialist we all need at this time in our culture 🙌🏼💋
Anyone that starts with a conclusion and then works backwards to find data that supports their conclusion, ignoring what doesn't fit, isn't engaging in science.
I know this video is six months old but thanks for an interesting, eye-opening discussion. It must be exhausting to have to re-litigate your internal experience over and over again with people describing you to you. I am aware of the irony of just having literally done that.
You are so beautiful inside & out, Natalie. With smile so pure and radiant, it makes me smile each time :) Thank you for your insightful and informative vulnerability sprinkled with glamorous humour.  Thank you for challenging and questioning, always showing new perspectives and nuances. Finally, thank you for letting us participate in your journey, it's honestly amazing to see you b(l)o(s)som as woman. And dayum, I'm a straight girl but I would totally (very awkwardly) fuck you.
I FIND OUT LATER SHE IS FROM BELIZE
I want to see your set and colored lights
I wish I could help you financially thru Patreon, but since I can't, here's a sub, views and shares! Your videos are very educational and entertaining! Thank you for putting yourself out there for the benefit of humanity even though you get hate.  All my love and gratitude, a recent subscriber.
Wow! I just found your channel a week ago and have been watching your videos on and off since then. I don't have many friends or acquaintances in the LGBTQ community, so as a cis man your videos are quite eye opening. Your willingness to share so much of your personal life, plus the way you can explain and educate (all the while being extremely funny and charismatic) these complex issues is amazing!
I sleep in a bra!
As a cis woman who wears bras when she sleeps I feel e x t r e m e l y  attacked
I really just don't get his theory, of seems obvious to me that dividing trans women into these two restrictive groups makes no sense, like, where's the basis in fact? I just don't understand how some guy can just postulate two groups of people out of his ass and say that no people exist outside of them, and that everyone fits them, because, it's just so obviously wrong.
The lighting in this video's giving me Blade Runner vibes.
As a cis old fuck, thank you. And I will think harder about it.
I love this so much.
This is the longest youtube video I’ve ever watched and I loved every second
Isn't someone who believes in this trying to get a position in WPATH?
I don't usually do YouTube comments but I just want to say that this video was inspiring and emotional honest in a way that really moved me. I only became aware of you yesterday but I've been devouring your content. I love your politics, your approach and you. Straight cis male here, hoping I'm not coming over as condescending or something, but the world needs more voices like yours x
I sleep in a bra, so if you're worried, it's not that abnormal <3 x
I'm showing this to my fiance. The description of female sexuality is super affirming and clearly worded. Thank you for sharing your experience!! This whole video is insanely well done.
some ciswomen with big breasts sleep with their bras on, i dunno why because i;m not one of them
I am happy living as a man in my male body, but there are aspects of male sexual behaviour which can feel very alienating.The daily obligation to come, the visual arousal cues, the paraphilias... these can feel like burdens. Sometimes they make me behave in ways which I am not happy with, and which I feel I have less control over.   Thank you for such vulnerable, honest self-expression. You're an inspiration.
Just discovered you channel recently and just fell in love! Really enjoy your videos and the points that you're making<3
You much such quality content. I'm really happy I found your channel!
Don't know if this would help, but I'm a cis woman and totally wear my bra to bed.
Dogs don't go to heaven?....damn...that's a bum out...
I think the bit of you, like, "interviewing" yourself was super, super helpful. Thank you for including that.
17:19 - Ace people exist.  Good video!
I've had slight dysphoria for the last week more then usual, i just push it off of as me being stupid like my family has said, but this video has hit be with a baseball bat worth of dysphoria that i feel like I'm going to cry
you are fucking awesome.
I would like to add that I enjoy your videos a lot. They are almost motivational for me in a way, as I think about social issues with the same methodology and carefulness, while being critical and open-minded. Being that I am trans myself, it is especially important to hear from you. You give me hope that I will one day be able to feel at peace in my own skin, and that the bond between mind and body will be mended.
You are gorgeous and sexy and I have a huge crush on you, just saying.
Idk yall as a cishet dude i got hit on and lucked out with women (including women who knew me for years) way more when i was swole despite being actively suicidal than i did when i was chubby and confident. That really fucked me up and made me bitter for a while but I’m over it maybe probably idk.  Sexual selection still probably applies to human animals as much as other animals so i just deal with it realistically   Women might care less about physicality than dudes on the whole but in my experience it’s not less enough to make a huge difference, and i think part of the issue with disaffected young dudes is them having to cope with a casual dating scene where a surly buff dude gets attention he clearly doesn’t want when they want attention they aren’t capable of getting. I’ve been on both sides of that coin now.   I got away with a hell of a lot when i was in shape—like having extreme and severe mental illness, and acting like it—that i never really did when i was out of shape.   Like, if you’re in agreement with the standard of beauty, people will project onto you the values they want you to have and only hold it against themselves when you fail them, cutting you all kinds of slack. That’s obviously more true for people with low self esteem or desperation than their opposites, but sometimes this shit just eats me up and i have to say something
I have actually heard Blanchard’s Typology used by a relative who was trying to understand why I would be a transmale and attracted to men, when apparently “all transmales transition because they are actually lesbian females who want to be seen in a more socially acceptable light.”
I have to say this is a topic ive never really been interested in. I dont really care what other people do. But you speak so intelligently you have made this very interesting. Honestly i would just enjoy hearing you speak about any topic. I enjoy intelligent conversation and listening to you give the impression of being in one. As a side note, when i first watched one of your videos, on incels, i didnt realize that you weren't a woman. Maybe it was because i was so engrossed by what you were saying , or maybe i just truly didnt realize. Im not sure why i needed to say that. But anyway, I am enjoying your vids and will continue to watch.
I know quite a lot of cis women who sleep in bras btw
Is it true that some people's orientation changes after transitioning?  Is this a myth?
"you just found a person who built a sex robot" will probably forever be my favorite line in your videos. ;dd
As a cis probably bisexual male I have to say that my lust is more about connections than object oriented stuff. Methinks.
Great and interesting vid, with one minor hangup.  I feel that self-objectification, or rather lack of objectification of your sexual partner, isn't inherent and hormone-induced in women but rather societal. I understand that what you're putting forward is that you feel how a lot of cis women do, and that is wanting to be wanted, rather than wanting the other's (especially a man's) body, but the way you tell it, it's like you have to be a gay man to be turned on by a man's body. This sort of reasoning is a bit sexist/essentialist to me, and certainly doesn't align with my experience as a cis woman who's into men, body parts included. Totally cis-het couples can have a woman who'll be turned on exclusively at the sight of the man's body, and conversely a man who will be turned on by the fact that the woman is lusting after his body. I think a healthy couple and more generally a healthy society should have all players able to take on both roles. And similarly I don't think that if a trans woman is getting wet/hard at the mere sight of a male body that means that her sexuality remains inherently male. It's just "masculine", because right now as a society we've decided only men get to be visual. But that's not my experience.  Anyways thanks for the insight.
I don’t know why the sleeping in a bra part brought me to tears. Sorry for being a creep. And 💕
Bacchhhhhhh
So according to Blanchard, male arousal is only (or predominantly) based on physical lust? Speaking as a cis gay male, that is such horseshit. Physical lust and emotional/mental arousal aren't somehow linked exclusively to what you have between your legs or what gender you identify as, everyone experiences multiple kinds of arousal to different degrees. For me, physical appearance has almost no bearing on how aroused I am, I only get aroused by the behaviour of and emotional connection to my sexual partner. Trying to classify types of arousal as belonging to particular genders is ludicrous.
no such thing as souls
Sounds more like they're the ones in love with themselves. And i'd like to add, these guys who aren't trans, are saying people would transition just to satisfy a masturbatory aid, are most likely saying that from the stand point that they would do anything to get off. by their own theory they seem like the type to push bounderies just to get off, no matter who it jepordizes. The fucksaw incident is a prime example. That had no reason to go down, imo. you can teach a class about femeale orgasm without having to demonstrate it with a sex robot. let's be honest, thats what it was.
Thank you for describing my exact trajectory in terms of dysphoria and history and transition -- this is so affirming. Blanchard really didn't get many data points. ..
This is so bizarre an experience for me. I'm strange, for a long time I've identified as more than one person, in a way that's mostly annoying more than anything else. I both believe that one cannot truly have multiple personalities, and it's all self deception, while also believing that I have multiple personalities and am deceiving myself in some way I can't stop or understand.  I generally just call myself gender fluid and move on with my life, I've become comfortable with that label and thankfully don't feel nearly as much gender dysphoria as I did growing up. That's also in large part due to society and many of my ex girlfriends telling me how great I am being masculine and encouraging me to act and think that way.   The really weird part is, at one point when I was extremely emotionally fragmented and my identity was shattered into several people, I had a strange "relationship" with an alternate identity. This included odd behaviors such as pulling my long hair into a pony-tail, and just longingly staring into my own eyes in a mirror. Followed by a hate that this obviously could never be anything outside of my head. In many ways, I don't want to transition, because I couldn't easily go back. I'd much rather have a second me, instead born as a woman, and then we could hopefully both live separate lives that are equally fulfilling. Alternatively, I wish my body could transition when my mind did, that way I wouldn't ever feel and dysphoria and could just be happy regardless of the situation.  This has been, in itself, therapeutic to write about, but I really can't think of any solution to this issue. Even when I don't identify as multiple people, I still feel my gender shift regularly, and prefer to just believe gender is exclusively a social construct, one that my brain just cannot conform to no less. It makes the most sense that way, and that has helped me a great deal, but when I see things like this, it makes me feel like my solution is just a bandage, and I'll never be as happy as someone who can just, transition to the gender they really are.
In time, it'll all be proven to be biological essentialism, but not fully the way people think of it.  Our brains are chaotic systems (technical sense of deterministic system but with so many inputs that any specific state is effectively unpredictable, but trends in states can be established).  One of the important things about chaotic systems is how important initial conditions are.  During gestation, the fetus is sexed via what's essentially a couple of hormone "washes".  These are highly influential to behavior (makes a lot of sense when you think about brain development and affecting it at this early point) in other mammals to the point where playing around with what hormones are present when will make males behave like females and females behave like males.  Neuroscience is slowly, quietly killing free will.   Part of the problem is this is something that no one wants to let be researched, but give it time.  Here's a highly detailed research article that only talks about this with regard to homosexuality, but check it out and think about it   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_hormones_and_sexual_orientation
Amazing video Contra. You always create such thought provoking content that provides a perspective I don't always think about. Thank you.
Blanchard is gonna blow a fucking casket when he discovers the gonewild reddit forums. Filled to the brim with "autogynophile", mostly cis, mostly straight women. Like, thousands of them.
Wait, are you saying that dogs don't go to heaven?
You had me at Autogynophile Harry Plinket
Um for the intro please just give a warning for the rapid flashing lights for photosensitive epilepsy.
This video is several months old now so I'm not sure if you're even bothering to read comments on it, but some of the things you say in this have made me question myself a bit. I very recently started to identify under the non-binary umbrella (demiboy/demiguy to be specific), but now I'm starting to wonder (again) if I might be a trans woman? I guess what I'm trying to say is thank you for being so open and honest about your experiences.
Am I the only cis woman who sleeps with her bra on?  Thank you for the awesome informational video! ^__^
Thank you so much for making this beautifully honest video -- i aspire to your level of grace, bravery, and wit ❤️
Hey Contra, thank you for making this video! As a cis woman it really helped me to understand your perspective. It sucks that trans people have this pressure to explain and defend themselves in order to be accepted so thanks for being so open! Especially so eloquently and entertainingly.
What really gets me about Blanchard's theory is that it's purposely myopic in that it ignores that we as humans are pre-disposed to seek out the aesthetically pleasing, and that humans are inherently erotic creatures. And even then, these are very broad statements that are open to personal interpretation, with a lot more to them than just "man/woman like touchy rubby feelies". So upon that realisation, Blanchard is lost even further out to sea when he parades a handful of perverted Trans as the smoking gun in his argument.  Or he's projecting his personal sense of shame around male crossdressing as a young boy / sexual attraction to Trans Women, which I honestly think to be more likely given how intensely blinkered his scientific method and ultimate conclusion is.  Upon my own personal realisations on the matter and exposure to others with their own baggage with it too, I learned quickly that dysphoria as general umbrella diagnosis, has far too many nuances and facets to be as simple as black & white. So attempting to use catch-alls and fancy Greek words to convince people that they're mentally deranged, is intellectually egregious of him and his supporters.
HUH, I never heard about that theory before. I always assumed it was more of a female wired brain in mans body. To me with NO training or knowledge on this subject that makes more sense. As the brain is the most importatnt part of the body in my mind a trans man turning into a woman is a women to me. Excuse my lack of awareness and i hope I don't offend anyone. Mayeb I think this way because many TV programs I watche don this subject come from the 90's and often weren't voiced by folk going through transition.
Thank you.  I know that it was horribly difficult to put all that out there in troll land.  It was probably not even near the top of your list of reasons for making this video, but my mind has been ripped open by your raw honesty and my perspective on gender/sexuality shattered into more complex pieces I had never knew existed.  Thank you for the filth.
I know you said You wear a bra to help you sleep, what about a handsome man to be your big spoon?
You’re amazing
Amazingly helpful perspective for this Kinsey 1 CWM.  Given the drastic shift in motivations for sexual arousal, I'm now very curious about the experience of non-binary people.  I mean, academically curious.  I'm not some fetishist that gets off on hearing about how other-gendered people get off.  I think.  Crap.  Is there a neo-greek word for this?
I liked sleeping in a bra for a lot of my life, don't feel alone or weird about it as a woman!
Is it good/bad that I don't understand Blanchard's typology of transwomen AT ALL? Like, it makes my head spin, it sounds like such fantasy.
@ 12:00 unscientific reasons <?. don't let this exist because of the opposite's implied legitimacy. Jesus fucks Christ.
"Sip a beer"? When I listen to an intellectual woman educate myself and others I prefer to sip on cognac and dine on hot pockets. Because I can't afford good cognac AND real food
"I wasn't born a woman, I was born a fucking baby" HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHA
You totally remind me of my niece. Same sarcasm :) . Which is exactly what Blanchard, Bailey, etc. deserve!
Did I go to school with you??? I was NU class of '15
Suddenly I really really *really* don't want to go to Northwestern University...
Amazing - "someday I will be loved by someone who thinks of me as a woman" . Beautifully spoken and that's my hope for you !  I'm a 64 year old post op trans woman and I've never heard anyone take apart the million facets of our motivations to transition with such empathy and style - You rock! I'm also a musician - check out susanrowe.org
You're amazing!
I love this because you're just destroying the TERFs and the SASS gives me life. Also, as a 23 year-old cis woman, I would like to submit my testimony that I have slept with a wired and preformed-cup bra on since around 2012, thank you very much.
I love you mom xxxx
Thank you for contributing to my growing understanding of gender.
I gotta disagree that sexuality is always a motive for a transitioning adult. I'm asexual myself, though I do agree if I did want sex with others, my biology would me a huge stopping point. So I guess I got lucky.
Oh wow, your personal gender identity reminds me a bit of a Transwoman version of myself, if I decided to become a Transman! I don't want to transition, because I'm happy enough with myself as a woman, but BOY does it make me happy, the times strangers "accidentally" assume I'm a male. So I've just settled on being an amorphously genderqueer blob. Boy, girl, I don't know what I prefer most, just think of me as a human, pls.  It's not exactly the same as your experience, of course, but yours is the closest I've heard someone come to an identity like mine.
"Google it!"  ...  Oh no. I don't usually fall for that, but you can't POSSIBLY tease something called "The fuck-saw incident" and not deliver! Damnit! Now I'm sure I'll need brain bleach after I do the googlefu!  Oh well. Bottom's up!
Everyone is a pervert,  everyone
Also many cis women sleep in bras myself included ^_^
I just love you.
U Rock!
thank you for explaining the terminology. It's amazing how trans women are dismissed and perceived as unknowing about themselves, just like cis women, and yet terfs will go on for days about trans women not being like them. Women get shit on equally but the type of shit is in accordance to HOW they are women. Black women get black women tailored shit. Cis women get cis women tailored shit. Trans women get trans women tailored shit. Lesbian women get lesbian women tailored shit. Then there's the intersectionality  of all the different social layers of being a woman. Fucking exhausting. What I find wildly interesting is that trans men don't have this level of scrutiny. It's as if, while not openly admitting it, those who hate trans people automatically treat them as the gender that the trans person presents. The gender binary is so deeply ingrained that cis people are pavlov's dog when presented with the merest of gender expression. While at the same time verbally denying the trans persons identity. BTW, I think you're fabulous.
Hi I'm the pharmacologist at home thanks for the acknowledgement
What about all of the people who claim to be autogynephiles? There seems to be many. The theory seems to be wrong in the sharp distinction between gay/straight transsexuals, since trans peoples' experiences are much more varied.
That was so personal and real. I really really related to your description of how you came to know what you are.
Just to add my own experience. I'm a transman, I am femme. I love makeup (my professional career is such), I care not for clothing designation (I will happily wear dressses and skirts as well as shorts and trousers)
wait wait wait. @33:55 - I certainly get turned on merely by the thought of being a woman, and I for sure touch my breasts during sex (alone or with someone) cis female. Did I miss something? Is Blanchard saying this is not typical?
Just checked out the 'fucksaw' thing. Hmmm.
I used to do the bra thing. I would sleep in my fruit of the loom bra and i woukd take 2 hours of doing my makeup. Now I'm a bit more relaxed due to my acceptance and creation of my own type of femininity.  Even after 2 years of hormones I'm still pretty dysphoric at times. This  channel will help me articulate and defended myself in  public and academic settings. Thank you.
Blanchard... Fuck off. Im personally not trans. But Blanchard isnt trans so he shouldnt speak for them.
I'm must say you are wrong,I must disagree.
Thank you for making this video.
Thanks for this, could relate to alot of your feelings and experiences :)
I know this is an old video and this is wildly off topic but I am a cis woman who ALWAYS sleeps in a bra. I have since I was younger and just feel more comfortable with the support of a sports bra (even I'm not crazy enough to find underwire comfortable) just thought I'd share since it amused me to hear that no cis woman would do that. My wife certainly agrees with not wearing a bra to bed though.
Help, I found out you existed two days ago and I've been stuck in this rabbithole ever since. Thoroughly worthwhile channel on many levels! I'm going to end up watching all these videos twice: once for the witty, insightful, deeply heartfelt commentary, and once to take detailed notes about your interior decorating.
As a "born" woman..? (I don't fucking know), the essential woman thing is not heartwarming to me; it's terrifying. It makes me strongly want to be something else. This video is so interesting. Subscribed.
“You just found a-... you just found a person who built a sex robot.”  Gets me every time
This is really great. It just underscores to me the incredible amount of scrutiny trans women are under at all stages of transition. It stands out to me because it's certainly not the same for trans men. That's not to say there's no scrutiny-- there definitely is-- but it's not something people have devoted so much time to that it becomes a movement or a psuedoscientific field of study. People are out there trying to tear down trans women in every possible way,.
While your channel is great, can we get an episode with an autogynophile Harry plinkett??? I can't get over the idea
:') powerful stuff
I have so much respect for you, thank you for making this video
Quick question - would you consider marrying me
You're awesome. I've only seen a few of your videos so I keep getting confused when I look at your subscription count because my initial assumption is like 1.1 million, and it's not so much about the subjects (as important as they are), but just the across-the-board-quality.  It's fun to watch you play piano and laugh.  I hope you've gotten the fuck you've been yearning for.  Peace!
thank you for articulating thoughts that i’ve had for a long time as a nb person who also reads too much about poststructuralism
This is so brave
"I haven't cum in months someone please fuck me" made me cackle
I, a cis woman, sleep in my bras every single night.  You're not alone and I love you.
Shoutout to Natalie for this one.  I’m nonbinary, so I’m in the weird position of not really relating to either male sex drives or female ones.  I need a narrative, yes, but stuff like 50 Shades has arguably too much narrative.  I don’t need endless description of Grey’s apartment — just the relevant particulars, like his outfit, or the piano if they’re going to fuck on top of it, or whatever has a direct relevance to the sex act.  But I can’t just pop into a sex scene with _no_ establishing setup, you know?  I think I might have some interesting hormonal things going on, just, naturally, so who even knows.  Anyway, this has been a fascinating video!
Vanuatu for the WIN!
wow. this channel is underrated. You're a wicked genius. SUBSCRIBED!
Oxygeneiphilia
Your new female sexuality sounds a lot like my always has been female sexuality (like the things that turn you on while in female hormones have always turned me on the most)... I feel like there's definitely a hormone connection here (I'm still very attracted to you so don't worry about that). Also, when you were talking about the great part of men's bodies I think you forgot about the shoulders/back, those are also great. Men and women's bodies just both have their won great parts. I'm adding to this comment at the end because I am more attracted to you now because of the rocky horror... you're just the best.
the only thing regretable from this amazing video is that those smug sexologists probably wont even know about this because the medium. hearing about their theories alone makes me cringe and so angry lmao. you relay your points really well its unfair how eloquent some people are
Amazing thorough explanation of the issue!  I really enjoy your videos. Good luck :)
Hey, I'm a biological female, and I wear corsets, garter belts and fishnets!  >:[  DEBUNKED Anyway... thanks for making this video.  It really helped me understand how transwomen feel.  It also helped relieve a lot of anxiety I've had.  I have quite a few trans friends (a former boyfriend honestly asked me if I had ANY cis friends at one point), but one friend privately told me that she watched a lot of lesbian porn and fantasized about having lesbian sex quite a bit.  She told me this right as she was preparing to start transitioning.  This theory popped up in my head and I privately worried she would fully transition, then realize that this was all a sexual fantasy and go back to being male and regret the whole thing. This theory is quite toxic, transphobic, and infected me with (unintentional) transphobic thoughts.  If I hadn't known about this theory, I would've come up with a more rational reaction towards my friend's confession.  The logical answer is that she was craving to experience female sexuality, and trying to do that from a male, testosterone-fueled perspective.  Thank you for having the courage to make this video!
First: great video. I literally can't do anything else while your videos are on because it's too distracting. You have the best videos on YouTube, and possibly the internet.  Second: Felt the need to jump in and say that I'm a ciswoman and I sleep in a bra almost every night. *shrug*  You are fine. You are normal. You are magnificent.
Just came to say that you are a beautiful and intelligent young woman, and I 💖 u!!! 🧚‍♂️💃
30:51 EVAN STONE IN THE HOUSE!!!! Thanks for including Evan Stone in your video, ContraPoints.
Great person
AND WAIT TILL YOU SEE MY SEX ROBOT
I'm a cis woman, and I'll sometimes wear a sports bra to bed. It's a double edged sword for me. On the one hand, I really like that it keeps my boobs from effectively flopping about. I like the fact that they are firmer and more shapely in a bra. On the other bloody hand, I hate how the straps feel, and how it feels across my back. It can feel kind of itchy sometimes, or restrictive.  One day, I'd actually really like to get my boobs lifted, at least a little bit. Give them a more aesthetically pleasing shape, and be able to feel comfortable going sans bra on occasion, since I can't at all right now. Guaranteed, I'll be checking myself out in a mirror a lot after that.
the best kind of Good Eats -ish vibes
Well now I have to watch The Rocky Horror Picture Show and Shock Treatment again
Hello ContraPoints, I just wanted to say that I heard about you a long time ago, but I never checked out your vids since I've been so tired of the social justice discourse after it being thrown in my face through five years or so (yeah I'm on Tumblr, no I'm not proud of it). But a couple of days ago one of your vids popped and it had an interesting title. So I clicked and I'm really happy that I did. Your vids are so well researched and produced, and by God they are aesthetic af. Keep it up. I'll go binge watch all of them now <3
I love your videos so much. As a cis bi woman, I've always been sympathetic to trans issues, but because of videos like this I'm able to understand your experiences on a much deeper level - which also makes it easier to shut down judgements and criticisms made by transphobes.  Also you're basically my dream girl 😍
Very insightful, I love your style of commentary if that's what it's called, glad I found your channel
I love you too!
My wife sleeps in a bra.  Bummer for me I guess.    Oh yay I earned a song.
Cool remix of Romeo & Juliet...
Thank you for being brave enough to make this video. This old cis straight guy found it most educational, and I am quite aware that fear of The Other among others of my cohort is the reason that trans and other marginalised people are reluctant to raise their heads above the top of the metaphorical trench.  I also meant to say that I liked the Baroque cadence that you put on the end of '3 TImes a Lady' :-)
This is a very well made video and it's very brave of you to expose so much of yourself. I think this video can help a lot of people to get a small understanding for things that they will never experience for themselves. It's also funny and smart as always!
You like Bailey's Cream? Well you know until now, I supported you and all your videos. But now I don't know what to believe ._.  edit: Okay, you like Rocky Horror, so that makes up for the Bailey's Cream :D
Just know my own perspective, but for me when I sent dick pics it's not that I like my own dick it's that I want girls to like it. I cut that shit out years ago cause I learned that woman don't give a fuck about my dick.  It's kind of like a "please validate my existence/love me" type thing. but nobody likes that kind of pathetic desperate bullshit. haha i should kill myself lol
good job
This is an art piece. You, Natalie, are an art piece.
Despite being a cisgender woman, I feel like you've taught me a lot about how my own gender and sexuality intersect.
Hey, you're half elphaba!
The fact that a lot of autogynephiles will end up dating men does NOT mean that they genuinely love men, it means that that they date men because it's part of what women do. Jeez, the stupidity and naivete.
It is not a wrong theory, it's very real. I can smell and spot autogynephiles immediately, and I can tell them apart from real transsexuals who are attracted to men. Autogynephilia is real.
I think your desirable and want to fuck you
The smile that hit your face after the scentence "you found someone who built a sex robot" had a type of glow, an ambition and seemed to whisper "someday"
11:19 k I googled "fucksaw incident" and like.. excuse me??? I beg your FUCKING pardon??!?!! 💀💀💀
ugh....... cis feminists and their witch stuff really sucks as a trans witch! (:
"It is the assumption that women enjoy looking at themselves in the same way that men enjoy looking at them, and are therefore complicit in their own objectification." I just replayed that three times. Mind blown.
Good news: there are cis women who sleep either in bras or in pyjamas or night gowns with built-in breast support. It tends to be those who have larger breasts because it's painful to do otherwise. So you're not alone in that!
Woman I love you just the way you are 😍🤩💖
You sound like you're demisexual - attracted only in the context of interpersonal connection and attachment. (I'm the same way, it sounds a lot like me.)
I feel like the main reason for the different clusters is that if you're "male" and attracted to men you are already an outsider, more likely to get involved in the LGBTQ community and people will be more accepting of you acting feminine.
I FIND OUT LATER SHE IS FROM BELIZE
This video was so validating... Thanks.
so i just started looking at your channel and i wanted to say thanks for this video. as someone who has a boyfriend whos trans femme (yes i still call them boyfriend even though there non binary) ive found it hard to fully understand there dysphoria especially in relation to sex. i think its mostly because i dont think its fair to have them lay bare all the skeletons in there closet and do all that emotional labor (much like you just did). but i feel like this video helps me (as a cis person) understand the kinda shit they have to go through (as a trans person).
Fucksaw, people.
What an amazing channel! Thank you for it.
"Bailey, are you paying attention to this? This is for you." *Me whos' name is Bailey* (꒪⌓꒪)
My sexual development was late too! I feel less alone :)
As a cis hetero woman, i can affirm that "women arent attracted to the mere sight of a male body". Sure a body is cute, but unless theres movement, action, something going on, there is nothing sexual about it. At least for me, the sight of a guys abs or whatever leaves me completely indifferent if not off putting (im just not into muscular guys personally). Thats why things like dick pics dont do anything for many women and are not very appreciated.
22:04 I would volunteer as tribute but I am asexual and it sucks. Or, rather that it doesn't is the problem.
<3
You are a breath of fresh air among all the YouTube channels about these topics.  Might not always agree (do here though) you take up a very necessary platform.
I just discovered this channel having only briefly been introduced through Lindsay Ellis, and I gotta say, I'm in love. The slowing down and zoom ins during any buzzword like "problematic" fucking slays me every time
Cool Montegue and Capulet remix
"ladies of the subreddit" I screamed
Never heard of autogynephilia before, but it sounds pretty stupid
puberty monster
Your voice is kinda calming and easy to listen to. I like. Blair whites videos but her voice and speaking mannerisms are a bit annoying. Yours is easy to listen to and not annoying, even if it’s right between guy and gal. It’s very nice.
As a gay man, I related a lot to your description of cis female attraction and sexuality. I like to be extremely discerning, be lusted after by many and then get off on being fickle. But then when we get to the bedroom, I like to top. I think I might be the worst.
I am thrilled to have come across your channel and just subscribed.  Thank you so much for opening my heart and mind to a part of life of which I actually know only a tiny bit.  But now I see a little bit more.  Thank you.
Wow, this really painted a vivid picture for me. Thank you for being so open about your experiences. I am a straight male that has always empathized and felt a lot like a female,  sexually and personality-wise. Although I have been a slave to male hormonal obligatory coming, that’s started to fade for me. After my last couple of relationships I’ve become more focused on interpersonal sexual cues, after they’ve ended I’ve tried to return to those visual cues, but it just doesn’t feel the same. I need to feel connected to the person to feel sexually gratified. I’ve always felt and empathized more with females or other feminine males, most of my girlfriends have been close friends that I’ve continued to have a positive and consistent relationship with after. I’ve always loved delving into female fashion and I’ve always fantasized about picking out clothes with a girl, or doing their makeup because they’re traditionally feminine activities that can be intimate and fun. I’m an artist and I like to include partners in the art. I think sensuality is more valuable than sexuality, as did ironically the ancient greeks.  I’ve always entertained the thought of being a woman, but I don’t think I’d ever make the transition, not because of social pressures, but actually despite them. I just want to be an openly feminine man without being seen as gay. I can postulate that this feminine behavior has in part arisen from growing up with two mothers, I’m metro and many people assume that I’m gay. I also look and sound very traditionally masculine. But actually I’m not a big fan of men in general, I would hate to feel attracted to them. I dislike being mistaken for gay of course not because I’m homophobic, but because it’s not who I am. I just want to be seen and accepted for me. My latest ex-girlfriend, one of my best friends to this day, really showed me that that’s really what I wanted. She has shown me a lot about myself, one of the only people, if not the only person I’ve really opened up to about this, she accepted and supported me for it. Unfortunately we’re both in the midst of business and the distance wasn’t all too kind, but I’ve learned a lot. Anyways, this video sort of helped me sort through my thoughts, so thank you!
I think the "Feminine Essence Theory" and its large popularity comes from the fact that the LGBTQ+ community has a lot of trouble getting people to accept them without an "I'm born this way" attitude, regardless of how accurate it is. I've seen and have even had amazing conversations about sexuality and how society affects both how it's expressed and a person's sexual identity itself... but always with other LGBTQ+ people. It's much easier to get straight bigots and potential allies on your side if you explain to them that the bigotry is directed at people for something beyond their control than trying to convince them that this "lifestyle choice" they think it is is okay(and yes, just because it isn't something from birth doesn't mean it's a lifestyle choice, but like I said before, that's a complex conversation that can only be had after the first step to allyship is taken). The latter is so fundamental if someone isn't on board you're probably not going to get anywhere. Later on, you can educate them more about what it means to be your specific identity, but that has to be a slow process or they might reject it since you're basically going back on what you said before about it being a built-in thing instead of a process of self-discovery.
I feel like "I'm Going Home" from Rocky Horror would have been a better ending song. I found the video incredibly elucidating and educational and I can confirm without a shadow of a doubt I could never expose myself even half as much to half the audience.
Cough
"I don't wanna be whistled at by the kind of person that would whistle at me"
I'm in love with you.
I'm sorry, I'ma let you finish, but... your skin looks gorgeous in this video
As a cis women I thought this video was extremely interesting and very true. Made me look at my own bisexuality in a different light
Whoa Whoa Whoa, Hold on a second.  Do you not realize you just moralized sex? Im gonna have to have a drink before I watch the rest of your video. From the beginning its clear that you are not aware of your own biases and are not at least trying to be objective.   So what if someone wants to Transition for sexual relief? Do you not realize that sexuality is also spiritual? You take no issue with assuming that Homosexual men become women to fuck more men, but men who want to fuck a female version of themselves are perverts?   Gonna have to have two drinks before I watch this. I identify as an alcoholic so please don't give me shit for drinking.  Edit after drinking:  Was better than I expected. But I don't think you really disprove Blanchard so much that the model he proposes needs to be developed more. I don't think it should be discounted entirely.
I googled the fucksaw incident and was not disappointed.  But then, dear ContraPoints, you rarely disappoint.
You know, marathoning your channel over the past few days has given me a lot of insight into a guy I grew up with who was assigned female at birth. He came out to me at age 14, and for me, being a fairly conservative Mormon boy--I was confused, like that such a thing would've never occurred to me. So I treated it as kind of 'none of my business', and we actually wound up becoming closer friends (as I started seeing masculine traits in him, and so...felt like we had more in common--plus Mormon teens are not allowed to be close with those of another gender. Too much potential for sex...I guess, and that would be terrible. Man this seems absurd recalling that way of thinking.   Anywho, my friend went by the nickname Dizzy since he was like 9, and I remember how he hated his given name even when we were young. I thought he just didn't like Ashley, and he thought Dizzy sounded cooler. Oh, things. But there's so many things I didn't think about, he didn't make himself out to be butch, but he always wore more traditionally masculine clothing--like jackets with shoulderpads, big jackboots. Despite presenting somewhat androgynous.   He identified as Asexual, and he had a boyfriend all through highschool. A very quiet queer fellow. So coming to this video I was shocked that this theory even exists. Reminds me of Freud's ridiculous idea of penis envy. But that was the 19th century, this is in living memory.   What I liked about him was how he was always so calm and centered. So years later, when I was in college, I came home and hung out with him a few times as he was doing his transition. He got the mastectomy, and started taking the testosterone...and his personality changed a bit. He had a temper, snapped at any perceived slights, moved..agressively. I asked him about it, and he said that he didn't like the side effects influence on his personality, but he wanted a deeper voice, more muscle mass, and facial hair. I imagine he was quite stressed at the time too, fortunately his family was supportive.   I saw him at the high school reunion last year. Didn't even recognize him, a now chubby short guy with a massive beard and short hair. He seemed well, like he was right where he wanted to be. Back to being centered, just a little more vocal--and more gesturous/manspready. So thanks for all your work!
Excellent video x
A fellow Rocky Horror fan too? I do tech and play a Transylvanian for a show in my home town. I didn't think it was possible for me to love this channel any more than I did before seeing this video, but you proved me wrong. <3
It is refreshing to hear some reasonable contrapoints about the subject. You're like a more acidic version of Lindsay Ellis.
Because this term is so hurtful to trans people, I suggest calling the romantic and/or sexual attraction to women femmiphilia.
40:26 - I appreciate this shot, the special effects. That was cool because I didn't expect that sort of editing magic and it kinda took me by surprise to see both subjects in the shot. Neat.
If I hear the word transphobic again, I am going to vomit.
I dunno I wear a bra at night soooo.....
...but....but I wanted science. Science can be filthy. ( ͡°Ĺ̯ ͡° )
Was that mozart at the begining?
Honestly this video is a blessing. Autogynephilia has been a super scary concept for me since I first heard it, because even though it was presented to me in the context as not even remotely credible, it was hard to ignore how neatly I seemed to fit into the definition. After all, the path that led to my transition began with my sexuality and kinks (similar to the image of a woman you mention, though mine involved more context than just that), and that my awakening sexual identity (which up until that point was pretty non-existent) involved a very dominant, arrogant, self-aggrandizing role that I had never been able to embody before, but felt right and empowering. It made me worry that maybe somehow my drive to transition was out of the desire to embody this perfect image of femininity I had in my mind. And in a way, it kinda was, but the thing is, that wasn't a kink, that was just self-actualization. Something that I had been missing so badly that apparently the very idea of getting it was that enticing to me. As I've leaned into my confidence more, and especially now that I live a life where I tend not to have issues passing, the idea has diminished somewhat, but now impostor syndrome rears its ugly head again, worrying that now that I let people assume me to be cis female, that I'm only doing it because of the empowered feeling of being a woman. But again, I think whereas some people might frame that as a sexual thing, that is once again just self-actualization. Anyway, its wonderful seeing someone talking about it and delving so deeply into yourself to put yourself under the microscope, to give a very detailed analysis of all the issues inherent in the insidious way this affects trans people. I'm inspired to make a video on this topic as well with that particular emphasis, tbh.
As a cisgender woman I can confirm that tits are kind of hot even if you were born with them
I transitioned 7 years ago and had SRS 6 years ago and I wish I had the confidence and clarity you just showed in that video back then. I just discovered your channel yesterday (video on incels) and automatically subscribed! I was also often accused  online of suffering from autogynephilia by some men (apparently their sole purpose was to mansplain transexualism to me lol).
i love john berger
isnt he just describing people who are into sissy stuff .....
I'm so glad I found this channel. It's amazing and I love the in-depth dives. I'm kind of late to the party here, but I figured I'd leave a comment anyway! Because, why the hell not?!    Ah, and just as a side note-- I'm a cis woman who's, ahem, well endowed. Much to the chagrin of my boyfriend I almost always sleep with a bra on. 😅 So, there are indeed cis women who sleep with their bras on. It's just more comfortable for me. (It's mostly a physical comfort thing, but there's also probably a weird little dash of rather bizarre insecurity at play too if I'm 100% honest.)
I found this video inspiring. Good job.
From 30:34 is the realest way I've ever had my sexual experience described and I feel like it was not only validating but strangely empowering. I feel like having this clarified in such an eloquent way can help me interact with my internal experiences and my interpersonal romantic/sexual relationships. This whole thing was fantastic and thank you so much for your rawness and your insights.
You should do a Cher take on "Rocky Horror" where you play all the parts.
I would like to add my 2 cents. My ex-girlfriend had tig-ol-bitties. She use to wear a bra to sleep almost every night. She told me that having larger breasts ment a shorter life span of perkyess. She said that by wearing a bra to sleep added support through the night and would keep them younger longer and from doing those things that large breast do after a while. It sounded like a logical reason to me. She didn't always do this but more often than not. After a good session of sweaty belly bumping she would forget or often be too exhausted from my manly robustness to put it on. I like to believe that is why at least.
isn't it odd how the same TERFs who think trans women are pervert men who get off on pretending to be women never think trans men are women who have a fetish for pretending to be men...
I'm a cis woman, and I'm kind of in love with myself. I love my mind, my heart, my strength, my vulnerabilities... I love my face, and how soft my body feels... It's not erotic, but it is sensual. And I can't see anything but good in that. I don't often get lonely because I always have my own company. It doesn't make me look down on other people, because, when you remove the element of competition, you don't need to put other people down. Since I understand others to be selves like me, it's easy to be understanding and non-judgmental. I can definitely still fall in love, and... I think self-love enhances the experience, because there's this element of how the other person makes you feel about yourself that's enjoyable (admittedly, this can get confusing if you're not careful, but if you're self-aware...). On the other hand, you care about yourself enough to not take shit from people. We have a cultural confusion that equates narcissism with self-love. In fact, narcissism is born out of feelings of inadequacy; narcissists cling desperately to this inflated sense of self and need to constantly be reassured of their importance, because they're trying to escape the feeling that they're not good enough.
"The Big Dick Bitch" is trans person who fits into the theory. She is aroused by the idea that straight men view her as a female and also doesnt really have body dysmorphia  like a standard transwoman. But you would think as a transgirl the main thing that would make you feel like less of a woman would be your lady dick ...
This video must have been really hard for you to make. Great job, your videos always look like you put in a lot of effort!
Do a search on Amazon for "sleep bra."  It's a wireless bra that some cis women will sleep in if they have large breasts and fear becoming pendulous from a lack of support during sleep.  Yes.  It really is a thing.
I'm a trans dude and can confirm that my sexuality changed in pretty much the opposite way once started hormones, except that I've also been a 3 on the Kinsey scale.
patient 665321...welly well... ;-)
i don't really agree with you, but this video is pretty fucking good. and as a right leaning straight man, i would fuck you so hard!!!!uugghhhhh!!! call me mike pence.
"Maybe the elder gods ripped my primordial duality in twain and now I'm yearning for my female half... or maybe I'm a woman who wants someone to fuck me every once in a while."... subbed af.
You are very pretty ;D Video was good too I guess
Natalie, you're so intelligent and I can't imagine the emotional toll of uploading so many intimate thoughts and experiences to a cesspit like YT. We really don't deserve your time and effort but I'm grateful you do it anyway.
Cis hetero? male: is it odd I don't mind when my male friends check me out. I find it validating. Is that odd, or do most guys that get checked out by other guys don't like to admit it feels validating for fear of being labeled non-hetronormitive or something?  Being less myopic, being vulnerable, explicitly open to the point you feel you are oversharing, and intellectual critical analysis is the heights of beauty.  You pull it off well.
Sex researcher? More like sex explorer.
💕
I'm cis and I care.
I wear corsets and fishnets aaalll the fucking tiiiiime.
Big tittied nb here. I sometimes sleep with a bra because they just try to choke me when I fall asleep. For real.
Can we talk about listening to Natalie just rambling about her past/beginning her transition in friggin interesting.
Lost it at autogynophile harry plinkett.
15 is late?  Oh... right... there was no internet porn when I was 15.
I dunno, I don't make it a habit of telling other people their business; but I do, as a man, think that a man who wants to go through surgery to be a woman probably wants that because he dreams of being submissive, helpless, dominated, wants the world handed to him on a silver platter... basically has a perverted or fantastical notion of what womanhood is. Being a real human means rolling with the punches and accepting the testicles or ovaries you've been dealt. But that's just my two cents. You do you.
the bailey's cream joke setup and payoff is just stellar.
I love your video for busting trans stereotypes, such as "autogynephilia" and bravely describing your sexuality, which I don't consider filth.  I'm kinky (a switch) but not into feminization, though i've made out with transwomen who were.  I'm just a bi poly transwoman who wants a vagina, likes feet, accents and tattoos and likes to wear black leather and be whipped, spanked, tied up, smeared with chocolate ice cream and to do the same to other women and  men, both trans and cis.  I lived as a woman for years before trying the kink mentioned earlier. Women's wear is just clothes to me, unless it's fetishwear, just like cis women think.  Since I know a lot of vanilla transwomen, I know that transitioning is not a kink but a change of identity.  I also know lots of kinky/poly/nudist cis women, so I don't think of vanilla/monogamous/textile sex as "normal female sexuality."  "Normal" to me just means "not a superhero." That makes everybody normal! Kink is just another way to make out with others. Only serial killers', child molesters and date rapists' sexuality is sick and evil, because it puts their partners in graves, police stations and hospitals. All the other kinks just cause all parties to moan and smoke cigarettes afterward. Transgender is not a mental illness, either. I don't see pink elephants, hear voices or think I'm Napoleon.  I just want a vagina instead of my native penis.  Our mental health issues are reactions to transphobia and living with the wrong private parts and in the wrong identity.  Most of us feel better after SRS.  I was lucky enough to have trans-friendly psychotherapists, which is why I am more functional, happy and well adjusted as a woman than I felt as a man.  Those autogynephilia guys are straight out of Victorian times, without the cool steampunk stuff!
Although a few months late, i would like to state my utmost admiration. The video left me with a baffled feeling  like one can have after watching a truly great movie. Not just for making this topic so insightful, but especially for sharing your personal experiences. Although i wish you didn't have to, it was just great. Deep respect!
I don't know what the quality is, but you're one of the few people I can listen to an actually absorb information from. I get itchy and have to do something else when i'm reading or listening to someone, but not you. Thank you for uploading this extremely informative video.
I thought transgender was when your brain is wired opposite to your sex? Like it's been pretty much proven with brain scans and all that?
That opening theme is way too similar to the Prokofiev Romeo and Juliet.
31:24 So your void inside is filled up by the prospect of your *void inside* being filled up?  I'll see myself out.
Always feel weird on these videos as a theist. Most of the people I watch and agree with on points, like ContraPoints, are atheists. Not what this is about, and this video is amazing. Just had to get that off my chest.
I know a lot of cis and trans women with paraphilias, including myself.  You should see my Fetlife account, lol!  And these guys think I'm a narcissistic man in a dress, just because I'm a bi female switch with a foot fetish??  And I don't like being called a perv??
Me, approximately every five minutes while watching this video: Omg, I LOVE this woman.
so clever, love it
I loved it! Thank you for honesty and revealing introspection.
17:50 >puts on seatbelt >lowers rollercoaster bar
What does all this meandering garbage eventuate to? Who cares.
Can someone explain to me the "this one's on the house, kiwi farmers" joke? I feel like there's a reference (possibly a callback to a previous video I haven't yet gotten around to) that I'm missing. Thanks in advance. :)
Honestly when it comes down to the whole remaining cool, rational and how not all trans ppl can pull that off. I agree with that and I can relate to that a lot. I honestly try to pull that off on a daily basis but then I just realize that me and my shitty mental health is just not capable of remaining calm and calculative through out rational debates for pro longed periods of time. Eventually I'll feel like I am being verbally attack and I will go into panic mode.
Cool vid! Tbh it was rlly interesting bc im a trans guy and idk much abt trans women or that experience. Its cool that u did a video abt this ALSO ur lighting is awesome
32:43 is just... perfection
On a similar note, screw the notion that all cisgender crossdressers are doing it as a fetish. Many just like women's fashion, often lolita/goth fashion.
i sleep on a bra :(
I HAVE BEEN !! 🚨🏳‍🌈🚨T  R  I  G  G  E  R  E  D🚨🏳‍🌈🚨 !!
So is there an academic discussion like this one in regards to trans men?
My GF sleeps in a bra.
That A Clockwork Orange reference. nice
Buffalo Bill wasn't trans though.
Oh NO my name's Abigail HELP
i appreciate the time you took to explain this and how hard it must have been to talk about some of this. i feel like i always want to hear more about the trans experience and im glad that you are here to offer up your perspective on these things. thank you!
The thought I had was: what about trans people who transition and are asexual? Where the heck does he think that factors in?  Also, I find it really hard to understand the idea of transitioning to be attracted to yourself. Myself is the _last_ person in the room I'm going to find attractive, I can assure you! Get that mirror away from me.
I really like your style, Natalie.
I'd say rather than science privileging heterosexual male (sexual or not) perspectives, it naturally privileges the perspective of the given scientist presenting the work, and that many scientists happen to be heterosexual males. That doesn't make allowing bias into research acceptable, but it seems more important to me to focus on the fact that bias is the problem, no matter what that bias is in favor of or against, rather than specifically one form of that bias.  Not that we shouldn't point out specific instances of bias when they occur, I would go so far as to say we must in order to be consistent, but claiming a systematic or broad reaching bias implies a problem of form, rather than of individual failing, which would damage the implementation of the scientific method on false grounds.  Just my hot take.
the character at 30:50 is not a pirate, but a pirate hunter. I know because I watched that film for research purposes many times.
Silence of the Lambs isn’t trying to portray an accurate depiction of transwomen! If you read the book, it even says that Buffalo Bill tried to get sex reassignment surgery but was determined to not be driven by gender dysphoria by the psychology team.
This video is retarded sorry 🅱️
>I haven't cum in seven months  V O L C E L   Q U E E N
So you are saying that the idea there is a female soul or the brain is sexed (which we absolutely know its not, the brain has NOTHING to do with reproduction at all) makes more sense than the doctor who studied the shit longer than any other human alive. Okay... Lol
The mood lighting can be a bit jarring or wash out some of your features at points. But, I see that it adds a dynamic quality between shots without a change to the composition. Do you apply the color lighting as a digital effect or by switching out cel sheets ?
i love you
Oh shit, I googled the fucksaw incident.
What was the song before time warp?
This was absolutely fascinating and you were so open, I loved it! Thank you!
Thank you for sharing so much of yourself. It's a beautiful thing to see.
I'm a bisexual cis woman and I wore fishnets nearly every day in high school. I was obsessed with Rocky horror and my mom finally took me to my first midnight showing when I was 14. She bought me my first fishnets that year, and she got me my first corset when I was 16. It was really cool of my parents to tight lace their 16 year old into a corset in the kitchen at 10:30pm before taking me to meet my friends at the movie theater.
Lmaooo he disproves his own point by admitting his attraction to straight women as a straight man. Brilliant.
Very informative video.
Just looked up the fucksaw incident. Not sure the context of the lecture he was giving for the event, but it seems pretty benign. Though, it is strange.
You're proving Blanchard's theory right.
Wow this was really brave of you to post, it must have been... 45:28 Oh.  Sorry.
I knew John Berger was coming and I got excited
This is a comment on sexuality change after taking hormones and having a 'typically' female sexual response. Are there any sources to the assertion that the need for interpersonal connection and unresponsiveness to visual sexual stimuli is a typical female sexual response? From personal experience I can see that men and women in general respond in different ways sexually, but I doubt what you describe is all that typical. Anecdotally, I'm a biological female and I am purely visual. I don't care much for personal connection, although that can help if the initial sexual attraction isn't there. Plenty of my female friends also talk about being attracted to men in a purely visual way - one spent a year lusting over a guy without ever really speaking to him apart from 'hi' and 'bye' in work, as an example. So sources?
Something got in my eye towards the end there...
This video was unbelievably eye opening and most certainly made me question the internalized misogyny I am still unlearning everyday. It was also the video that shook me enough to realize that I am a trans woman. This was about a month ago, and I have a long way to go before I feel less overwhelmed and more comfortable in the world/my body, but I wanted to type out a long winded thank you for all your content, and being so open with your experiences.
I LOVE YOU
I enjoyed this video very much. I can see how it would be difficult to approach this topic with such candor, but I think you did a wonderful thorough job. Thank you so much for sharing your perspective and your experience.
I'm not particularly wordy,  but your videos are well-done..... and very important.
...What about FtM?
thanks for making these videos.
This was a very insightful video, I must say. I appreciate the openness and really feel I understand the trans people better. Maybe you consider make a video in the future about the real science inquiring the trans phenomenon, like the neuroscientific the endocrine or even the evolutionary perspective (if something like that already exists). You are awesome, by the way.
I'm so in love with the way you talk...both charming and educational.
I told my wife women don't have a sex drive like men do. This video just told me I'm right.
The personal insight was fascinating and informative. thank you.  Also, I enjoy my own body odour. #OdourProud
Actually, I'm cis and also wear a bra to bed. I just don't really like these two fat sacks flopping around my chest as I try to find a comfortable sleeping position.
*played Frank in Rocky Horror* please, marry me
i think it interesting that there is no concept to blanchard that cis autogynophilia  is also an occurring phenomenon
This is a really excellent video and you do a great job at laying out Blanchard’s crazy and addressing it. I’ve subscribed to your channel and look forward to what you do next. I’d personally love to hear your thoughts about asexuality, actually (Blanchard thinks it’s a lie, and so do plenty of other people, but I think you’d do really well discussing it). Thank you!
Honestly I just found this channel, started out with the whole Jordan Peterson video and disagreed with a couple points but I have not stopped laughing. This is so great, please keep it up because I have not found a single video that wasn't well written, funny, well researched, and interestingly edited.
I love you. I love your sense of humor. I love your mood lighting. I love that shirt. I want that shirt. I love the way you talk to me, your viewer, like a human being. I love you!
All you need is one day as a trans woman on hetro tinder and one hour of being an effeminate man on grinder to prove this guys homosexual transexual theory wrong.   If all you want is sex you'll get way more being a gay dude than a trans woman.
this is fascinating, thanks for sharing you freak degenerate
Informative, extremely visually interesting and the script is genius. It was incredible that you choose to share your history, I hope it wasn't too hard. I have some idea of how could be hard to reveal intimate parts of yourself in public. I write thi in English and PT/BR, because I live in Brazil and I am trying to show the impact of your's work.  Informativo, visualmente extremamente interessante e o roteiro é genial. Foi incrível a sua escolha de compartilhar a sua história, eu espero que não tenha sido muito difícil. Eu faço alguma ideia do quão difícil revelar intimidades suas em público pode ser.
Thanks for sharing so much of yourself, and for making a video that’s so well put together, honest, and informative. Also you’re smart and funny and beautiful and likable - I know it only means so much coming from some rando online, let alone in the n-thousandth YouTube comment, but it’s still true. You seem like you’d be a great friend and/or partner to have.
I guess im glad im not the only one that sexually developed late. I didn't have sex until i was 19. before that i didnt care maybe i was A sexual or whatever but it wasnt something i cared about so much. I do love being a woman i love playing with my boobs now and then when im bored lol i think ur awesome contrapoints, ive learned a shit ton watching your vids. i love ur raw honesty.
You're basically my favorite YouTuber right now. I was almost screaming PREACH at the trial part. Love your work :) ❤️
Only thing other thing I have issue with blanchards what about trans asexual women ? I don't think he has an opinion on asexuality
I think people are reading too much into Blanchard's Steven Universe fanfic.
Make a Chanel for stupid piano songs you write
Are you saying dogs don't go to Heaven? _LIAR!_
To corroborate your statement that “More women are into feminising boys...”  I’ve had girlfriends and even just girl friends, put make up on me and do my hair, sometimes being quite forceful about it.  This was before I sagged into my middle aged man body obviously.
I loved this video, but it was very strange to watch with the first name of Bailey
Your my hero
"Someone... please fuck me."  I would, not gonna lie
So I'm autoandrophilic AND autogynephilic (love my dick but I'd rather be treated as a female in bed... mostly) and a trans woman. What a trip!
ContraPoints meets Mr Regular
girl, i fucking love you for legit  f l a y i n g  yourself and dripping ur own guts on the lens so we dont have to.. you r right... it's rly fuckin hard for us trans people to actually defend ourselves when it's so gd painful... of course our defences are lacking-- it's traumatic af. god bless you, darling
your videos have been really powerful for me  even though I was born as a man and pass a man, I've felt very drawn to androgyny ever since I learned about it in an episode from 'House' when I was 16. I am 24 now and still feel quite the same. Maybe it sounds weird coming from a person like me, but I think you're really dope.
Another problem with Blanchard's theory is Masc4Masc isn't dominate among gays.
This was so interesting and well argued, I think the debate about the “nature of femininity” is an interesting and important one and hopefully it will progress with such sharp minds as hers working on it. I’m also not over how pretty she is, my gay, rocky horror loving heart throbs.
It feels almost redundant and patronizing to say this as a cis het white woman, but I genuinely can't believe how brave you had to be to make and publish this video.   I was already with you on the subject of autogynephilia, but hearing about your personal experiences was certainly elucidating, to use your word, and I am grateful for the opportunity to learn more about the subject.
It's for horse back rideing ❤❤❤
Wonderful analysis. Poignant and informed. I look forward to checking out more of your content!
love the lighting on ur nose
You are bae.  Thanks for sharing
This video is such a fucking emotional and intellectual catharsis
Not exactly on topic, but I really enjoyed your comments on narcissism. I've been taking an interest in disability studies and keep running into people saying it shouldn't be an academic field because it's nothing but narcissism. Hearing the other side of this type of argument makes me feel a little more human.
One of my best friends is an asexual trans woman... what's his explanation for that?
Thank you for putting such complicated feels into a tangible combination of words that I can direct people to instead of having to deal with it myself.
39:09
I mean, I totally like to have sex next to a  mirror. Specially since I started working out.
Wonderful video! Clear explanation, balanced discussion and a touch of art! :-) You intrigued me so much that no I'm reading the below linked article about the origins of Bailey's book, the subsequent backlash and related issues. So far, it's a fascinating read, you may want to comment on some of the points? https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170124/
Entertaining, intelligent and courageous. I love  it.
The part at 14:10 when she laughs just...made my day.
Thank you <3
is that the guy from gameranx?
Oh my god what a queer!!
You dug my claws out of the closet. Thanks.
“I FIND OUT LATER THAT SHE IS FROM BELIZE”
Absolutely love you and your channel!
Are you familiar with
i connect with the part about women trying to feminize you. I got a large number of messages on fetlife about that, and I had no interest in that as a kink. I just wanted to be feminine. It wasn't a game of dressup or an extention of humiliation play.  I think that was kind of the turning point where I actually became certain about being trans.
TIL! The whole "essential nature" seems silly, but I admit I had no other hypothesis or useful understanding of transsexuality. After all, no one has an "innate slave nature" so Plato was clearly on the wrong track.There are some questions that warrant discussion about some kind of definition of human nature or the human condition that applies to all human beings, if not all sophonts (is there a more useful word for that?) possessing moral personhood. Whether or not being a thinking entity is itself such personhood also warrants a good, hard, debating.But the video's not over.Back to learning!EDIT: More learning! Nothing much else to say except that I need another musical number. I need it like I need air. That's fun as hell.
So Bailey also has a study saying bisexual men dont really exist and in CBS article they refer to him not being a reliable source and referencing his book you mention here.
You openly asked us for pychoanalysis, so her I go:  Bailey sounds like he is just attracted to women and transwomen, and was genuinely confused by transwomen that were not into him. Just like most men who are genuinely confused by women and their motivations sexually and in relationships.
love you
You should be on bill Maher
What’s the name of the intro song?
WAKE ME UP INSIDE CONTRAPOINTS
Confession: the first ContraPoints video I saw was "The West." (I go reverse-chronologically.) The Midsummer cosplay intro gave me a pang. I felt mocked. I had to correct myself that showing femininity is not an accusation. (I'm cis.) I never understood what the TERF motivation was. I'm ashamed that a pang may be where it starts. It's bound to result from buying into the commodification or codification of the feminine.   But strength should not be conflated with being Un-Sexed. (Looking at you, nineties girlpower.) And Natalie Angier's Woman: An Intimate Geography would have some words for the uselessness of chromosomal definitions. The discourse/TakeWorld is exhausting. I haven't commented on anything publicly for years. But if Natalie ContraPoints gives me that sweet, sweet content, she deserves my confession and testimonial. Natalie is authentic, authoritative, and easy on the eyes and soul. Many thanks.
I never would have guessed I'd hear Falcon's voice outside of gaming YouTube. Much love fam.
You are so brilliant and I'm so grateful for your channel! 💖
I almost never comment. Let this be the time, to congtatulate you. As a cis woman, growing up in a really conservative environment, your vid was all the honest, intelligent, visually entertaining, thought provoking, and in the best of ways, *problematic* for my upbringing. As a bisexual feminist, it's impressive how your videos have helped me realize several of my own contradicting behaviors, and helping me become a better critic, less judgamental. Thanks.
No. The mirror in paintings symbolizes how women know men are visual and as a result spend every waking day working on their appearance for fear of not being valued. '  Which is just a reality of life. How men spend all day working on their swag and status to get women.
Damn. I'm an ex-semi-terf thinking I'm maybe a trans man now, having watched your videos (and others).  Problematicccccc...... love your videos!!
"A lot of women are into feminizing men."  Yep. If you're one of those guys that looks 19-22 forever, women will act really weird and break out the weird shit a lot. Stop it!
I think all transsexuals have mental problems because they need to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria in order to be properly diagnosed, I think. And anyone who thinks that isn't a big deal is naive. Body dysmorphia of all types are pretty awful and are the main drive for most eating disorders or for people with severe self esteem problems.   Meaning, pushing people to have sex surgeries because they "feel they're a woman" is actually pretty dark in a lot of ways. As it accepts a form of dysmorphia as normal.
Wait, were you in the Sonic Transducers shadow cast?
Yo, women sleep in bras because titties are heavy though.
I'm just super glad that I found another YouTuber who realizes that gender=\=sex. Really interesting video!
A technology has been discovered (used for a billion years in nature) that is to genetic engineering what the browser and search engine is to The Internet.  A major breakthrough has in genetic engineering and has given medical researchers unpreceded exacting control to control the human genome, using this CRISPR process to cure diseases.   In Queensland researchers at the CARP institution are approx 12-18 months from commencing human trials on their anti-ageing/anti-cancer pill using this exacting control over the human genome. https://www.carp.org.au/our-mission  I have read through their experiment abstractions (I study genomic computation UCSanDiegoX: CSE181.1x) and formed the opinion that they are on the path to the fountain of youth. This could have major implications for your field.  Thank you, Kane Waterworth
As a pansexual cis male I admit you are the first one to trully manage to educate ( and fuck yeah entertain) me in matters of gender and sexuality. Thank you so much for you work.  Thanks for opening that much  and working on a fuckin one hour movie with several characters and music and shit. U rock. I mean really. Learned more today with like 8 videos from you than basically my whole life.   You are possibly the most inteligent and tallented person on youtube by now and  a key peice in my process of self  discovery. Thank you . Seriously.  Ps your bob dylan/ taylor swift impression made made day.
All humans are sexual beings. They all have sexual drives and these drives leads to sexual fantasies . All people organize their life around who they are in these fantasies !!!! They use much energy and time to get ride of the drives, via sexuality, via fantasies and via a gendered social life.  Hence, AG is a human feeling that all people who are female in fantasies have. You expect trans to be turned of by the idea of being men to be be really trans ?  Being female in all fantasies means that you work mentally in a feminine way. You have feminine drives and you get rid of them in a feminine way.  This is simple.   My 3 shrinks agree on this. 2 of them didn't even know about Blanchard and didn't care about him or the DSM !!! And they have seen hundreds of trans other the last 20 years !
FUCK GENDER ESSENCE THEORIES.  I hate when I'm talking to someone and they speak seriously about masculine and feminine energies as if they're absolute.   "Wow, you're giving off such a masculine energy to me." -Man Who Didn't Like I Was Assertive and Femme
You're not doing yourself or this video a service by reading book sections in the way you (or someone else) do.
Everytime I watch a video like this of yours I keep finding I'm in the same place you were at my age, it is making me question if I am trans tbh.
Thanks for this. My trans brother has been ostracized and disowned by a large portion of his family for a few years now, and even though this was mostly about being a transwoman, it was nuanced, and honest, and thorough, and it was very helpful despite the differences.
the fuck. it actually took me about a day to watch this video because i had to stop to think about what you said, look up words, stop to go out and drink, go back, watch again, have a bowl of muesli, sleep (not in that order) and watch it again again just to really take in every point and in the end i feel like there is an entire world of discourse that sounds like it's perfectly clear and familiar to you and I have no fucking idea whatsoever about. And there are lots of other things you said in other videos that give me that same impression. And here i was thinking i was pretty well equipped with arguments and corresponding counter-arguments but apparently i don't know shit. but yeah, great fucking work. obviously you know your lighting is fantastic but yeah, it really is
I am trying SO HARD to figure out how to incorporate your points into my public school classroom and - just, mm mm MMN, thank you for giving us so much to CHEW on.
Amazing, enlightening video! There have always been things I haven't been able to relate or empathise with trans people about. I've made an effort to try to just accept and respect them regardless. After watching this, I honestly feel like I'm closer to understanding than I was before. Thank you.
screams in disphoria
I think one of the big problems with rejecting Blanchard is that to transition from male to female you have to establish what exactly those terms mean outside simple biology. An essentialist view of feminine essence is perfectly valid but most tranners just try to hand wave it away with no actual solid explaination.
Wow I can’t belive 1min in and I’m already broken beyond repair
And your patient#655321 part sounds pretty  much the same as mine but I did 'make' myself more masculine from the shame a lot earlier and because I wanted to get girls even though I always felt different..
I'm so sad - this video is skipping like wild. :'(
As a cis bi woman, the description of female sexuality in this video has helped me understand why I don't fancy men in the same way I fancy women (which is more visual and closer to your description of male sexuality).
48 mins? this a whole movie
*You sleep in a bra?* I only do that when my boobs are sensitive during growth spurts. Oh and I used to do that as an autogynophilic cross dressing cis white male exercising privilege.
*I was group B but I'm more like group A in that I'm younger attracted to men (women as a man) and present well as a women. I always tried to come up with two groups like this but without including the ignorance. There is more like a spectrum.*
*MY TRANSITIONING HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH SEX.* I'm not even into sex that much. i mainly do it because it pleases my boyfriend. Before transitioning I wasn't crazy about sex either. I actually have less sex now because I don't feel pressured to do it.
Thank you.
It's interesting to see the perspective of a transexual.  Still confused, but eh.
The structure of your essays gets me rock hard. You opened up with an actual fucking thesis statement on youtube, so hot.
Huh. I was not familiar with the term itself before checking out your video. But the more I listened to Blanchard's prattle, the more my eyes began to roll as the familiarity of it set in and I soon found myself thinking, "Ah. This shite." I had not been aware that there was a name for it. Great video from start to finish, highlighted by a courageous personal self exploration and a sweet song that brought an about instant smile. ^ _ ^ *applauds* Bravo.
You blew my mind. So brave. And no, I don't think it is reasonable for anyone to be expect other trans people to do this. Seriously so brave. I am so confused...
It's pretty bad that you associate with Peter Coffin, the creep that made up a woman to flirt with him online.
Autogynephilia probably applies to some people claiming to be trans, and it's the duty of doctors and therapist to identify them so they don't get surgery or hormones.
This was so beautiful, interesting and brave. You are so beautiful, interesting and brave. I was completely new to the term autogyn- but I do find myself heavily relating to it, while being very disgusted by it's implications in the context for my transfemme friends. I'm a cis queer pro domme for work and for fun, and I have to say that a huge aspect of my sadism is driven by a vicarious masochism, a wish to see myself being the daddy I wish I could have in my sex life (but I can't bc I have to refract those urges through the other to get off for some reason). It's weird. It's complicated. These things just are for some I suppose, more so for others.   Your incisive rhetoric is always a joy to hear. Your constant refrain of wishing for beauty and the gesture towards truth is so inspiring. I f"*&ing adore you.
is there a single one of these anti trans "skeptics" that doesn't type all their theories one handed
really great peice - well done. Also I am a v weird person in an unavoidably womany body. I like garters, and fishnets, and corsets (oh my!!). i definitely think i exist.
Oh but. Ace trans people exist. People can change genders without sexuality being involved (though it’s obviously not bad if it is)
Debunking the feminine essence theory was so interesting and really helped my thinking on gender as s product of agency. Thank you!!!
Ur the cutest!!!!!
The way you move your eyebrows is so cute
I was born a female but I always felt like I was supposed to be male growing up. However, unaware of the possibility to transition, I learned to be a woman and I am now at the point where I am somehow both. I would transition but then I feel like I would be betraying the part of me that has become female, however I can't stay female because that means I am betraying the part of me that is male. I'm still trying to figure things out and I hate that it has taken me to long to get all these crazy feelings sorted. Currently I call myself Genderfluid because that seemed the best description of my constantly changing perception of self. I found this video to even affirm those feelings as with your description of "normal sexuality" between sexes I found that I mostly fall into the male category but also the female category. I'm not sure why I'm writing this, I usually disregard people who post long personal antidotes, however I felt the need to express myself. In conclusion I suppose, I loved your video, I love your work, and gosh darn it I love you lol. Keep it up Contra!
43:41  hard relate
If you were born an woman you wouldn't have had to lip sink the video.
Bit of an tangent, but I fancy myself something of an artist and I thought you might get a kick from knowing that your playing with colored lighting has helped me study color theory and value.
Thank you thank you thank you for existing Contra! Your videos give me such great insight into my girlfriend's experience as a trans woman (who hasn't transitioned yet, she's just barely looking into it but she's a beautiful girl already, I like to think she's just hiding.). I know a lot of the things you talk about from her, like male sexuality being a demon and female hormones alleviating it. But you can word things so wonderfully. I hope this video didn't get you into too much trouble. I love you Natalie!
Contra you have such a cute smile and giggle!
"And I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me." - I bet that would sell reasonably well as a t-shirt.
Empirical observations: "Hot. Not. Not. Hot. Hot. Not."
I sleep with my bra too ! ... Well, I mostly fall asleep in front of my computer, forget the bra and then wake up the morning with drool on the keyboard and a terrible backache... The bed is too far anyway... Like 30 cm too far... One more video... Just one more... *snooore*
Srly, you're objectively a phenomenon. You're a mass of concentrated awesomesauce in fancy dresses.
The fucksaw scandal that rocked Northwestern University to its very foundations, in which a psychology professor innocently hosted a demonstration of a motorized sex toy on a woman in front of 100 gape-jawed students, has reached its sad yet inevitable conclusion: Professor Michael Bailey's human sexuality class will no longer be offered at the school. . . . . . . . oh
If anything the "clusters" seem like they describe stereotypical straight girls & lesbians or perhaps girly girl. vs tomboy, which of course not everyone falls in.
There are actually a fair number of cis women who wear bras to sleep at night. Either because it provides support, or their nipples are sensitive so not wearing a bra makes them uncomfortable, or they simply seem no reason not to wear one. I never really understood people who said wearing a bra hurts. It's comfortable so I don't see a point in taking it on and putting it off multiple times a day.
"But maybe, lots of things."  Natalie (don't even know if that's how I should call you, but hell, I found this channel by watching Lindsay's Marxism! video and screw the deadlines on my life, I've binge watched you as fuck - this is the best thing this experiment called the interned has provided me in ages), you are brilliant. You are brilliant in a dangerous kinda way, and I can't help but love it and think you are amazing by being dangerously brilliant.  Truth be told, maybe I've seen little of all your content. But there isn't a single bit of whatever I've experienced in the last hours that wasn't true to the core.  Let me tell you, if you would take the time to read it, where I'm coming from.   I'm a psychologist cis man from a third world country that's slowly but almost certainly marching its way to what I believe will be a religious dictatorship, politically left-inclined and sexually living a kinda of a crisis (who isn't, the cynic in me wants to ask?) . And although I am not in the clinic practice right now, I'd love to recommend your content to a whole bunch of people I got contact with. For a whole lot of reasons, but the brunt of it is that you can really get a point across, and that has to do with experience and honesty.   You got it all, girl - technique, rhetoric, knowledge... it's a little bit strange to say that I'm amazed that you can bleed your experience into something so strong to tackle such thorny subjects, but I'm incredibly, quite grateful that you are doing what you are doing. You're amazing, and your thing can reach... I don't even know where you could reach.  I'm just thankful I've found your channel.
This is such a fascinating video, as a cis lesbian only recently joining the community it's given me insight into a part of trans women's experiences that i wouldn't of otherwise known about. Thank you so much for sharing this, i think now i have a place to start understanding other people's experiences withing the community. Keep truckin', sister!! <3
Thank you so much for your video and talking so frankly about your experiences. I started watching your videos to learn more about gender and to better understand transgender people.  I didn't expect to not only learn new things but also feel so much empathy... This one and the one about gender dysphoria we're so moving... I just wanted to give you a hug...
I'm glad you made the connection between transgender people trying different clothing to teenagers trying out different styles. It's always appeared to be serve the same purpose: developing an identity. Also, mad respect to you for so candidly discussing incredibly personal shit with sharks on the internet.
My favourite little gifty from this one is the way she expresses what is sexy to a woman (which I do believe is often just as important to men or other genders, but you get the meaning) - that one wants to be wanted by someone with qualifications and discernment. Good words. Astute observation. And as a bi woman, I find her very sexy. What discerning person, of any gender, wouldn't find our lady attractive?
Natalie you are a beautiful, intelligent and witty woman and if I knew you in person, I may well be in love with you.
I do not believe in heaven, but, bullshit! All dogs do go to heaven!  Good stuff though, my sister turned me on to you and I’m really liking the content, homie.
as a cis woman with small boobs--- i've spent most of my life wearing bras to bed :P
Your description of normal female sexuality is surprisingly resonant with me (a pansexual cis man, as far as I can currently tell). Thank you for explaining this topic the way you did. I keep finding your videos interesting and useful, even in ways I wouldn't have expected beforehand.
Autogynephiles, aka - pedos in drag.
Man, I fucking hate being a trans woman. Life is damn depressing
This video is important in a way few YouTube videos are.
I am a cis male (bisexual). I guess I've noticed how decidedly androgynous my sexuality is. It's not entirely about the sensation, but the feeling of being wanted, to be sought after. It's fucking great. Although, yes, I do have physical lust, but it's kind of 50/50. Sex is to me is a balance between "how hot it is that they get turned on by me," and "what they're doing to me feels so nice". I don't know, sexuality's isn't so cut and dry, I suppose.
3:47 I died so hard I had to stop the video for a minute. Great content, keep it up! Subbed
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE SEXUALITIES (or I suppose the influence estrogen vs testosterone has on the human sexual experience) NEEDS TO BE TAUGHT IN ALL SCHOOLS.
"And I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who'd whistle at me." - universal truth, right there.
Contra, you're an icon
Her smile is so beautiful! It makes me feel all warm inside.
Wait.... is that.... is that a scientific way that people talk about the differences between female attraction and male attraction?  That male lust is objectifying and female lust is more based on interpersonal stuff?  Or is that more just Natalie describing her own personal experience?  Cuz I have been thinking A LOT about sex and gender and the differences lately and that is throwing me off a little as I find that when fantasizing my own inhibitions are certainly more objectifying, but in my personal life in the real world it is very much more about interpersonal connections hence why 75 percent of the things I am interested in in a pornographic context are things that I would never be interested in actually doing.  Somebody help me out here.
The dick pic phenomenon baffles me. Eew THere is no normal female sexuality. They go in every direction...it'll be rad when society catches up and they can let it out.
You're telling me this guy isn't "autogynephillic"? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaDYuyuWvPc&t=49s
You are so smart. ❤️
Thanks for the video, you help me with self-discovery, internal struggles and my overall (painful lol) intrapersonal relationship so much more than you know... or maybe you do know lol. Thanks either way. I'll always take your's and other's gender preferences seriously, even if I can't figure myself out lol. Love your work, <3
If something is fixed by, say, age 3, by poorly-understood factors, and hard to modify after that, it's neither a choice, but nor is it necessarily genetic, or some mystical essence, or whatever. Sexuality, gender, and the like, are all social constructs, but they're ones that are pushed on children very, very early on, so if  they're  fixed by a certain  point in the child's development for that child, it does seem that "it's fixed by age X"  is a reasonable theory. There's probably some genetic influence, but... twins can have different gender identification and sexuality, so it can't just be that.   But in any case, it shouldn't MATTER. Gender dysphoria's cause doesn't matter, the suffering caused by it does. Homosexuality's cause doesn't matter, not punishing people for who they love does.     The worse thing about the autogynephilia theory, in my, admittedly, non-trans view, is that it turns something where there's an obvious action - they're suffering (from gender dysphoria), of course we should help them, and as it's medically treatable, insurance should cover it.. - into a kink (a.g.p) or the equivalent of a boob job to get more men to like you (the homosexual twinks) and lets it be trivialised and lets people ignore the insurance aspects.   It's the equivalent of declaring depression "anhedoniaphilia", an attraction to not feeling things, and then denyng depressed people help.
Dammit, Natalie, you're really fucking brave.     Showing your Rocky Horror pics to the Internet, that takes quite a lot of courage
"The original narrator of this channel was going to be like an autogynephilc mr. plinket"  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
You are really fucking smart, really brave, and clever. I'm subbing to your channel and cheering you on -thanks for doing what you do.
As a saphic bitch, youre gorgeous. Im proud of you for making this.
I realized I was more nonbinary than I realized in this video.
@ContraPoints You've gone social full time? I'm so happy for you! :D Here's hoping I can do the same in a few months.
"You can slap a greek word on anything and make it sound fake, scary and pathological" LMFAO. I love you so much
You have a superb mind and your art is significant and will endure
That was really brave.
Googles as instructed...Who designed that thing, Tim Allen?
I've never heard of Autogynephilia but I have had a similar thought and it seemed solid because of how unfalsifiable it was. But you had some very good points about what happens when you use women as a control group and how the fetishizing of womanhood disappears after transition but the appeal of being a woman remains. My follow up question would be why can't you act, look, and be treated like a woman while identifying as a man. That may seem pretty silly to you. But because sex is the more binary thing and is easier to identify in animals it makes more sense to identify ourselves and others with sex. But also recognize that there is no one correct way to perform a sex and gender is no more than a stereotype which is only useful for describing how a culture currently performs a sex (although masculinity will always be associated with the hormone that causes penises: testosterone and tendencies associated with that and similarly femininity with vaginas and estrogen) You want to be treated as feminine because you are feminine and I get that. But to no longer identify as male seems to be saying males (the sex) cannot be primarily feminine as in that is the wrong way to perform that sex. What Im saying is we can really only know our sex and gender isn't a useful tool for identity no more than racial stereotypes help people from certain ethic backgrounds (although this analogy falls apart because race isn't a thing that actual exists while sex is something that we can identify in animals)
Wow the Greek disorder generator would be an awesome app. I won't what Arin Hanson would be if you plugged him in?
This made me think about a lot of stuff. While I'm a guy, I read a total s***load of yuri (lesbian) manga, and watch yuri anime, and have since basically I discovered Marimite at an anime convention in 2004. That's not to say I don't ever watch or read het stuff, but my go-to is stuff about lesbians and out of that the stuff I like best is often written by lesbians. And the porn I'm into isn't the same thing at all... But what you said about the sex drive being like "possession" really resonates, and it really doesn't match my romantic fantasies? That's not to say I'm trans (well I don't think so?) but more that the role of the male is really stifling and uncomfortable to me. I don't really get what I'm supposed to be like and I'm still not sure what I even WANT to be like. I'm glad that you found your path, I'm 37 and I often feel like changing anything in any real way is hopeless... I'm still trying though.
nice slicing sounds in the background 🙉🙈
Fascinating. As usual, she is informative and hilarious. ContraPoints has absolutely nailed the education-with-a-sense-of-humor thing. Keep 'em coming!
had this on my "watch later" list, simply due to the length, not the possible content. very glad i finally had the time to watch (and that i didn't spend that time doing something pointless from which i learned nothing) it was worth every second. thank you!
You're fucking brilliant and I'm pretty sure I have a girl crush on you.
I had never heard of this theory.  It needs to be throat punched.  I like your look at it a lot better, but yeah not even 'clusters' cover everyone.  Also your vids are awesome.   And so are you. :)
I enjoy the smell of my own farts.  Real talk.
You sound so confident and unbothered by triggers. Is it your natural thing, or you were always that leveled in terms of emotions?
As much as I usually disagree with you Contra.. I relate so hard to what you said about 16 minutes in about the female essence being jibberish but sometimes you just have to over-simplify it for dafties.  Holy shit... Your explanation of yourself is the first and only story from a transperson I have related to, so thank you for that. I don't relate to the queer community part, but the rest was almost completely my own experience..
I'm sure "Autogynephilia" was first described by some cooky Weimar-era German sexologist, but can find no reference to this. (As I was searching for him, I did however come across a huge amount of material/ book references shouting that trans is a delusion.  But why IS so much energy going into attacking  transgenderism? What is driving opponents?) I also think that autogynephilia is a pernicious idea: certainly makes me feel like there's some creepy psycho inside.
Okay, I finally need to write a gushingly adoring YouTube comment to you.  THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DO. You not only make me laugh, raise a lot of really interesting points, express the thoughts I have far clearer than I ever could, but you make me feel more okay being me. I'm a cis woman. I love corsets, fishnet tights, covering my face in glitter, and I love being eccentric and seeking attention (Oh, and Rocky Horror). And I sometimes feel like I think like a man, and that's okay. I wish I could just be fully open about what I'm like, and seeing the way you lay yourself bare on YouTube while also having fun pretending you're a pink-haired TERF brandishing a riding crop... it honestly inspires me.  I sometimes sleep in a bra, but that's because I've fallen asleep fully clothed and I'm sometimes still wearing shoes and make up and hairclips. Whoop whoop, chronic fatigue.
I didn't know until this moment how badly I need Peter Coffin in my life.
Nat I do have a few questions. Do Autogynephiles even exist? Why do I feel like that my feelings of being Trans and the Dysphoria now personified after concluding I must be Transgender was a derivation of fetish rather than the fetish a derivation of Dysphoria?
Great content, as always, Natalie.  We know it's not easy being this brutally honest and open.
Looking back at this video, I want to say thank you for making it. Even though you and I are opposites in a sense, I recognized some of my own childhood experiences in yours. Lack of masculinity or femininity, a late sexual awakening (especially compared to my other female peers, with most of them losing their virginity by sophomore year of high school while I didn't even dare to think about anything close until I was 16), and an early experience in playing as the opposite sex that felt more than enjoyable. I want to thank you for helping me realize that I'm a transgender man, even if that wasn't anywhere near what you were aiming for.
I transitioned a decade ago (as of last year) and I completely agree. :)
In 2011, Bailey's human sexuality class at Northwestern made the headlines of major news organizations after he allowed a female guest speaker and her male partner to perform an impromptu live mechanized sex toy demonstration using a "fucksaw"[54][55]—a modified reciprocating saw[56] converted into a sex toy by attaching a "phallic object" instead of a blade[57][58]—to bring the woman to orgasm in front the audience.[55][56] Students were advised beforehand of the nature of the demonstration in this optional after-class event on kinky sex and female orgasm.[57][58]
What do you mean by "assigned birth sex?"  One's sex isn't "assigned". It's observed and noted.
OOOOOOOOMMMMGGGGG THE FUCKSAW INCIDENT .... WHY DID I DROP OUT OF UNI, OR AT LEAST NOT GO TO YOURS AFTER I DID HAHAHAAHAAHAAA
Thank you for sharing and making such an informative video that cis-men like me can understand the experience of trans-women. Such a fascinating watch.
Kind of mad that Gender Critical Contra is such a babe
you do pretty much rule.
As a nonbinary lesbian, I think you are very attractive and I love how much more comfortable you seem as a woman than you did when presenting as a man. I'm a top, but I'm also a ghost, so I don't know how that would work.
i would love to help you release some poison! teehee
I love your delivery. Thanks for the informative video. It truly helps my understanding of transgender women and how to better listen and help them as an ally. Kudos! 💟
44:33 I'm a cis woman and, as a pubescent pre-teen into early teenager, I used to sleep in a bra as well and I also did it because I was uncomfortable with my chest as well. But we have different reasons for the discomfort, I was wholly opposed to growing breasts and you seem wholly opposed to not having them. I also know a lot of cis women who slept in their bras in their early stages of puberty, which once could arguably say you're going through now. Cis and trans women really aren't that different in their behavior.
Thank you for sharing your experience.  Watching your videos has been really eye opening and I want everyone to watch them.
*BACHhhh* An American correctly pronounsing foreign names is a huge turn on :'D
you shouldn't worry about the sleeping in a bra thing. I wear a soft elastic one to bed every night personally cus it's more comfortable and helps avoid stanky underboob sweat issues.
Breaking news: Psychologist said a bunch of stupid shit and got jerked off by other academics over it. What a surprise!
As a trans man, I always felt like I was missing out on the perspective of my trans sisters in the community on the complicated, humiliating, and degrading way society treats trans women. Though I know the labels used to describe trans women and their experiences as women to be harmful and cruel, I never had the words to explain properly what made me uncomfortable about it to my straight cis friends. I don't know a whole lot about the experiences of trans women, but i am trying very hard to learn more so I can be a better leader of the LGBT group at my college. If you're ever in the midwest and would like a paid gig to speak at a school, just hit me up, we'd love to have you!! Last semester we had someone come in and talk about trans voice therapy and her experiences, and it was just as enlightening as this was. I  know this is a long shot, but I'd love some book recommendations so I can better stock the library in our office, or just the chance to talk! anyway, I hope you are doing well and that you find more things to enjoy about yourself everyday.
Is it possible to start having confusing dysphoric feelings as an adult? Like if there were no previous feelings like this before say 17-18 but after that they start taking place? and how would one investigate those feelings?
I know you even said in your video that Cluster A and Cluster B aren't especially scientific, but as a freshly hatched egg, realizing that this was even a group, and that I'm not just some... weirdo... is very, very comforting. Also as tough as it was for you to talk about, so much of your personal experiences mirror my own. (We're even born the same year.) So, just... thank you for making this. I'm in a weirdly muddled place, pre-everything, but stuff like this keeps me breathing. Don't stop.
Great video. Being trans is so big and scary. It can be hard to deal with it all. You have to deal with yourself multiple times in a sense. Not only are you treading through a second puberty and getting a grasp on yourself and who you are,  but you have to deal with being trans to begin with. You kinda become at odds with yourself. "Why do I do this?" You can both knows the answer, but be terrified by the intangibility of that answer. You said it. You want to analyze yourself, but your afraid that by doing so, you might present something that appears as incriminating to haters.   One thing I think the world needs to understand is that I don't know what being trans is. I don't know what I'm doing. I just know it makes me happy. I don't have all the answers.   My story is a bit different from yours. And autogynephilia has always been a topic of interest. Your video helped clear some of the haze. Thank you.
I'm a cis (or a bit genderfluid) bisexual girl and I think you're amazingly attractive. Very feminine and gorgeous, I wish I had a girlfriend like you. Sorry if this sounds inpolite, I'm just in absolute awe.
1:57 Where's that clip from? I kind of liked the music
Is it just me or does the guy who's reading the quotes from the book sound like the Cinema Snob?
Wow this is nutz. I never knew anything about this
This is actually one of the bravest things I have ever seen on YouTube. It gave me so much insight into the trans experience that I likely would have never received as a cis man. I want to thank you for doing something that should never be asked of anyone for the sake of a better common understanding. Keep being apologetically you.
Have you ever seen Ty Turner’s video on why he believes that silence of the lambs isn’t transphobic. I would really like to see what you think about it, keep up the great work :)
Looked up the fucksaw incident and genuinely laughed out loud
Thanks, I really apricated just a person being brave enough to take a really deep look inside. I really resonated with the idea of feeling like a monster and using that as a sort of disguise (adjusts mask) I think I really need to do something creative myself soon.
10/10 video hell yeah
blanchard gets off on tf porn and thats a fact for anyone who came up w autogynephilia
I don’t think the term “autogynephilia” is totally useless. I, as a cisgender male, use it to describe myself because some of my sexual fantasies are from a female perspective.
What an amazing channel!  :D
YOure one of my favorite person (of the persons that I have had not a really interaction with)
The bra thing my friend is cis and wears her bra to sleep. I am non binary in a female body I wear my sports bra to sleep because it keeps my boobs from being uncomfy.
<3
This made me much more aware of the effects of hormone therapy. Interesting
I have been binge watching your videos and I goddamn love your style. So many thoughts came to mind watching this. First off,I need a sex robot but I can work out what kind of depraved that makes me because I'm not wholly decided on the what gender are you question. I identify with women because it's politically useful because everyone thinks I am one but I didn't really ask for a gender and don't want one. Second, your humor is on point and still manages to make me think. Thirdly, I'm sorry you've got to live with the constant scrutiny and self doubt. I think you're beautiful!
"I used to date ciswomen.  I know what they do."  is probably the best thing I've ever heard said
Thank you Contra for posting thisl
You are magnificent. This was illuminating and funny and moving. I am gulping and was struggling to hold tears in at some points. Also I wanted to say that I am fighting slightly with my girlfriend on who's more in love with you.
I find it funny that that book's cover initially looks just like "Quiet" by Susan Cain.
So the other model according to the essay in the description is gender-variance. Meaning sex vs gender identity vs gender expression vs sexuality are all separate.
+
The problem with your argument is that it assumes everyone agrees upon calling transwomen "women" and not "men in dresses"
this is a masterpiece
Thank you for being you.
∼As a single *inhales* ∼heterosexual maaaaaaaaan∼...
Funnily enough, when I was first finding out that Trans was actually a thing (high school, early-mid 2000s), I did that questioning thing and it was noticing there were buried parts of me that had bents that could be described as autogynephelic was how I realized I was in fact NOT Trans.   I've done more thinking in the intervening years and I'm in that place where I call myself "Straight Cis-Male" because it's easier than going into full detail on how it's not quiiiiiite as simple as that. So Contra, not only are you part of my holy trinity of new favorite Leftist Youtubers (Bomberguy and Shaun being the other two and cameos between you all make me squeal), but videos like this help me to further understand a world that an increasing amount of people I know live in every day.
maybe offtopic, but some terf called me an "autoandrophile" when she found out im a trans dude  terfs are fuckin wild lmao
I've long had conflicting views on transgender; I've always respected people who were transgender, use the language that would make them most comfortable, but I never really knew where I stood on the concept of transgender itself.   Lately watching your videos, especially this video and you describing the details of your own transition, I think has largely changed my view on the subject. I truly appreciate your insights and videos!
You make me proud, you're saving lifes by debunking indoctrinated bullshit.
<3
Dear sweet ContraPoints, you are a breath of fresh air. Unlike you and your dawning of awareness, I did not have any support, in fact, I was nine and it was 1969 and soon learned that this would be my shameful secret for life.  I never saw myself as a homosexual which was confusing because if I wanted to be a girl doesn't that mean I am supposed to like guys and I have always liked girls. When I was younger there was some sexual excitement when I wore women's clothes but I think it was largely due to the fact that the women's clothes I was wearing were lingerie and sexy. And I can say that there always was a little excitement when I put women's clothes on, as in I would get wood, but it would not last, but that could be the excitement of the forbidden for it was a secret that no-one knew. Now that I no longer have the shameful secret and wear women's clothes constantly there is no such excitement. And when it comes to sex, even without hrt, my mindset is one that looks for that connection and I do not need an orgasm. And yes when I originally penetrated myself it was to feel that feeling of penetration, but dammit, I know it is not the same. Bums and pussies are two different things and I have never liked anally penetrating a woman and the idea of doing it to a man does not do anything for me.  Oh, by the way, can we keep this just between us? Thanks I knew you would understand. ;)
Fucking cockbane! Lol
My respect for Contrapoints- ⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️
Just wondering. In a previous video (why I'm genderqueer), you said that you like your masculine voice. However, it seems that you've decided to change it sometime between the video before this one and this. Would you mind explaining why?
This was really thought provoking and your   earnestness and openness is really valuable and meaningful.  Thanks for sharing your story and thoughts, and for such a FUCKING HIGH PRODUCTION VALUE CHRIST
Ways of Seeing should be required reading for everyone. Also your gorgeous lighting is not talked about enough
💖💖💖💖💖 As an intersexed ( true gonadal ) and transitioning female who was aware at age 5 , I wasn't a boy and obviously wasn't a girl either , I greatly appreciate that you chose to speak on this matter . I love your ability to observe the ...ahem...observer whilst maintaining perfect composure . I find that über hot for some reason 😏💦 .  I wish I could keep my composure but I'm still in trauma recovery for a lifetime of abuse , abandonment and other heavy stuff. I didn't begin HRT until age 49 , but I've been living openly trans for 6 years now .  After 2 years on HRT on July 13th , I have absolutely no regrets .
unce tice tree times a mady
ContraPoints you don't UNDERSTAND. Trans ppl are all garnet obviously.
God dam I love who you are :* XOXOXOXOX
I’m not a trans woman, but when I first heard of Blanchard’s theory, I felt physically ill with some combination of grief and rage. However, I am an asexual person, and even though academic recognition of asexuality is still in its relative infancy, I’ve already heard it said by a sexologist (one of the most prominent researchers of asexuality right now) that many asexuals may have automonosexualism.... that is, we’re asexual because we’re sexually attracted to ourselves. I don’t think the vitriol towards asexuality will ever be as bad as the vitriol directed at transwomen, but I know this early academic talk of many asexuals potentially being automonosexual “narcissistic” paraphiles is going to catch up with us once the general public becomes more aware of us.
I enjoyed your video I also wanted to point out that I'm a cis woman who always sleeps in a bra, and knows other cis women who sleep in a bra, so I hope you don't feel unfeminine for that.
This video was both enlightening to me as a trans man about the experiences and bigotry I don't go through that trans women do, and the experiences we share in common.
Thank you for sharing your transition story. Obviously, that was not the point of this video was, but, being real, a lot of it struck home with me, especially the part about aging causing dysphoria. Aging is the number one cause of my own dysphoria; I don't mind growing older (as I've become significantly more empathetic, smarter, and thoughtful as I've grown up), but the realization that I wont age into a woman like my mother (we look pretty similar), or even an androgynous person, made me realize I hated being a man, and that I wanted to transition. As such, I've been quasi-socially transitioned for about 3 years, and I'll hopefully be getting my first dose of HRT at the end of the week.
I'm twerking to that intro lololol
In the hopes of adding more to the discussion I'll say that I've read some studies that suggest that sexuality changes in degrees over a lifetime. An example being women who come out lesbian later in life after a long lasting hetero marriage. I can't help but be a bit tickled at how the same sort of arguments used against bisexual folks are used in the theory against Trans folks: sexual deviancy. Your very personal interview is both informative and moving, thank you. I have yet to watch the other video you mention but I feel much the same way about my "linebacker-esq" physique and aging as you describe in this video. However these days I find my self devoid of the energy I know I'd need to transition due to life factors and family. I have an amazing network of supportive people but my family by blood are both a drain and a source of turmoil in my life and due to their health issues I can't bring my self to simply part from their company, I cannot overcome loving them.  Also I'm pretty sure a theory that isn't falsifiable isn't a real scientific theory.
this is such a male-centric theory. its essentially based on the idea that if you don't want to be a man its either because you want a man to f*ck you or you want to f*ck the Ms Pacman of yourself. Like when it gets down to it, none of these theorists is able to comprehend someone not holding manhood as ideal. as a lesbian, maybe that bias is too obvious to me, as I neither want to be a man fucking a woman nor do I want to get fucked by a man.  actually, thats probably why there's no analagous theories about trans men. these researchers think (perhaps unconsciously) "of course you don't want to be a woman." The derrision the scietific community has for women, i swod to god
hi
https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/02/northwestern-university-p_n_830423.html this. fucksaw incident. is. HILARIOUS.
“Socrates, you know the drill,” or “Socrates: you know the drill” is such a perfect way to begin a segment that employs the Socratic method that I am genuinely surprised that I’ve never heard it before.  Although, I have to confess, I paused the video to write this comment immediately after hearing those 5 words. So I don’t actually know if the segment employs the Socratic method or if it references something specific he said. I hope it’s the former.
I found it very enlightening to learn that the female libido is a result of hormones. I always thought it was something societal.
Such a beautiful and intelligent being. Thank you for being and sharing you. Huge fan!
When you started playing the Time Warp I SCREECHED thanks for indulging the crazy theatre kids, Contra.
Patient 655321 coming up 4 years behind you. I seem to share many of your personal experiences, and I imagine they would have been more if our circumstances were more similar. I imagine I have a few unusual ones throwing things off, but who knows. The way you say you experienced things in your youth (e.g. fantasizing about women in a very abstract way) made me think it must be because you're just a smart person, that's how a smart person probably would experience it... because it seems to resonate with me, and people have been telling me I'm smart. although I'm not buying all of that. It made me wonder, if you have nothing better to do, if you would comment one way or another on how being smart factors into the experience of being transsexual. Personally, I've been confusing myself so much that I think I must just be faking it or something, and I'm still not done trying to figure it out. I have for some years now believed that transitioning is not really an option, because it could never undo the way you grew up, the more if you do it, say, in your mid twenties or later, when you're supposed to have done most of the "becoming a functional adult" or a "person" that good citizens are supposed to do...
Holy fuck. I laugh so hard at your videos and random filth dropping. Keep it up! They're also very insightful and informative.
(0:00) I am looking for Tiffany Tumbles.  This https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1dJ8whOM8E was the first video I have comes across that parody character. Personally I want to see more and hope there is more of her.  It might make up for me very intentionally not watching Blaire White just about probably approximately 2 years.
"I can make Greek words too!"
I think you're very  generous and brave. I hope you find exactly what you're looking for and silly amounts of happiness. *hugs* (if you want them)
I'm in love. Damn!
Im jealous you get to be on only 200 spiro. I have really high T naturally and I have to 400 to get my t down.
22:00 that part killed me.
So you are Trans? I've recently discovered your channel and I've been jumping across your timeline. It's a little confusing.
Autogynephilia is basically a way of, "slut shaming" of Trans women.
Really, really good job Contra. You are brave. <3
Really good, very thorough video.  Also, hats off to your set and light design, I could pause your videos at any point and do a color study.
...what happens when you watch this video with red-green 3d glasses
Why do you have to constantly make such great material??
The part wear she talks about sleeping in a bra helping her sleep really got me. This video is a master piece thank for sharing so much of your reality.
So. I'm REALLY REALLY REALLY attracted to you. Like a lot. But I'm cishet...? I don't know after all this fam. After watching your videos, I'm curiously and pleasantly confused. If that can be a thing. It's a lot. But yeah. You're very attractive and intelligent. So yeah. 🤷🏿‍♂️❤️  And you are so brave for expressing this and you're deepest feelings. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
38:05 big mood
Sometimes I sleep in a bra because I'm too lazy to take it off.
I'm very, very glad I spent 48 minutes listening to this video.
You are superb in sooo many ways. I love you!
This video is so beautiful.
"cisvestic autogynephile" lmao. every time i watch this video, i'm just in awe of your courage and honesty in terms of just...putting everything out there the way you do. as a cis woman, the best part of this video for me is your deconstruction of "normal female sexuality" and the vanity myth. particularly the segment stating that most trans women (in your experience) exhibit "normal female sexuality" which is why blanchard seeing it in people who he's wrongly assuming to be men makes it seem so weird. it really hits the nail on the head of this issue. even barring the concept that there is a such thing as "normal female sexuality", trans women are women in as much as cis women are.
30:11 Thanks for pronounceing it as Bachhh
You are very brave revealing such personal things
Actually, I came here for the science!  I love how beautifully nuanced, well researched, and perfect comedic punctuated your videos are, and so gorgeously shot and expertly edited to boot!  It's heartbreaking how people are so obsessed with simplifying the trans experience, ignoring evidence just because it doesn't fit their personal belief.  Thank you so much for your incredibly personal accounts as well, they really touched my heart.  I'm cheering for you and your bravery in transitioning and being so open to educating the public with your excellent  *snort* "everyone's born a fsking baby."  This is such a perfect line and excellent point!  Gender and sex are such complicated concepts, particularly as you add on the epigenetic, environmental physical factors, and cultural components; so many people don't fall into a discrete category even if they don't feel any dysphoria.  Not to mention the sheer number of people running the gamut of intersex conditions at birth and are forcably assigned a gender.  It's unfortunate that our basic educational system is so focused on the chromosonal component to physical sex to the exclusion of all other factors, especially some that are so simple - it's not just your genes, it's how you express them, or how you wear them :3.  We just don't know enough, and might never know enough, to determine what a person's gender identity will be, as there really is no discrete 'male brain' and 'female brain', instead two poles of an overlapping set of bell curves, and the extra unpredictable variation due to the brain's physical plasticity - not everyone's brains use exactly the same physical locations for the same things.  As cell and molecular biology was my main focus in university, I could go on an on on this subject ad infinitum.   Really, how can anyone think that a trans person would put themselves through the physical and financial hell of transitioning all for the purpose of masturbation or to sneak into a bathroom to rape people -  this just makes me sick.  Trans people are the ones who are constantly living in the fear of being raped by people who think it will teach them they're not trans, not to mention the rate at which trans people are murdered.  I know I've been threatened with rape repeatedly when people pick up on my not matching the binary despite not physically attempting to pass as male.   I know that my self-concept has changed dramatically throughout my life (and I'm only 34).  I know I tended to be male self-identifying as a child despite being assigned female at birth and I would still be very happy if I had transitioned when it still would have been convenient.  However I find myself feeling comfortable with being seen as a woman as well, especially when it comes to F**K YEAH, A GIRL DID THAT! and when I'm active in the political scene.  I tend to identify as gender fluid now as I find my identity impacted by my immediate surroundings (or by the people populating the area).  Sigh, why does it have to be so complicated.    So many people have never considered that one's assigned sex, gender identity, sexual attraction, romantic attraction, and persistent life partner(s) attraction are not innately linked and may not conform to a hetero/homo binary.  It's so scary to anyone who doesn't feel comfortable with the critical thinking required to try to understand.  The 'innate soul' does become extremely comfortable shorthand, especially for those who are anti-science.  I know I certainly had to couch terms in biblical comfortable ways when discussing evolution with the Christian conservative layman while working as an educator at a butterfly house in a major tourist site -- presenting it as the profane tools used by the define when shaping the clay into all of creation, describing the river as the milky way, the clay on the banks being a divine metaphor for the creation of elements needed to make everything else, that things were coached in metaphor for the benefit of early mankind before they could understand the beauty of the universe and just how infinitely beyond our meek mortal realm the infinite of the divine is (often by pointing out that metaphor is used all the time, they can see we're not literal sheep, so why should a day, or mud, or a river for God be so small as literal human-scale day, mud, river, etc.) -  I really got the feeling that I got through to people that way, showing them how the ancient universe and evolution did not invalidate their beliefs, and might instead reinforce them by show God to be even more powerful than they initially imagined.  Wow, I really got off on a tangent there.
bailey is Still employed at northwestern holy shit...brb as i warn friends i have going there about his bullshit
I LOVE YOU!
This is fucking great. I'd gladly becoming your friend and/or cuddle buddy. At least half of your personas turn me on and all of them fascinate me, and most of them make me wanna go into deep conversations where everyone keeps learning new stuff.
I love you. You are truly unique, intelligent, funny as hell, and just all around wonderful. Oh, and sexy ;-)
I have been binge watching your videos in a possibly unhealthy way. Fucking brilliant.  Topical and informatiive talks with fantastic costumes and the coolest lighting schemes since the death of Giallo films? Just. Fucking. Brilliant. Thank you.
I didn't even know TERFs still existed.  I thought they were just some weird 80s shit!  I looked up the phrase "TERF Reddit" and was proven wrong.
I can say that my experience as a born female is very similar to what you describe. I agree that these guys are attempting to understand female sexuality through a male lens. When seen from the female perspective, your experience makes total sense because it IS female as a female would experience this. I think what these men have demonstrated is simply how much they don't know about the female experience. I'm afraid the humiliation you've been subject to is also another female experience. Even born females aren't treated nicely when being open about female sexuality because it scares the shit out of men, and competitive other women. Namely because we readily form emotional and/or sexual bonds with almost anyone we choose and it may or may not include those who view themselves as powerful above all. We're more likely than men to get laid as often as we want; We rarely have to ask for permission to have sex. (This scares competitive women, too.) People are often more to us than sexual objects. These are huge threats to those, many times men, not having a full understanding of how relationships work because it places them at a disadvantage when it comes to sex and bonding in general. They sometimes hate us for it; I think that whenever we've been subject to abuse and criticism, this is why. We have more options for friendship, love, intimacy and sexual gratification. This is inherently female. It seems to me that the capacity for all these things is part of you, too. On another note, I call myself straight only because I prefer men over women. I don't think this is uncommon in either direction; Its just socially unacceptable for straight men to enjoy sex with other men. I think that's self discriminatory. I've often thought it would be interesting to know that if we couldn't know the gender of a person, how often would we chose one sex over the other as intimate partners. I think that as the LGBTQ communities share more of their experiences we’ll learn more about such things because we’ll have appropriate control groups. For instance, women tend to think objectification is something perpetrated exclusively on them when gay men also objectify one another. So we can understand objectification as having some functionality in male sexuality overall and not a bias against women.
15:12 best shit ever
fascinating video, thanks.
You're brilliant and you're on my "She-roes" list! Also, is it me, or are there monsters in your wallpaper?
Wow. Why do they put spiro in it? It is about potassium retentive diuretic.
sobscronched
"...a legitimate role for heartwarming gibberish in the discourse..." YES. This is the kind of complexity/diversity of thought that helps me trust your work. "The ability to hold two opposing ideas in the mind at the same time"...
Peter reading lewd and tokenly clinical is amazing.  I mean the whole video is, but that reading suprised the hell outta me.
I’m asexual (maybe homoromantic or aromantic WHO KNOWS) and Trans (probably a femby but yet again WHO KNOWS) so I found this video really interesting.  One I feel like people like me are another point that prove the theory of autogynaphile wrong.  Also as an asexual I find sexology in general interesting.  Also damn you have courage for talking about such personal stuff.  Anyways thanks for a great video on an important topic.
back when i was pretending to be a cis female i wore layered sports bras to bed because the compression that came with it stopped my ugly meat sacks from dragging and flapping around and waking me up
Hey Natalie, I just wanted to say thank you very much for sharing so much and making this video. I've been kind of internally all over the place with this gender stuff the past 6 years or so, and I related to a lot of your experiences and feelings. As you said, they were incredibly difficult and scary to talk about for yourself, and I think that's part of why I didn't really realize them explicitly in myself. So thank you for both offering that insight and putting those feelings into words. Thank you as well for talking frankly and realistically about a lot of these issues. For a while, I felt bad about not 100% buying into the "female essence" theory, especially considering I don't feel like a woman inside a man's body. And so I would assume whatever is going on is autogynephilia. It's nice to know that this whole thing is more complicated and wonderful than that, and I'm most likely not some freakish pervert trying to manipulate everyone around me. There is a lot of content in this video and I'll likely have to watch it multiple times, so sorry if I misrepresented anything you said in this comment. I just mainly wanted to say, you've made a person who feels weird about their gender, body, sexuality, and social presence feel a lot less alone and...valid. As overused as that word can be, ultimately, I think that's what a lot of us are looking for and so again, I wanted to thank you. There is a lot more that I feel like I'd like to say but I don't know how to articulate it well, so I'm going to stop here before I delete this whole mess.
You are a fucking dreamboat. Thank you for all this work.
i can't believe she locked her panty drawer :/ feminizing your partner is great, she doesn't know the kind of fun she's missing out on. sigh... why are cis women so boring
Julia Serano as a source for anything?! Crikey.
You're a genuinely amazing person contra, you know that?
As a cisman, I now wanna ahve sex like a walrus ... Not sure exactly how that is and a little afraid to dig too deeply into it, but I got big canines, that's almost the same as the tusks, and I've got about the same body construction
I'm a gay man and I found this video fascinating, especially the part where you so eloquently and honestly talk about your personal experience and perspective as a trans woman. What I found most interesting was that you said you did not believe in the feminine essence theory. I've always believed that trans people are those whose souls don't match the bodies they were born into so to hear an actual trans person say they don't believe this to be the case was illuminating for me. It showed me that, even with what I believed was my benign, accepting thoughts on trans people,  I was still generalising about their experiences. Truly every trans person's experience and perspective is unique.  I really enjoy your videos and am very glad you're finding happiness in your transition. I hope I don't sound too patronising when I say I think that your decision to live openly as a woman in your daily life is incredibly brave.  Keep up the good work!  P.S: You look very attractive as a woman. ;)
was that Nick Kroll doing the reading? I fucking love your channel, you seem a very fun person to be around and, sorry if it sounds creepy, but you are indeed a VERY sexy woman, and I was really sad when you said you didn't love yourself, i hope that you already have come to love. (again, sorry if i 'sound' creepy)
I’m glad I found your channel, cause I’m pretty sure that without you, I’d never know about this and I might have even wound up accidentally writing a trans character who falls into these mens’ lies.   Also..... Sex robot? Fucking what?!
I'm a bi cis guy and I have Autogynephilia. I didn't have it until you brought it up, but yeah. Pretty hot.
I don't think anyone would call Bailey's book science though the word science is in the title. It seeks to use anecdotes and is certainly a biased text... but despite its popularity I find it unreasonable to use in any sort of scholarly fashion except as an example for an early practice in applying critical methods. Any sort of use of this as material of this quality as scholarly would be disastrous, but from a cursory glance it doesn't appear to sell itself as anything more as pop psychology. However it seems as though he properly identified his biases from the passages shown here. Of course influencing pop psychology is not consequence free particulary for transwomen in this case it doesn't appear either Bailey nor Blanchard are worthy of contempt. I doubt any negative consequences were foreseeable. I wouldn't worry about popularizing it in any fashion, ideas were meant to be debated and refuted. As long as you aren't beating a long dead horse it's unlikely you'll cause harm.
I can't believe all this bullshit as Autogynephilia exist when the studies in Neuroscience about the impact of prenatal testosterone in the development on the brain, which are overwhelming, and which totally legitimize the transgender issue, in the fact that what transgender women experience as gender dysphoria and their totally natural tendency to behave and experience life and society as average women, is real, it must be real also according to science, due to the fact that the levels of prenatal testosterone vary in between born "males" or foetuses. And as Nathaly explains it very well; The last issue is testosterone in the blood... which has an impact also on the behaviour.  The neuroscientific researches about prenatal testosterone make transgenderism very easy to understand. In the case of transgender women is male bodies born with very feminine brains (which developed in a very ow prenatal testosterone environment)  that when they arrive at the puberty experience a bust of testosterone due to the testicles they have, and as soon as you block the testosterone you have a behavioural woman totally compleat. Transgender women are neurobiologically women and science is already there just take a look at the studies about prenatal testosterone and all is there. I hope is clear English is my 3 dr langue sorry
God I loathe Opera music. I know I should have more profound thoughts... but I don't.
A lot of lesbians are just so butch, they get by as men, and mistakenly believe they are men until way later.
binging ContraPoints and ketamine 10/10
Can we be friends?
arguments about how people transition to become more socially accepted get me every fuggin time lmao
I sure hope you're joking about all the drinking in your videos. You know that doesn't turn out well... I mean beyond the metaphor of... "Baliey's".  1.) By the way... HOW does this guy Baily get to pass himself off as a "cis-straight man"?? If he was so "straight" ... he would not be so fascinated by gays and transsexuals. So why aren't you calling him out of his closet?   2.) WHY ... why do Transwomen play into the binary boxes of being either a "man" or "woman"?? Historically transgender people have not only been the Shamans, two-spirits, and healers ... but the artist and ... well.. artist and musicians (etc..) ARE the healers who are ahead of the numbed out center.  I think Transwomen / Transmen are selling themselves out. I'm glad you'll see how your sexuality will continue to ebb and flow and grow.  3.) ... and WHY are you calling Michael Baily a "straight man"? Any guy who makes a habit of going to Tranny Bars every week ... is NOT "straight" ... perhaps.. "Str8" ... or in truth, Bisexual.
I love this video, but even as a joke, using 50 Shades of Grey as an exemplary of female sexuality is filling me with dismay D:
Leeeeets do the time waaaaarp again !
For the record, I do have a cis woman friend who wears a bra to sleep (or at least did as a young teen, idk if she still does. We haven't had a sleepover in a while)
You didn't have to do this. The argument implodes as soon as srs or HRT is started. Trans women report loss in sex drive and yet still wish to be transgender.  I made this comment at the start of the video. Well done.  Edited twice to say omg   I'm a fan now hahahaha
Waiting for that mind-body video...  Also, you are doing a wonderful job refuting all those BS theories of people who love their intelectual-posturing too much but have very little substance to back it up (is there a greek word for it?).  Also became a contributer a few days ago. Someone need to say those things and I'm too lazy and not talented enough to do it myself.
Damn your videos are fucking amazing!! You are the best! Sexuality and gender/identity gets so complicated when you go further than straight men's simple impulsive jerking off when stimulated visually ;)
You are awesome Natalie!!
Thank you for taking the time to go into depth on all this shit
As I watched this video, I felt the guy-to-guy camaraderie I felt towards you based on previous videos shrivel up and die, and my subconscious/implicit misogyny kick in to replace it. I already find you less funny, and for some reason I feel like you're now being paid too much for the work you do. So like, for better or worse, even my bigot asshole subconscious considers you a woman.
Love the lighting in all of your videos, it’s really pretty
im a trans man but talking about the history of autogynephilia and its details actually has helped alleviate some doubts ive had since i came out. that i might have just convinced myself im trans and the implication of feelings i had in early puberty towards men that whats his name would have attributed to autoandrophilia had he bother to think about trans men. so i wanted to say thank you. seriously. thank you so so much.
I agree that Blanchard's research is crap, but Moser's research is crap as well - it wasn't a like for like comparison using the same or even similar questions, they were entirely different to the point we really can't make any real comparison between the two other than the researchers both used the same Greek-ish terms and seem to enjoy defining others' sexuality.
Very brave, brilliant and so very funny. Well done.
Hey I found your channel pretty recently, and it's teaching me a lot. I've always been pretty liberal and have made efforts to be accepting and understanding of oppressed/disadvantaged minorities. However, I grew up in a military family, then moved to the south and attended public schools, and as one can imagine neither setting was overly kind to trans individuals. As such, that part of my social education has always been lacking, and I'm really glad I found this channel to kind of guide me into the knowledge that I need for interacting with the trans community before I made too many major blunders. I'm sure comments like these are all over the page, and the video is kind of old anyways, but I wanted to say thanks for the content
Ever drink Baileys from a shoe?
Cluster Queen Bee
Excellent, honest, and incisive dissection of a particularly nasty, sordid, and damaging theory (The hubby and I were both highly amused at your reading of Bailey as bad pop-science meets bad porn).
30:24 That's a new take on Groucho Marx.   Seriously though, you're a star.  You've a real gift for mixing pop culture and academic theory with original wit and an all-too-absent healthy dose of empathy, kindness, self-doubt, and imagination that combine to form something unique and compelling and uniquely compelling.
I know a trans girl who transitioned 100% because she wanted the thrill of cross-dressing all the time. now she's not sure if she wants to be a women. trans is trans. CD is fetish or egg trying to crack
we're basically twins
PREACHHHHHHHH
as a quiet Minnesotan man, it makes me so incredibly uncomfortable to listen to someone recant their entire history of sexual dynamics straight into the camera lol.  i get what you're doing, but i feel so bad.  people should be allowed to their privacy
The historic present makes me glad I've never read Fifty Shades of Grey.
you are a very unattractive man
I was talking to a trans friend, and she behaves very like a gay man in terms of attraction. But if hormones can make you feel more like the sex they're generally associated with, why not just take male hormones and feel more comfortable in your own gender? I know I feel a lot more comfortable in my skin after sex, the gym, nofap, etc. Has this ever been tried?
There needs to be a change.org petition to find someone to pour milk on Contra's tits and fuck her (with her consent of course). Forced celibacy is hell #FreeTheContra
“Don’t let us forget that the causes of human actions are usually immeasurably more complex and varied than our subsequent explanations of them.”   - Fyodor Dostoyevsky
"But I fundamentally resonate with the wish to be wanted. I want other people to think I'm sexy and want to fuck me, you know. It makes me feel like I have value and it fills up the void inside."  That is some low self esteem bullshit. You have value regardless of whether or not people want to fuck you. Also, this entire video is the biggest pile of bs I have ever seen. I am a straight, cis guy. I have at times imagined myself as a woman fucking a man. It's heterosexual intercourse, just the camera angle is different. Also, I have in some way shape or form been attracted to myself. That stuff is totally normal.

Just commenting for the algorithm.
I love your channel so much. I think it's really important that you did make this video because it's the first thing that comes up when you search Autogynephilia on YouTube instead of some hateful misinformation. Also from an aesthetic perspective it's been so cool to watch your makeup skills develop and I think your commentary on female sexuality via 50 shades at the end is spot on! Please keep the videos coming ❤️
Cisgender pansexual woman here. Some TMI kink talk ahead.  I have often fantasized about transforming into another gender or having a penis while masturbating. This TF kink (mtf or ftm) seems to me to be more represented by cisgender men and trans women online (on places like Deviantart), but I'm sure that many cis women like me have this too because many enjoy pegging (not equating pegging with this kink but it may be one explanation for some people).  It's interesting how you explain the differences and similarities between trans people and cis people in this respect.  I've often thought, hmmm... it's strange that I like the idea of having a penis sometimes, but I don't suffer from gender dysphoria and feel very comfortable identifying as a woman.  Now I can put words to why, for trans men or trans women, the feeling of embodying a certain gender extends far beyond sexual fantasies.  It's also helpful to know that many of us, cis and trans, experience these kinds of sexual thoughts and that they are completely normal.  That's why it seems like a good idea to me that gender, like sexuality, exists on a spectrum and sometimes we are rounding up to a particular label that best suits our interactions with the world.  Disclaimer: I'm no expert on gender studies.  These are things I've only been able to start thinking about recently due to many of the conversations started by trans people around gender identity.  All I know is that we are happiest when we live our most authentic selves without internal shame. (A hard thing, I know. If only society could make it easier for everyone to do this.)
I'm as cishet as it gets, and I'm really glad you made this vid. I've always been an ally, but this helps me put myself in your shoes even more, and helps me understand the more nuanced challenges trans people face every day.   Your channel is my new favorite rabbit hole in so many ways. I got here while looking into Jordan Peterson (thought he was a hack from the first moment I saw him). You articulate so well so many of the things I'm feeling politically, and your self-examination is a huge inspiration. The transgender education I'm getting is icing on the cake. It'll definitely help me discuss pro-trans positions with my cis friends who have a hard time understanding it.  Love what you do. Keep it up. The world will be a better place when it realizes humans with such color and variety are normal.
Every time I hear terms like "dating marketplace" I throw up a little bit.
I've dressed in the past, I present very masculine, and can confirm that a loooooot of seemingly normal women love feminising men. You'd be surprised. Our paths are almost similar, but after a period of intense gender dysphoria I decided to be a man. I think there was a lot of negative impulses in my wanting to be feminine: I wanted people to find me attractive, I wanted to shirk the responsibilities of being a man. I do some minor dressing now (painted toenails, underwear, that kinda thing), and it can be sexual but it mostly isn't. Other than that I'm a man through and through, and I feel happy, confident, just good. You've picked your path Natalie, maybe it's right for you and I hope it is, but I think it's very important to tell people going through dysphoria that you might not need to deal with the emotional distress of transitioning, and you might just be able to make the grass on your side greener
It must have been very hard to talk about something like this so thoroughly at this point in your transition. We disagree on almost every contemporary issue, but I respect you a lot
Correlation clusters that get fuzzy around the middle? You're starting to sound like Charles Murray
You're so beautiful and intelligent and funny??? Oh my god????
i know it's probably all been said but you are a hero and an inspiration. i love your channel
This is profoundly late and probably unhelpful, but as a cis woman, I sleep in a bra quite often. Sometimes just too lazy to take it off I guess.
I am in love with you. You're amazing <3
Are you a trans woman? I thought you said you were like gender fluid or something
That was a sick remix of Prokofiev.
Nature can change, culture can change, but the semiotic field is almost completely immutable.    As symbols, masculine and feminine are precisely the same they always were, which is why all  other non-binary genders are perceived, symbolically, as mere variations of the female gender (in the sense that they all revolve around "complacency" which is the main sign of femininity), with no relation to the semiotics of masculinity (which revolves around the "non-failure" principle, "the exigence" principle).   All these ideas were put forward by Baudrillard in "Consumer Society" on his chapter about male and female models, in case anyone cares.   So in this sense, and I think Judith Butlers ideas would also end up confirming this, there is only one single signifier of gender difference. You are either a male, or a non-male. And even if you are a female, you are symbolically a male if you don't match the complacency model and instead go for the "self-demanding" non-failure model.   Great video as usual
Why can't all trans people be as calm; rational, and open about their experiences as you?
Contra you fuckin need a show on Netflix or something .. insightful , educational , funny as fuck, charming ,on point , i mean you got it all . If i wasn't such a broke loser from Scotland i'd be a patreon . I do spread the word tho . basically im a massive fan if that wasn't clear.
Abigail needs Jesus
Sex robots? WHERE DO I GET ONE ASAP (Only if they can consent)!!!!
i know plenty of cis women who wear bras to sleep. strangely masochistic, but common.
At some point I started to get a little mad, then you said the thing I had in my head as a counterpoint.  Rock on!
the music u use between the sections sounds like the music used in good eats with alton brown
Cis woman who regularly sleeps in a bar over here.
Hi there! I just discovered your channel. As a physics student and science lover AND a feminist with a lot of doubts about gender theories and my own sexuality, I really want to thank you for doing this video. It helped me so much to (try) better understand the transwoman experience. I looooved the humorous and kinda academic/scientific tone of the video (the physicist in me just gagged with the structure of the narrative). Kisses! :*
Me, an asexual, homoromantic, non-op trans lesbian:  *thonk*
This video was great.  It's pretty amazing that you were willing to share such intimate and, frankly, deep parts of yourself with us all. We need to come up with some sjw medals of honour or something so you can have one 👍   While I know other people telling you that you don't need to worry about finding someone who'll love you as you is pretty ineffectual at achieving anything, I'm still going to express that sentiment. And as a creepy bonus (since this is the internet after all) I'd like to point out that I found you attractive before you started transitioning but were 'cross dressing' and I very much do now too. So there you go, at least one weirdo on the internet thinks you're pretty!  I am slightly disappointed by the 'filth' though I must say... I was expecting more fruit and vegetables being inserted all over the place and perhaps a reveal of a secret, roboticised-mannequin  sex dungeon. Need to work on that.
I just watched one of your old videos where you said "I'm not trans, I'm just an old fashioned cross dressing pervert"
I don't really agree with your politics but thought I'd leave a comment just to say I think you've blossomed into a beautiful young woman.
Thank you for making what felt weird feel more normal
<3 Amazing video. Also your piano playing is beautiful plz do more
DONT 👏 KINKSHAME 👏 AUTOGYNEPHILES 👏
Don't worry Contra, somewhere down the line of your transition, you should feel the Walrus start to come out when you're engaged in intimate acts. Then, and only then, will you truly understand a CIS woman's sexuality as we have for centuries.  PS. Goddamn girl, you lookin' fiiiine. <3
1) Brilliant content. I've heard of this idea before but never really understood it. I'm glad I'm not the only one who, while fully willing to affirm trans identities, feels there's something off about the idea that we are these gendered disembodied souls assigned or misassigned to bodies which we either accept or disavow. 2) I suppose none of us are guaranteed love and happiness, but I sure hope it finds you.
Why are almost all autogynphelia white males and almost all of the white transwomen are "lesbians" but the oppossite is true for transwomen of color? I have noticed this
32:10 holy shit this makes so much sense!
Just started checking out your channel and was already loving it, but with this video you are my hero. Thanks for being so frank and breaking down this topic! (TMI but) A few years ago I used to joke that I was autoandrophiliac, because I liked to imagine I was a cis man and sometimes did so while jerkin it. (Stopped making that joke when I realised there was trans erasure involved in that concept. Whoops.) Now I'm semi-out as nonbinary and trending male, so joke's on me I guess. Anyway uh this oversharing is just to say that this video meant a lot, and that it's weirdly reassuring to know that that kind of thing isn't abnormal.  Also your videos are hilarious and I love your goth wallpaper.
Cis hetero male here. In order to empathize and understand transgender, i have had some questions that I knew would have to wait for when I created a close relationship with a trans person in order to ask.  Because those questions would almost be asking them to validate themselves to me.  This video definitely answered some of those questions and highlighted how even the framing of my thinking was askew.  I had never even heard of autogynephilia, but had definitely prescribed or heard the perspective through more colloquial terminology and I had very little personal contextual understanding outside of the 'folk lore'.  But, I think the insights that you shared that are even more helpful was your ability to describe a female sexuality through the eyes of male sexuality because you had one and transitioned to the other.  So even though my wife and I have deep conversations about these things, as well as other people, you were able to dispel certain male projections that I wasn't aware I was using.  Thank you so much for sharing and making this vid.
Contrapoint, thank you for this video. I'm grateful for your work, courage and as always the creativity. I feel your balance and honesty aids viewers to move beyond curiosity and towards reflection and empathy. You've given me lots to think about. Thank you again
Lol. When the theory is proven wrong, just slap more Greek terms on it until people give up even listening.  Hey, I like my BO. And I don't take dick pics. But I occationally get turned on after I happen to touch it non-sexually. Does that make me gay?? ;-)
so I'd been avoiding this video for a while due to the idea being kinda triggering (for obvious reasons as a transfem nb) but then I watched it and it was fucking great and has also told me so much info on hormone transitioning (all the behavioral, sex drive stuff) that I didn't realise and made me quite convinced that that's what I want. Also, the candid stuff about your own experience to get where you are and transition stuff was like some of the most empowering, inspiring stuff I've seen, thanks so much.
50% of chicks who bang mythbusters want to have walrus sex
Would ya fuck me I'd *NOT* fuck me
'Love for oneself as a woman', featuring Peter Coffin.  Well that's unfortunate.
Never knew of this theory so since it's bullshit, nice to be introduced it with an actual analysis of it.
Awww girl, as a hetero cis man you're passing, and you're adorable <3
I like my own body odure... but I'm a giant weirdo...
I love the genuine smiles Contra! Keep it up. ;)
14:10 what is I'm here for science and filth?
This video made me feel... not cis.
love the remixed Prokofiev
Sexuality has been a topic that I have not understood, and I am person who prefers to be patient and observe before I act. I thank you for clearing up a few perspectives I have yet considered.
I always wondered what cishet meant and then I realized ... cisgender + heterosexual.  Oh no I'm retarded.
as a genderqueer amab person in academia in the humanities (and also an alcoholic lol) who has been struggling with dysphoria a lot lately and has often thought of their genderqueerness as more of a compromise-position because of my own fear of transitioning, and being up all night having my weekly "should i transition" crisis before stumbling across your channel (through metafilter, so quite separate from my crisis), this video was sort of just... everything just hit so close to home, or rather this uncanny/unheimlich feeling of being at home or i mean where my head has been at, it's hard to articulate how much you articulated what i have struggled to articulate. oozing with gratitude, thank you so much for this video <3
Also can we talk about mobs on the web. I wonder if the problem is exacerbated by it being difficult to identify when you're a part of one. I know I have been guilty of participating in at least one.   I hate mobs though with a burning passion. I would never be part of one IRL.   That conflict makes me wonder if my idea has something to it.
Idk at risk of sounding like a slut for posting this to the comments, I haven't found that my paraphilias have gone away on HRT. (Maybe we're using different definitions of the word. It seems pretty ill defined with many similar terms muddying the waters) They've changed. I like different things than I did before definitely, and none of them can be counted as disorders anymore. But they haven't up and vanished. I am probably more into kink and the subculture than I was before I transitioned. Idk. That part of the video just didn't work for me. It felt like the way it was presented, that this was atypical female sexual expression. Which I suppose it is technically? Maybe it works better to say it felt like it was inadvertently cast in the light of invalidating female sexual expression. And I don't think it is that. There are cis women in kink.   For the rest of the stuff, I noticed similar changes to a greater or lesser extent. Like I still feel somewhat visually attracted but it's definitely much much less important, and some of my favorite stuff I've seen recently has been like art where there's good eye contact. My sex drive is waayyy different. Very similar to how you described it.  Idk. Just some stream of consciousness stuff from my first watch of the video. While we're still on the subject though, I wanted to post that I do think socialization in formative years around the subject is going to be different for trans vs cis women in our culture. And I think that's okay. I don't think it invalidates us.  Edit: "...vague bisexual interest activated by interpersonal connection rather than object oriented male lust." Woah. That describes it really well. I'm impressed by your cogency around this stuff. I just kinda word vomit until people understand what I mean lol.
I normally don't make comments on youtube videos, just as a general rule. I've been enjoying your content ever since I was first linked to you, for the surreal, for the informative, for the "fuck you figure it out", for your thoughts and input and personal insight.  This video was a very vulnerable sort of video to make, and for the kind of vulnerability you show here, you deserve to hear how well received it was, even just from one viewer at a time. I want to thank you and reassure you for the risk that you took in saying the things you say here, but I realize that also runs the risk of sounding condescending, especially from a stranger.  No one should have to disclose what you do here. This sort of thing is what is demanded of anyone who doesn't fit a pre-determined box every time; talk about your sexuality, talk about your life experiences, justify to others how you feel and WHY you feel and HOW DARE YOU feel, etc. And that's so invasive. I get a tight feeling in my chest thinking of that invasive interrogation. As if for having an opinion, you and your lived experiences are put on trial.  I'm sorry that you have faced this. I'm unimaginably proud of you for being brave-- not in a "everyone should be so brave!" sense, but dear lord the kind of resolve it takes to talk about this in such explicit and personal detail in a public forum. While it may not be much, and while it might get drowned out in this comment section, I want to wish you all the happiness in the world. You deserve no less than your own happiness.
This tears it. We need to get Natalie a robot. A sexy, sexy robot that can pour drinks and do the laundry.
I’m so glad I found your videos now I can sit around and watch YouTube and feel like it’s making me smarter
I enjoy my own BO ...
I thought his name was HENRY S. Plinkett! ｍｙｌｉｆｅｉｓａｌｉｅ
I just discovered you, you are adorable, brilliant, funny. More please!
very minute thing and i don't even know why i'm freely stating this because it has little to nothing to do with the video but i, a person w/ breasts, have slept with bras waaay often due to a deep self consciousness about my chest. that said, i've always had the...weirdest, most complicated feelings regarding gender and have gone back and forth uncomfortably for...years? (yikes) at this point, chest-binding and short hair and trying to make my appearance as masculine as a 5'2" feminine body with fairly feminine facial features would allow. anyways, bodies are weird, i guess.
Thank you 🙏 I love hearing your perspective.
So what about asexual trans women?
Brave and enlightening. I admire you immensely on many levels.
wow! amazing video. ive never seen these ideas discussed in exactly this way and it really changed my thinking about human sexuality
I came here to hear about science
I found your point about academic theories of transsexuality/transgenderism interesting. Of course it seems pretty ludicrous that any academic would take seriously a theory that involves assuming large sections of the people you're trying to describe are lying.   I tend to describe my own experiences of gender dysphoria (as a trans man) as my mental body map being that of a male body, basically that my brain thinks my body is male and, pre-transition, freaked out that it wasn't. Like, before I had my chest op it always felt like my boobs had just appeared out of nowhere, and as soon as they were gone it felt really weird to think they were ever there. I know not everyone experiences gender dysphoria in the same way, but I know some neuroscientists have started to find that trans people have differences in the part of their brain related to how we see ourselves, so it wouldn't surprise me if it turned out this was the case.
This is a great video, well done! My thought on autoogynephillia (as a trans man) is that it should be entirely unsurprising that someone who experiences gender dysphoria would struggle to feel sexual as their assigned gender, and so would fantasise about being their actual gender (or the associated sex) to get off
This was ssooooooo good.
Thank you so much for telling your story, in many ways, I could've told mine and it sound verbatim. People like Blanchard and Peterson are rife with simplistic thinking and malignant stereotypes. I could dismiss their thinking more easily if I hadn't been confronted by people who espoused their line of thinking. Thanks for your channel, and keep up the good work as always.
My fav. of your videos.
Don't worry I sleep with a bra ^_^
imagine clicking dislike on this video  put yourself in that headspace  lmao  just lmao
"I was born a fucking baby" SAME! I love your explanation of being trans because I feel very similar about my gender as a trans guy. (ignore the fact my name is feminine. I'm closeted.)
I'm a bit late, but I would like to thank you for this video. I had heard of the theory in passing and didn't think about it very much, and I'm glad to have a well thought out and researched explanation of its faults.
Im not sure that female heterosexuals are all about being desired and gay men are all about desiring. As a gay man a huge part of my sexuality is wanting to be desired as a man by other men. I like being thought beautiful or even lusted after. I’m not sure I completely buy some of the things you propose as differences between female heterosexuality and male homoeroticism tho I do think they are general different.
"would you fuck me, I wouldn't" aw that sucks
Your light setup during section 7 : autophilia in general is amazing.
its all genderism. That is, the gender version of sexism. Euro-western culture is entirely too androcentric and is out right sexist, that is, they were until they were cool with trans guys. Now they're genderist. Anything female is bashed against and female gender people are seen as sex objects and nothing more. This is our problem and is the real reason why they hate trans women and effeminate males.
Thank you so much. You are amazing.
Gurl, a man who would want to whistle at you has the highest kind of discernment. The man who does is the, and I'm going scientific on this, fucktard.
That one comment about the whistling reminded me of something my dad once said... "I would never join a club that would have me as a member."
Good god no I'm a cis woman and I don't often have sexy thoughts looking at myself. I pick at my flaws and resign myself to being some kind of monster. Then I CBT myself into realising I'm insane and I move on with life. Apparently many men (average looking ones at that) do admire themselves and tell themselves they're sexy on the daily.
Ajsjfjfjgjgkfkf lots of hugs! You are appreciated and these videos are definitely useful and interesting. Keep going on 💪💪💪💪
Massive fan of this vid. Quality work and cheers for the info.
Im a contragynephillac lol
I don't believe there has to be a sexual component. Both because asexual trans people exist and because children transition who have yet began puberty.
This video's honesty! That trial at the end! Your mind and ability to banter/explain points is a gift to the world.
It seems Blanchard's and his theories are very agnotologic, in the way he creates false dichotomies and pseudo-science to validate his opinion. It feels very reminiscent of Frederick Seitz using their position to further political goals as you said, and i find it great that you refuted it as thourouthly. You're an all around greattt gallll
Gosh you inspire me to do things. Thank you for being who you are Natalie!
The DSM V identifies autogynephilia under transvestism not gender dysphoria.... please read more
Damage???  or statistical evidence...  you can't have it both ways
it's scientific because it is the only empirical evidence actually produced... you are still a man... sorry
you are man sorry... please read Men Trapped in Mens Bodies....
See where it says 'sex: M' on the top right during that therapy session. I'm curious to know if that was intentional, because I know that your pronouns are she/her. Or is there something else that I'm not getting?
You are quickly becoming my favorite person on youtube. This channel has been such a positive effect on my transition.
Congratulation you made me google fucksaw.
you should consider writing up your stuff at 25:00 for Harper's. Great expression!
great analysis and explanations esp. after 15:00
I just discovered you from your Peterson video and I already adore you.
I'm pretty sure the biggest point blanchard is ignoring is that it's probably a lot easier to notice you identify as a woman if you like men exclusively.
I don't know why but I always come back to this video as my favourite Contrapoints video.  Maybe it's the fact that as a 50 minute argument on a small scope issue (compared to other Contra videos), it feels substantially more thorough and unambiguously a satisfying dunk on what is clearly some pretty garbage opinions masquerading as science.  Maybe it's the long very personal interview moment in the middle (which Contra establishes many many times as being something that people wish they could avoid in public discourse because of how personal it becomes) which is how I wish dicourse around gender would more frequently resemble, with people finding themselves in a space where such thorough personal descriptions of how they feel can be shared without fear of harassment, misrepresentation, or other dehumanising responses. Anyway, thank you so much for making this <3
As a woman who once fell asleep wearing a bra I highly recommend that you don't do that anymore. It can really fuck up your spine and rips. Once I woke up and was straight up paralysed for an entire day and was in pain for days to come. Just concerned for your spine
Aren't we all just one step away from building a sex robot
Regarding cis female/male sexual orientation, the basics are covered by the same gland (if it receives testosterone during development it gives attraction to women, else it gives attraction to men, regardless of the rest of the body) but the deeper implications (visual cues, appreciation of social success, dominance/submissiveness) are most likely related to various different areas of the brain with different timings of development.  Sexual identity is most likely also determined by the influx in hormones to a specific part of the brain during development, so obviously all sexually dimorphic characters tend to go together, but sometimes they don't, hence cishomo people and trans-formerly-hetero people.
Baby is a gender identity.  The genderless gender identity.  They don't get their own restroom though; they have to share the women's restroom.  Babies grow into their gender identity, identifying with it more and more as they approach and enter puberty, which is to say little boys and little girls don't fully identify as male or female yet; that's why you see tomboys and girly boys even among future heterosexual cis-men and women.   As a little girl I identified as rather gender-neutral, and a mix of boyishness and girlishness (that was the reason why I decided that purple was my favorite color, because it's a mix of pink and blue) and because my twin sister was the pink-loving girly-girl, I felt like I had to be the boy, or to be somewhat boyish anyway.  I didn't think that I looked like a "proper girl" for some reason, but I definitely didn't identify as a boy; I was always too physically inept for sports, got brainwashed easily by doll commercials despite hardly ever playing with them, and I wouldn't play video games at first because I had decided that they were "for boys" (didn't stop me from liking Power Rangers though).  I became more feminine as I got older, but I don't think my gender identity ever grew past puberty, seeing that I'm asexual and oblivious to female social pressures (I am also autistic).  So my femininity is the fluid, demi-agendered, asexual, sometimes tomboyish femininity of a prepubescent (if intellectually precocious) little girl, rather than the sexualised, motherly femininity of an adult woman.  I like wearing girly clothes because they look good on me and I wasn't allowed to wear dresses or long socks as a teen, however I don't like having huge breasts.  I often wear a breast binder, and I wouldn't hesitate to have them cut off were I not afraid of going under the knife for any kind of surgery ever.
Should we not let lesbian women or pre-op gynephilic trans men into women's restrooms since they are creepy sex perverts who want to spy on other women?  Come to think of it why does nobody want gays or lesbians to have a separate restroom?  In some cultures they are considered a third and fourth gender.
For a moment I thought you'd build the sex robot. EDIT: I can't believe I watched the whole video.
So, would you say that being a women lets you think more clearly? as in my experience, needing to masturbate as a male causes a severe feeling of mind-cloudiness. Although i can dismiss the urge if i distract myself with books or video-games or video-essays.
its interesting that it took going to college to realize that professors are just as fallible as normal fucks.
24:10 Omg! You lit this almost identically to the Mouth Moods cover art by Neil Cicierega! I love it!
This is actually my favorite video on the internet.
Great video with lots of new perspectives! I'd just like to add one thing: you pointed out that your description of cis female sexuality was not always true, which, like, duh. I'd like to add that I think the reason women aren't generally attracted to men in that way is that society does not allow men to be sexy. Men are dirty and gross, women are pure and attractive. I've even had men in my family joking about how "no woman wants to see your dick", which I find terrifying. I mean, I sure as hell wouldn't be dating my girlfriend if she didn't find me attractive.
I'm a straight dude I totally have looked in the mirror and said "I would fuck me, I would fuck me hard".  Well not recently I been drinking too much beer.
14:00 I came here for science =\
Don't compare these idiots to daddy Peterson
do not like the implications that dogs don't go to heaven... that's the only point i take issue with tho
Thank you for the insights. It helped me understand trans people a lot more.
I was waiting for Peterson to appear. I am so tired of his face.
0:35 lol you believe that people have souls :P
DAMN this must have been hard to make, but DAMN as myself a genderqueer person who's figuring their shit out, it was sooo helpful to hear about your life. Thank you
"someone.... please fuck me" same
As a cis female, it has always angered me how guys cannot *fathom* that anyone could have a significantly different sexuality than them. If they cannot imagine or understand how cis female brains (in all their variety) work, then do not comment on it. We are not the "tuned down version" of cis male sexuality. Transitioning is interesting mostly due to how it changes your brain, and lets you see into our world, and become one with it. :)
I would never be a part of any club that would have me as a member!
You sound much happier and free after transision, im so happy for you :)
"It's like admitting you like the scent of your own body odor."  Contra, don't kinkshame me. XP
34:46 The cover was decided by publisher (springer). Mos of their 'academic' books have the same look/cover. I know this because I am a nerd.
Im a cis gender man and I love flexing my muscles in the mirror . So what? You mean thats not normal?
I teared up when you reprised Time Warp at the end. What a beautiful end to the video.
Like where do AFAB people even fit into the mix? Like is just penis envy or I just a self loathing lesbian whose father did not love them enough?
Let's give a quick shoutout to my guy a bowl or creamy tomato soup
abigail what are you holding
I really like you, subscribed!  Looking forward to more :)
30:51 That's a pirate hunter, not a pirate
I really disliked this video at first. As an AGP male with no intention of transitioning I found this to be incredibly... infuriating I guess. About 10 minutes in I felt like punching something as it all just seemed like complete bullshit, and for it to go on for another 40 minutes well Christ I thought I was gonna explode.  It felt like you were doing the classic insecurity defense mechanism that I see from a lot of people. I thought everyone didn't understand what trans people were thinking, but I guess I also didn't understand what trans people were thinking. The "theory", whatever you wanna call it, of AGP completely and utterly described me and I felt like well everyone else must be the same then.   The way you discuss things towards the end of the video was pretty eye opening though and you made some genuinely really good points. In the same vein thought I feel like a lot of trans people (and others) who claim not to be AGP (doesn't matter if they are or aren't) make the exactly the same assumption as I did. "I am not AGP therefor no trans person is". All I can say about that is I am 100% a behavioral AGP with no interest in generic attraction to girls or guys and I do not want to transition, however Gender Dysphoria has not been easy for me. I spent a long period of my life completely confused, thinking I was trans, thinking I should be a girl. I saw someone to help me with it briefly, but they just told me more of the "girl trapped in a mans body" nonsense which I knew deep down just wasn't true. I assumed most transgender people experienced what I did but were not strong enough to be honest, I still don't know for certain but I hope that I am right in trusting people like ContraPoints on this, it would mean a lot to me if people were just honest about this.
youtube, there's a glitch with this video where i can only like it once, pls fix :<
Your hair is totally on point this video, omfg. I guess it'd be too much to ask for you to do a style/aesthetic video...
26:59 so what does it mean if i'm AFAB, never been on testosterone and completely fit the male sexuality profile (except androphilic Kinsey 1 instead of gynephilic)?
The perfect youtuber doesn't exi....
👏👏👏 bravo
I think the difference between your Cluster A and Cluster B definitions might simply be in the degree of dysphoria they experience. Trans people who experience more intense, persistent dysphoria would be motivated to act in ways that correspond to the gender they identify with earlier in life and transition as soon as the option becomes available to them, while trans people who experience low levels of dysphoria (at least initially) would generally just go along with their assigned social role until they realize what the source of their dissatisfaction with life is.
Maybe some of your videos I should not watch at work.
So then if you're not getting fucked then you are fucked, lol. Irony aside, great vid.
That slowed down "trans activists" bit makes me think you would do a pretty good SHODAN.
Fuck, I'm a trans person who's just come across this channel. Um, how to put this. Sex and dysphoria is not something that gets talked about a lot, not to me anyway. Your video, Part 6 especially has put so many of my deepest insecurities about transitioning and my motivations therein at ease, I feel kind of like everything makes sense for the first time. You're 10 years older than me, and honestly such an inspiration.
One of the things which might effect the validity of this video is Contra point's trans perspective bias. Since Contra points is a transsexual man, any unfavorable information might be filtered out by his brain to maintain a blissful state of mind in accordance to the belief he is a female.
The ending song was actually kind of touching
all men are hypersexual perverts, it just gets wilder when women aren't around
it's like a crate and barrel article
God, thank you Contra. If only I'd seen this months ago when I got accused of being an Autogynephiliac and thought I was a pervert who couldn't be a girl. The video really needs more circulation so others don't have to go through anything like that. You really are a blessing.
YOUR SINGING MAKES ME CRY IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND SAD
On a facebook group for trans professionals, a transman looking for a mentor for psychology grad research said he had been recommended by a faculty member to work with Michael Bailey, and he was asking on this forum if anyone knew about him or another possible candidate. LOL. This student didn't know who he was. LMAO. Anyway, I haven't watched this video yet, so I don't know if you got into Anne Lawrence or Blanchard yet, since they are all cut from the same cloth, but Anne Lawrence was actually the first professional I saw when I was 14 and trying to get on hormones. It was early days for internet resources in the early 2000s, and I had no idea what I was walking into.  She charged my mom several hundred dollars, and basically just kept asking me questions like 'have you ever been aroused by wearing women's clothes?', 'have you ever masturbated while wearing your mother's clothing', etcetera. She knew that she wasn't prescribing hormones to anyone at the time (I was seeking a harm reduction prescription because I hit puberty hard at like 10 and thought I should at least be allowed spironolactone prior to a year of therapy), but saw me anyway, and all she did was refer me to a guy whose office door I could literally reach from her office, and I saw him to get my letter (eventually). After parting with several hundred dollars.  Just thought I'd share my stories.
I read "galileo's middle finger" recently and I'm super glad you touched on it I kept trying to find stuff about Alice Dreger but found nothing that wasn't eating her up. I still really enjoyed the book but she spent SOOOOO long just painting Bailey as a great champion of being not homophobic^tm.  Also you are amazing plz keep kicking ass!
Watching this after several older videos this makes some things very clear. Thank you and all the best.
I learned a lot. You seem like a nice lady, I hope you find what you're looking for.
30 minutes in and as a cis bisexual dude I'm left with so many questions about myself that I'm not gonna be able to sleep tonight. Good video though.
Que the Jordan Peterson fans saying their free speech is being violated
That level of honesty was seriously impressive. Clearly, it took a lot of bravery, and I'm sure the vast majority of your audience will only respect you more for it. Thank you for your fascinating insight.
I really enjoyed this video, I think it was quite enlightening even as someone who already believed in the validity of trans people. I think you characterized the typical tends and differences of male and female sexual desire incredibly well. I think there is often a blind spot to men and women experiencing sexual desire in different ways and the role hormones play in that. I also commend you for your bravery by sharing your personal sexual experiences. As one who has both dated very 'effeminate' men and has known some trans women I can to some degree understand your experiences.
I am definitely Cluster B.   Also, I don't see the problem with loving myself as a tranny.  I adore how I look in drag!
Okay, so Ray Blanchard has a theory. That's not science, it's an opinion. The whole field is opinions. The thing with psychology, is that it's a lot more like archaeology and history than maths or physics. It's technical, it's detective work, it's full of opinions and theories, it's full of academic scholars. It's not science. I don't care how much psychologists protest—they're not scientists.
You are beautiful and very eloquent.
You should read about Rousseau's  "amour de soi" if you have not already, it will greatly add to your argument and give it some historical precedence. Excellent "confessions" even if you only accept the conservative critique of the social sciences when it suits you; you should apply this to every group they are oppressing with their pseudoscience (70%+ of their "studies" are not reproducible). Female vanity isn't a trope or false or a male projection, it seems to be necessary and maybe the due to the need to focus on a potential child (the concept is the glaring vacuum in the video and I would really like to hear your take on this). Thanks for the openness and your lighting is amazing.
This is amazing, and thank u
"someone... please fuck me.." i laughed super hard, you are the best Boss  ♥  c':
*looks up the fucksaw incident*  Well, I didn’t know what I was expecting
Just popped in to assure you that this cis woman likes wearing bras to sleep! The only reason I don't is paranoia about sagging breasts later in life. You are an amazing lady, and I am so lucky to have found your channel!
I'm AMAB and identify as genderqueer/pangender/other things like that. In almost every aspect of my life, gender simply doesn't matter to me; I don't think of myself as male or female or masculine or feminine or anything, I may as well be genderless. But in sexual matters, I want someone to suck my tits and fuck my (nonexistent) pussy, or at least as close to that as is physically possible. I've felt the term "autogynephilia" pretty fitting for myself, because of that. How do you account for people like me?
wow that was awesome. thank you for informing me, once more. have a good one
i am honestly so grateful this channel exists
If only for that confession, I wish I could give 50 likes. I'm happy to see someone shares some of my experiences
This is so brave. You've done more than anybody should have to. I've learned a lot about the trans experiences. Thank you so much.
Fantastic as usual! just need to say as a filthy man pervert that you are extremely attractive and your majestic beauty makes concentrating on the content of the video very difficult. You actually have to tone it down please.
this video really did a number on my now I am in doubt of myself and mind and my gender (as a genderqueer person) in a terrible way. therapy here I come I guess, or better yet -- to the bottle!
It's not only that your videos are extremely well produced and you have put so much thought and effort into it - it's also like everytime you post a video it's like you speak _ my _ mind while speaking yours. Thanks for restoring my sanity on a regular basis. <3
I can not thank You enough for making this video.
I so badly wish there was more intelligent people, like You out there, but unfortunatly it seems to be a minority in the world...
This makes me feel stuff.   I too masculine and disgusting to be a girl and too weak and feminine to be a man. Kill me pls
It is possible to work as sex researcher?  I have wasted my life😦
Apparently, people having crushes on themselves does exist. A quick search into quora reviles that it happens quite a bit to cisgender people. And if this is the case, why couldn't it happen to some transgenders? It's a weird sexual kink, but then again, there are hundreds of weird sexual kinks that cis and trans people experiment with.
I took a break from watching your videos for a while because I needed a break from politics and I literally jumped at the difference in how your voice sounds now compared to your older videos.
20 minutes in and now i know where all TERFs seem to get their ideology from. Thanks, Blanchard.
Would you ever do a video about your experience with Philosophy? Specifically advise for undergrad philosophy majors?
Natalie you give me life, notice me
I’m not even trans or involved in LGBT shit and I watched this video around 10 times while studying for exams
I gotta say that I absolutely love the use of color in your videos!
amazing video <3
I JUST got that Abiligail is into BDSM now from the whippy thing and that is some hillarious character development.
this made me think of something i said to someone that was a joke once. I meant it in a way to validate them while disparaging someone else, but now i realize how it could of been perceived as insulting to that person as well.  thanks for illuminating my error, so i can not be a dick in the future.
i could listen to you play piano all day tbh
I am tempted to write smut about you at you but I don't want to objectify another woman on the internet☺😚
Thankyou so much for this video. I have been embarrassing myself repeatedly by typing dismorphia instead of disphoria. I am interested in the weird ways terfs try to justify their hatred and lack of understanding. Now I know more about where it comes from.
merci
As someone attempting to understand my own gender, thank you. This helps so much. Rocky horror sux though :P
When will scientists stop being transphobic dickwads and just invent body transference or something
I like my own body odor...
I assure you that some CIS ladies (me. i'm talking about me) do sleep in bras. Im so happy my lazy ass finally looked into your channel. I'm binging (is that the right spelling? whatever lol) your vids hard lol
One of the best videos I’ve ever seen. In  tears. Thank you!
So while this video did explain to me something I've been confused about, I'm gonna have to scream into the void about it because Contra's descriptions during part 6 have hit way too close to home and have shown me why exactly I need to start pursuing transition a lot lot lot more. And also caused me to have a fucking emotional breakdown at 2 AM. Thank you.
Now if only people like Ben Shapiro could see trans people as maybe not mentally insane we could have an even less toxic community.
This video is super interesting so far. I really love the lighting. Especially the red/green.
A two-sided mirror, what does it mean????!!!!!
I have no doubt a decade from now you will be in a far more brighter and uplifting state than you could ever imagine. Keep being positive.
So what about all the neuroimaging evidence that is slowly building up and basically confirming Blanchard? Starting with Rametti and Savic 2011. If we just ignore all the talk and the fact that there are self-admitted autogynephiles.
Even if I was only transitioning because I want to look hot like... who cares? Give me my damn tiddie skittles.
I'm glad you did this video, and I appreciate your courage in doing so. It's always nice for me when I can see another side of things in clear, unambiguous ways,  but often the things hidden from mainstream views are that way because of how difficult it is for any individual person to toss out the often incredibly personal details in front of an audience that is, more often than not, going to rip   your exposed feelings to shreds.  So yeah, appreciate the video, and I hope you get what you're looking for in life (by which I obviously mean the destruction of bourgeois oppression over the proletariat!)   As a last point: Tim Curry is the best Dr. Frank'n'Furter of all time, and I will fucking fight you!
That was educative.
as i man i never felt like a man, i want to be desired, i love a woman when i can talk to her for hours. i feel that line, woman will never be attracted to me, the way im attracted to them. i do imagine being a woman and feel aroused thinking what its like to be desired as a man.
How would you address the fact that a subset of trans people actually identify as autogynophiles? How can you be so sure that 'gender dysphoria' is the one and only cause of this complex set of identities that get grouped under 'trans'?
Actually, dogs do go to heaven.
I’m so excited to see the journey your singing voice will take! Amongst the many other things you offer of yourself that affirm and uplift me, so thank you Nat!
I'm 10 minutes in and it's definitely confirmed something I already thought. A decent chunk of Sexologists are just projecting their fetishes onto life.
14:00 - i actually hoped you'd read the science to me, or read it for me and digest it and summarise it, i like science, but i don't like reading. but filth is good too.
plz let me n my gf Fuck u bonded to the bed spread eagle, u said plz Fuck me,  I'm not a creeper I'm supplying a need.   if u look up my rapper name Ull find me on facebook It Child.  (I don't actual expect you to message, just wishful thinking lol) 😎
Hey Contra, a professor named Amy Marv's doing a trans studies course at the University of Oregon which features this video on the syllabus. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ldVyrqsRAqkY8CCugaVvD1SehEyx-Tqfo4EWhonkcQI/edit !!!
Not sure if it's the drug regimen or your mental state since the last time you played, but your piano seems more emotive and your voice weaker overall. Fair trade, says I, but your mileage may vary.
While this provided a lot of really interesting and eye-opening insight into what it's like to experience gender dysphoria and transition, you finally solved my long-lived confusion with myself (as a teenager bisexual cis girl) - regarding the ways my attraction to people works. I always measured my attraction to girls via comparison with hetero males and found a strange disconnection - I didn't care THAT MUCH about appearance and curves and whatever, preferring little intimate things and interpersonal connection. Furthermore, the same goes for my attraction to boys! Holy shit I felt so lost for so long, contemplating whether I'm even attracted to anyone in the first place!  Turns out it's a girl thing. God I'm so glad this shit is over with. Thank you so much Contra. You're really cute by the way <3
"Sometimes you have to explain what it means to be trans to a person who believes that dogs go to heaven." Brilliant. This is why I love your videos. Keep it up!
hi please do a vid on bisexuality
This is really impressive on so many levels. I hope you can look back on this and go "fuck, that was an amazing thing to do"
Damn you look so good Natalie I see you girl😊😉 Great video as always keep it up. I love your longer videos😍😍😍😎😎👍💗💗
"cross sex gender fantasy" more like gender euphoria?
You're one of my favorite YouTubers hhhh
I'm a 23 year old CIS woman and I need to orgasm once a day or else I can't focus on schoolwork who can relate
I tend to believe people when they say they feel X emotion. I've been victim of my anxiety disorder being discounted as not existing, it sucks. But the experiences did make me realise that humans like to project.   My parents don't have OCD- if they acted as I did (obsessively washing, keeping things in a certain order), it would likely stem from a place of attention seeking. But I do have OCD, and as such I experience an anxiety that they don't- so when I do these things, it's stemming from a place of anxiety- an anxiety they don't have.  They assume my brain works like theirs- after all their minds are the only minds they really know. Because the only reason *they* would act like that is to seek attention, they assume that's why I do those things.  The lession is that people have different reasons for doing things because our minds are different. Person A might react to stimulus C vastly differently than Person B. And since we don't have mind reading devices (yet), the best we can do is take people's word on what they feel. Most people are honest and have a decent grasp on what they feel.
Disgusting
"cis women don't sleep wearing their bras" is weirdly affirming actually because im a trans man and......sometimes im too lazy to take off my compression bra (i know this is unhealthy i am slowly working out of the habit)
14:17 is so cute
omg this vid makes me want to transition even more
tbh i googled your name yesterday bc i was crossfaded and couldnt find your name on youtube? but you are awesome and Real Smart and i love your musical credits as ive said before also i never really understood the appeal of rocky horror, despite watching it, until you explained here! you really clarified a ton of stuff on this, and as a nonbinary trans person, i really appreciate knowing as much as i can learn about trans experiences i dont necessarily have myself
I feel like the reason people gravitate to the theory is also, that they can't understand the idea of not feeling like you belong into your own body, so they want it to be something they can clearly disassociate with and for it to be perverse.
you look really cute as Abigail The Terf the pink hair suits ya
Bloody 'ell, Cockbane looks like the new Dr Who.
Who TF resurrected this old nonsense? I thought this whole trope died along with AOL message boards. Is it the TERFs, have they been clutching at any straw out there?
The double bind of having to dehumanize one's self in order to present an 'academic' defense of one's self isn't discussed directly nearly enough. Thank you for doing this.
30:51 Hahaha ! Captain Edward Reynolds !
I look at my stomach and say, 'hey, I'm hungry.' I look at my clock and say, 'hey, the place I want to go closes in an hour.' I look at my shoes and think, 'hey, I'm all ready to go.' Then I look at this video and think, 'fuck it, I'll just eat tomorrow.'
go on chapo
I'm a trans man and my sexual desires were changed by T in pretty much the exact way yours were, in reverse (with the exception of sexual orientation).
Actually, there's only one thing about this video which makes me feel a bit uncomfortable as a trans woman... Why does Abigail remind me so much of myself? O.o
I love you! Scientifically accurate, sexy af and smart. I love your femenine non binarity and fluid sexuality.
Wow, so TERFs basically believe a made up "scientific theory" based in transphobia to describe trans people, then claim that they're not transphobic🙄🙄 Thank you for making this video, it helps me be a better ally to trans women and better assist y'all in your civil rights journey. I really hope you took some time for self care after making this because I can only imagine how triggering something like this is for you.
Wow. A good wow. Absolutely wow.
🎶”Myself I shall adore, If I persist in gazing”
I've always felt more like a man who feels like he should have been a woman, but still retain a preference for female sex partners. A lesbian trapped in a man's body so to speak. I guess Blanchard didnt invite me to the party.
I'm not googling a term like "fucksaw". Anyone want to give the sparknotes version?
What's the point of Autogynephilia when you look like a Shin from Hokuto no Ken.
Autogynephile or just a highly neurotic male?
I've watched this so many times I've lost count. Someone remind me to make a trans guy response video on the aspects Blanchard's theory he like, didn't bother to include cause he was too thirsty for drama.
I’m often late to these videos, but it strikes me that “autogynephilia” theory supports “male gaze” theory as a by product of the internalized gaze. Regardless if the woman is cishet or trans.
This was published on my birthday. Thanks for the gift. PS - you're hot.
This is extremely informative, thank you! It's very validating to hear that someone as far along as you has had similar experiences to me.   Also: no matter what your dysphoria says, you look and sound female already. You're the goal, basically!
As a cis male, I'd just like to point out that I'd smash Abigail into the ground. (sexually)
Fucking goddamn this is a brave video.
As a cis pansexual woman (who mostly prefers women and femmes) I feel that your description of the nuances of female sexuality were fairly accurate to my own sexual feelings. All of your videos are very informative and well thought out, but I was particularly impressed by this one. It takes a lot to grab someone's attention for 50 minutes while mostly just talking about some very complex issues, but I was genuinely engaged the entire time. I do love when you cut to little characters and skits and artsy shots, but I also like that this video didn't rely on them as much (sure it's included at the end, but it made sense). I think what makes your videos so refreshing (besides from the obvious creativity and great tongue-in-cheek humor) is that you really take your time to consider questions your audience might have before we even have a chance to ask them. It shows that you don't just react, but you take time to *respond,* which is a rare and valuable trait to find on the internet. Thank you, Natalie, for delving into such a difficult and apparently very personal topic.
I have never heard anyone so succinctly describe the internal sexual feelings and how they changed throughout transition for me like you did halfway through this video. I had to stop and rewatch it a few times. All the way through the entire video I found myself nodding, so happy that we have you as a representative. Keep it up. Super glad I found you through Shaun and Hbomberguy. I can't wait to see more of you!
You are so lovely!
"Autogynephilia, autogynephilia Pumpkins scream in the dead of niiiiiiight"
Damn, I clicked this video thinking I'd just watch a few minutes and then hop off to do something else, but I was sucked into watching all 50 minutes.  Your videos are all super informative, keep it up!
This was incredible on all accounts
You are so cool can i be part of you cyber entourage?
Internet anti-celebrity Chris Chan is the ultimate example of an autogynephilc transsexual, so why is he not mentioned here?
*ragged, quiet sobbing*
That Blanchard guy seems like genius, perfectly describes my experience as a trans person....really gives me a lot to think about..
I wouldn't ascribe "wanting to be wanted" as opposed to "wanting to have someone" to being female. I'd rather say it relates to whether you tend to have a inferiority complex or superiority complex
i love ContraPoints ,i love you !
You are my hero.When I came here, I was expecting to be greeted by the usual onslaught of heavy handed trans-purist propaganda. Yet you present the issues fairly and equitably. and your points are so reasonable and well articulated. I'm thankful to be your newest subscriber!
15:24 if you want proof of that: high heels were originally intended for men
trans guy here- as a professional AFAB who has yet to slice off the ol’ Chest Meat, i sleep in a bra all the time. even before i knew i was trans. maybe it’s bc i was cursed with Zonkin Bonkhonkaloos, but it’s just more comfortable!
Yasss Rocky Horror
Thank you for your honesty, boldness, and courage.
Top notch video as always, and I think it was both incredibly brave and selfless for you to be so open about your experience. I think you're lovely and beautiful and I'm really glad that you have this platform
I just googled the fucksaw 😳😳😂 Truth is truly stranger than fiction
You're funny. I like that.
bless, thank you!! very relatable.
Hey, I know you probably won't see or read this comment, but I watched this entire video and holy shit you helped me understand so much stuff about myself, that I have to write anyway for the slim chance you'll see it. This has been so helpful and informative and made me realize a lot about me since I really do feel the same way as you on a lot of things. i'm writing from a throwaway account since I still don't feel good enough to comment about something like this from my own account, but after seeing this I'm much more certain of myself that I want to transition. I'm still terrified of the idea, but it's mainly because of outside opinions now and no longer because of myself, and I thank you for that. Also one of my biggest fears is not being passable if I transition, and seeing how beautiful you are just made me doubt myself much less, so thank you again for making this video and for being the amazing person that you are!!
I've liked this channel for 2-3 years. It felt like for a while there you were going overboard with the skits and seemed really unsettled/upset. I admit I'm a little relieved you went back to armchair-style videos.   It must have been really hard to make this one. But it reminded me that you're still the same bold and outspoken person that I admired from the start. Now you're the bold, outspoken and honest Contrapoints 2.0 that seems more confident and genuinely happy! And you deserve to be happy. Your heart is beautiful and I'm glad you've shared it with us. :D Thank you! For being yourself. <3   I love you as any gender, even the 52nd one. So feel free to oscillate between them all in a confusing blur. I'll still be here.
I bet this video took more effort to create and publish than I could ever know, and because of your efforts many of us are better people. Thank you so much, Contra!
The reasons and feelings going. You stated about why and how you transitioned and your journey might as well have been about me. Journeys are very similar.
I would rim you so good. ;)
Thank you 🙌
Great Video.  I think Blanchard's autogynophilia idea is just a repackaged form of Femmephobia.
I honestly don’t understand why there are people who don’t like you. You are such an interesting youtuber. I love watching your videos both for their esthetic/atmosphere and their educational value. I learn so much about philosophy and a variety of experiences that I am not exposed to. Thank you for that!
autogynephilia is the truth, trannys calling regular guys that like them as women 'tranny chasers' is the real lie!  the only real trans are intersex, that have tiny and useless cock and balls!
ILY
I want to note that recently I've seen terfs and others applying this "theory" to trans men as well,  accusing gay trans men, especially if they show interest in male romantic or sexual pairings in media, of fetishizing gay men and being the equivalent to "autogynephiles". It's awful.
You will realize the damage porn has done to you ten years from, your body ravaged from years of taking sex altering hormones, while clutching a 12 gauge in your right hand.
I'm a cis-male. I've struggled with my feelings of being beautiful while engaging in transvestism. I've struggled with my bisexuality. I've struggled with other people's feelings about my bisexuality. I've struggled with whether I'm gender queer or even possibly trans. I've struggled with whether I believe in gender at all. I've struggled with whether I may just be entirely heterosexual or homosexual. Fuck, I've struggled with whether I've accurately conceptualized on a conscious level how much I've struggled and what complex neurosis may be secretly motivating each particular feeling, impulse, or inclination.  The point is that my feelings on my sex and gender are very difficult and confusing when I'm not even trans. So listening to you and your gut-wrenching honesty my brain kinda did itself in trying to empathize with how unbelievably difficult this must have been to talk about, let alone live through/with. I just wanted to thank you for the incredible bravery-- hate that word but it's appropriate-- it must have taken to be this candid about such incredibly difficult subjects and, in whatever infinitesimal worth there is in it, let you know that I support and admire you.  Edit: I'm now paranoid that I've referred to my struggles so many times that I may have accidentally summoned Hitler's ghost.
Contrapoints thanks for making this video. It helped me understand my own sexual and gender confusion a bit more. Btw I don't think you will have any trouble finding love and exeptance for who you are your talented funny and smart as long as your stomping around in life being yourself you will attract someone that will impress you.
That was amazing.
You're so beautiful, Contra ;;;;;;
amazing video, as always. love you contra
I find this interesting and intelligent. And in part hilarious :) Humor makes life a bit bearable anyway. I admire people that are not afraid to bare their soul so to speak.
okay, i finally finished the video, is it okay if i leave one more comment? i just wanted to say that i appreciate what all you expressed and confided in this video, and that i think you're a beautiful woman. have a nice day :)   P.S. i love that someone named themself "a bowl of creamy tomato soup" like lol? also, someone's name is Reasonably Agitated Honey Bee, that is wonderful xD ... oh wait, i didn't get mentioned in the Patrons list? :( sad face...
As a trans boy, hearing you say “there is only biology, habitual behavior, and the way society responds to you” made me gasp. I’ve been looking for those words to describe how I feel since I realized I was trans. I’ve felt terrible for not “being a boy” until I realized my trans-ness, so thank you for validating how sometimes your concept of yourself and your gender can change as you grow and change. It means a lot.
Name of the opening aria, please, anyone?
Fantastic vid. You got a new fan. As to Bailey: edgelord sounds accurate, esp re the saw thing... why was a live demo needed in 2011? I mean there’s internet then...
I love the whole sexual history section.
A couple of years ago, I was invited to see a play. I had heard of the name _Rocky horror picture show,_ but I never saw the movie or knew what it was about. I was taken _quite_ off guard.
Video was great! And btw many busty cis women sleep in our bras for physical support. Sleeping in a bra is not atypical behavior for women. Keep doing what feels right!
The "original" music Zoe Blade wrote, relies heavily on Prokofiev´s Dance of the Knights. She wrote a sound-alike. People should give classical music more credit.
Genuinely thank you so much for making this. This really helped me with some of my own thoughts on subject (and believe me, I've had my share of self hatred over the accusation)
❤
Has contrapoints done ten songs yet? If so we need a top ten video
I’d like to see Tammy go after Blanchard, literally...as in with a bat
there is such a thing as autogynephilic men. claiming that nobody that has ever transitioned did so because of autogynephilia is simply false.
As a young cis man this was not only informative as to the psychology of trans women and even cis women. You’re videos are great as always.
Does the rejection of the gender essence and autogynephilia theories for the 'dysphoria' theory necessarily invalidate non-dysphoric transgender people? Or is there some way to explain them?
Your brain is AWESOME.
I want to dissent to the concept of ciswomen not being turned on by the fundamental idea of having "female" bodies. You've already touched on the concepts of the male gaze and projection, but plenty of women (and myself, before I transitioned) experience an "out of body" or third person view of themselves in sexual situations. They may be more into the idea of watching themselves fuck, rather than be in the poundtown driver's seat. I think it's in part due to media (especially super accesible pornogrpahy) making the male gaze so default, plus the societal importance of a man's sexual gratification. I was attracted to women, as a women, but in the way a cishetero dude would be (won't get into that. Yuck.) I never saw myself as a woman in situations with other women. And when I was with men I would find myself more attracted to the idea of my body being sexed up by a guy, rather than my actual SELF getting the sexing. This probably contributes to the idea of "all women being bisexual." Maybe? Sure, but it's a hell of a lot easier to be attracted to women when you've been brought up with their bodies being heavily sexualized since you were a child.
tl;dw the problem is confused by the issue of actual trans people vs transtrenders. I've watched a dude on twitter who likes to wear a dress occasionally screaming about 'girldicks', and another bearded goblin who doesn't even bother with the dress living his online life as a woman. of course, I could just go to tumblr and see thousands and thousands of these.  hopefully, by skipping most of it, I missed the part where you address the appropriation of an actual identity by people who want to use it as a handbag. you know, those folks otherwise known as autogynephiles.
I agree, it does suck that you're so much smarter than us.  No one can validate you because no one is qualified.
Very controversial. _Very provocative._ *Very politically incorrect.* *_I have been triggered._* *_WELL DONE_*
Thank you, ContraPoints, for being brave enough to take on the theories of so-called experts. I also hope that we cis people will understand why not all trans people feel comfortable talking about such intimate details of their sexuality.
holy crap that is a lot to take in but thank you for thanking the time an doing this like always you do wonderful work.
Holy shit. The judge's wig is an astonishingly good look on you. Cute! Or maybe it's the glasses? Or the combo? ...Either way, that is a highly, if slightly confusingly (seriously, a judge's wig looks good on someone?!), flattering look.  Erm... I wasn't going to comment, because I don't have much to add, and "great video" seems like a slightly rubbish contribution and now I'm embarrassed that my only real contribution is that you look cute dressed as an agent of the carceral system. So... great video!
Woah, I heard about the fucksaw thing before but didn't know much about John Michael Bailey. Ew. (ew because I hate when people with shitty beliefs are in charge of teaching students about topics that need to be taught). And ugh, Jordan Peterson. UGH.   Also, I was watching this video, and my boyfriend noticed and was all "Holy crap! Her transition is going well". I agree! I hope all is good with you, ContraPoints.
ZOË BLADE
God dammit I found this video the day after someone tried to use “autogynephilia” as a defender for their transphobia on Twitter. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO USEFUL.
I wanna have sex as a walrus. You just get to lay there, be fat and lazy, and make loud, deep grunting noises. I mean, who doesn't love that?
I really like the music in this. Found myself randomly dancing. Zoe Blade is good!
thanks for this informative video
There's a lot here I could praise, but honestly I just wanted to say it's actually really validating to hear I'm not the only trans woman who sleeps in their bra. (44:28)
"someone please fuck me" I VOLUNTEER AS TRIBUTE
Awesome video. Fearless!
i'm really glad i watched this video, even though i don't care about this Blanchard fool. i had a feeling that i would regret it if i passed on this video, and so i'm happy that i made it through the educational parts about how people like Blanchard are narrow-minded pseudo-intellectuals.   i hate to admit it, but i think i have a small crush on you, Natalie, but i know nothing can come of it because 1: i'm male and you prefer women, and 2: i'm libertarian and i'm afraid our differences in political opinion would turn you off.   i consider myself queer to an extent, discovering my sexuality early before i even really understood what masturbation was technically, i would hump things when i was as young as in 4th grade, like the edge of bannisters or swing set legs and i without realizing what orgasms were, would come in my pants.   i started crossdressing i think when i was about 10 or 11 years old, usually in family members clothes, and typically without their permission, but later in life i started buying my own girls clothes. i was never happy with my appearance so i keep photos of me secret, mainly because i don't find myself attractive enough dressed as a female.   i never really wanted to "get laid" in fact i grew up with Disney films and i had this obsessed idea of finding a "soulmate" as young as 14 years old, but between my immaturity, social ineptitude, late discovery of Asperger's Syndrome, depression, bad eating and sleeping habits, i only ended up being a weird spaztastic creep who girls avoided.   when i grew up and started becoming more self-aware, this made me more depressed because i realized that i was spiraling down a mental path that would only bring me misery, yet it was an addicting emotional pain that stuck to me like cement, and even to this day i am chipping away at my self-hatred.   anyway, i'm done blah blah blahing. thank you for sharing your personal story, Natalie, i like how you are open about this stuff :)   i want you. but that doesn't mean anything coming from me, unfortunately, i kinda fail at life. i want someone who is superior than me to want you.   hmmm... you know, when i think about it, i may be autogynephilic... when i was still a kid, crossdressing was just something weird and devious to do, and to experiment with what i considered taboo.   as i grew into it, more and more, i got turned on by the idea of me being able to transform temporarily into a woman, to either have lesbian sex, or even have sex with men as a woman.   and i don't even really consider myself bisexual really, but yet i can imagine myself, if in the right mood, with just the right person and situation, i would not oppose a homosexual encounter.   i take care to say this though because i feel like there are parts of my psyche' that are not genuinely interested in males like that, and i'm worried to string anyone along because i feel like any level of homosexuality in me may just be as part of momentary kinks.   anyways, i'm 36 minutes in and my ADD is kicking in, time to play Guild Wars 2. i'll finish the video later, but i think this comment is good enough.
I am gonna have to disagree with you about physical attractiveness of men, because lord help my knees in the face of bulging, powerful shoulders and abs you could iron a curtain on.
From the camera work, to the editing, to the information you hit it all out of the park Natalie! Thank you for such a wonderful insight into a topic I didn’t know too much about.
this is the most intelligent, warm and beautiful thing i have ever seen on the internet. i feel like you made this for me. WHY ARE OTHER PEOPLE COMMENTING? MINE. lol. xxx
What is that beautiful singing in the beginning? I must know!
third time watching this. I love this soooo much
i think another problem that the theory falls into is the notion that women are inherently unloveable. it's seen a lot in arguments against bisexuality, that women are just straight and looking for attention and men are just gay and afraid, it all comes back to being attracted to men, that no one could really be attracted to women. again we see the only 'true' option for attraction given to women is men. it's just the same shit with different coloured glitter slapped on ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
As I watch this (feb '18), the blog you mentioned, crossdreamers, has a post about this video as the first thing you see
Natalie, if we ever meet and end up hitting it off, I'm open to sexy times ;)
I like that you argue your points instead of getting offended at people who disagree with you.
Wow, just wow. Thank you so much for this video! You explained a ton of stuff and explored a lot of lines of thinking- and you talked about some really deep/personal parts of your life. I'm so grateful for everything you've given us with this video. Thank you so much!!! <3
No bashthefash? No likes! >:(  jk. Great vid. I would smash the like button again for the openness as well.
The pirate porn reference was funny.
I am not sure if you do a written script for all of your videos but sometimes the points are so nuanced I would really love it if you would publish the script or a written version somewhere. Maybe it is just me but I feel I understand more reading rather than listening. But I love all your videos and appreciate all your sick skits.
This was so brilliant, informative, creative, hilarious, touching... I LOVE YOU SM.
As someone split right down the middle just saying thanks for these vids
My goodness, Natalie, as a straight guy I never realized how terrifying gender dysphoria can be. If I ever meet you in real life I wanna give you a hug!
Thank you from the bottom of the well (of my heart, that is) for your time and effort in making these videos, and especially for your candid and brave expositions of your situation and experiences! Your audience is deeply grateful <3 Phew
Your skin is on point!!!
So many similarities with my own experience as a transwoman. I saw silence of the lambs and ave ventura as a kid and it made me just assume that i was an evil pervert or something. I've had to go through the exact same thought processes in order to view myself in the proper light, not autogynephilic, not a villain. Not a perv. Thank you for making this.
Your aesthetic is really interesting and you're so well spoken! I'm watching this and I'm just like, "what a woman!!"
Seriously?  This video is fucking badass.  Well done, Natalie.
The fucksaw incident lmao
the amazing thing is that here in melbourne until the clinics picked up informed consent like last year trans guys still had to go through the Interview where we had to prove wearing jeans and a cap didn't give us a boner (as well as "do you have autism or DID or schizotypal problems check MATE you cant be trans youre too crazy") based on... i assume "well thats what we do for trans women so uhh i guess its the same on the other side lolllll"
Strange how this theory explains gender bender hentai. Though typically for a cis het male audience.
I think I love a set of leftist youtubers more than I love myself.
I f i n d o u t l a t e r t h a t s h e i s f r o m b e l i z e
So much clarity. You're Fine!
This was so amazing, that I'm disappointed I finished it.
I absolutely love this video! I remember seeing that study a year or two ago, and it honestly made me completely unsure about my own identity as a trans girl, but you completely proved every point wrong. Also you're actually #transitiongoals, keep it up!
Great video ,  I just can't get the 80's song " heterosexual man " out of my head 😂
i almost don't want to watch the video because i never heard of this term nor have i heard of this Blanchard person, and i already understand transfolk well enough from watching Ash Hardell, Blaire White, and RolyUnGashaa videos. yet... it's a Contra video... and it's hard to say no to the lovely miss Natalie. i'm posting this comment early though since i tend to pause and resume long videos randomly at my leisure, blame it on my ADD.
idiot
this is everything. THANK YOU!!!
You're very incredibly brave.   The way you introduce serious topics with accessibility to everyone to understand them is really awesome, as well as the humor.   By the way... I really hope it doesn't offend you or anything, but you look a lot like Jenna Marbles to me? I am not sure why, maybe the hair? Your hair is also really pretty. You're in general almost overwhelmingly pretty.   I'm a transguy, so it's interesting to see the viewpoint from the other side. I know some of it, because I have transwomen friends, but the discussions are usually about dysphoria and not philosophy. (Which, dysphoria freaking sucks.) I'm most intrigued by the changes you observed going on hormones. I've not yet started that part of my transition (though i do live socially as male, if not really... super passing) and it's both exciting and nerve-wracking to think about the changes hormones cause.   Thank you for sharing this video, it must have been difficult.
Super proud of you, Natalie! :)
Contrapoints videos are so good they almost hurt my feelings.
As a cis het woman does it means that I’m becoming a lesbian because I’m developing a huge crush on you?
oh wow you are incredible i am so glad i found your channel
Very interesting video, though at 50 minutes of brain burning goodness I'll need a second viewing, cause I'm pretty sure a lot of it hasn't sunk in yet. But more importantly, I feel the need to hug people now, so please hug yourselves for me, if you would be so kind. Thanks.
Thank you for sharing your life. It is informative and interesting... and you are so well informed... and cute:)
19:32  "More women are into feminizing boys than you might think."  Oh shit where they at
@18:20 Waaait... born in '88? Sooo... that makes me five years /older/ than ContraPoints? Of all the things I didn't expect to find out from this video, that was the last thing I wasn't expecting. X3 Great vid, beautiful story.
I’m sure you’ve gotten this before, but I still need to say it since I’m new here. Your lighting is amazing. The other stuff is good to but that goes without saying.
Zinnia Jones is a piece of shit. Please, no more.
I might cry at the end of this video rn

True true true
Hey, I just love the music on your videos. Does Zoe have albums of her own? Where can I find more of her music?
Wooow. Not fair. I'm so jealous of how your singing voice sounds. I stop passing the moment I start singing. :c
Really, biology doesn't relate with gender/sex? You think that gender/sex is all socially constructed? Most people don't fall into one of the two main genders/sexes, male and female? Biological male and femaleness doesn't just manifest in sex chromosomes... There's also male and female neurology, which is informed by those chromosomes. Men and women mostly want different things in life, as per career.  I'm libertarian, straight, cis, heterosexual. Fan of Jordan Peterson, I can't stand postmodernism. I'm excited to explore your channel more though, it's great to hear someone on the left really work to articulate their views. I'm not sure to what extent you're postmodern, I think all people are a bit, but we'll see :)
im very curious about your view of antinatalism, +ContraPoints! not sure i'll get a response... but i'd love one!
Are u crossdressing or transsgender or a girl?
This sounds very tedious and tiring.. makes my anxiety run wild. Having said that, I respect you for sharing and I found this video very informative. Why must our brains be so complex ?!?!? #RealityStressesMeOut
"I sleep in a bra -- which I feel no cis woman ever does"  Well, my girlfriend only sleeps in a bra and actually feels very uncomfortable not wearing a bra, so there's that.
Epic video!
Mmmmmm, hypersexual perversion.
I really just. Fucking love you.
I'm pro science, and pro post-modernism. No cognitive dissonance here.
Girl! this is so on point! I literally clapped a couple times! YESSSS
Thank you for making this video. It has offered insight into matters that I never could understand. It has put into perspective, not only a world that is foreign to me, but also my cruel inconsideration of people in my life to whom this was a reality. Your videos are thoughtful and insightful, and they improve my personal understanding of the world, and strengthens my ability to be considerate, empathetic and understanding of others. (fuck me this sounds pretentious.) Keep it up, ContraPoints. You are one of my favourite Youtubers. Thank you.
Popper's work on the philosophy of science points out that a science is only science if it *can* be wrong.  This strikes me like Freudian psychology, which really can't be falsified, and thus isn't scientific theory or hypothesis since it's just a framework of interpretation.  Same here with autogynephilia; notably, not science.
Lol your experience with sexuality as a woman is exactly like mine except I'm cis. It's confusing af, much strength to you sis
Thank you for making this
The dark mother strikes again,  she's always there waiting... waiting for you to crack... waiting for the release of the inner woman      Lol I kid your awesome contra and I love your videos
"And who can blame them... *slurp*". Favorite person ever.
I'd like to see you do a video on the differences between colloquial and technical/philosophical type language. I think there's a huge issue there simply because a lot of people don't seem to realise there is a difference.
Wow 😯
Contra you were so much better when you were just a self-proclaimed, out and proud cross-dressing fetishist with no shame. I used to admire that in you. But now you've drank the Kool-Aid- you've lost your edge.  By attempting to denounce Blanchard's typography, aren't you essentially kinkshaming transwomen? You would expect any psychological theory attempting to explain transgenderism to address the reality of sexual motives surely? Its part of being human.
This video is amazing!
I would pay good money for a "The Man Who Would Be Queen" audiobook read by Peter Coffin as he narrated it in this video. But only if J. Michael Bailey didn't profit in any way.
I'm trans myself and too bad all this trans politics stuff gets turned into calculus. At any rate I really appreciate your long argument. And the moment John Berger gets interjected I am on board. Good luck to you and thanks for your contribution to the conversation. I'm someone that doesn't want to waste breath and calories. I call myself a human. A feminine human.
Too long; watched anyway.
When the "peak trans" came up i was in tears, have my sub
Haha I read a PDF of the man who Would Be Queen right after deciding to transition and it was soooo horrifying it was actually hilarous. Needless to say, 2,5 years in, i love my transition, my gf and my life but sadly still havent found the time to build a sex robot :(
Autogynophiles are gay men who're closeted but still want the oppression points.
"Why not steal fashion ideas from drag queens and kinksters?  Cis women do."  Low key my favorite thing you've ever said.  Also thanks for this extremely good video.
Please stop taking estrogen. Your voice is annoying to listen to nowadays.
bailey is so edgy
@ContraPoints GOD LOVES YOU
wait, is Rocky Horror Picture Show problematic? Is it because Frank is the villain?
Autogynephile Harry S. Plinkett. Oh boy.
The arguments presented in this video are clear- and persistent- misrepresentations brought up against blanchard's hypothesis.  Particularly in regards to attaching emotional language to broad psychological categories I.E. the sneaky trickster gay man and the old creepy crossdresser. Blanchard doesn't make the distinction between homosexual transsexuals and autogynephiles- hereafter referred to as HSTS and AGP respectively- based on arbitrary feelings based observation, it's based on evidence based analysis of Blanchard's own clinical practice. The hypothesis has since been confirmed numerous times by dozens of papers in the decades since Blanchard's original publication.  Not only has the theory been confirmed by other psychologists, it has also been confirmed through brain scans. Transactivists have long claimed that brain scans of an MtF brain would show female typical anatomy. It turns out this is true, but only partially so. A review of the research on the brains of transsexuals showed that they could be divided into two groups based on one variable.  Want to guess what that variable was? That's right, transsexuals exclusively attracted to men- HSTS- were consistently found to have structures in the brain more similar to females than to males. Transsexuals attracted to women/professed asexuals- AGP- on the other hand, showed abnormal brain patterns in areas that are not sexually dimorphic. Here is the link if you want to read it. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4987404/  The fact of the matter is we KNOW this theory is true- or at least mostly true- and decades of research have confirmed that. The only reason it is obscure is because the research has been buried by activists. Whether or not you accept it is on you, but I implore you to reconsider your stance on this, as this research could possibly assist in creating more effective treatment options in the future.
This is amazing. You are awesome. I never knew anything about this theory, and it IS interesting (to this cis-male person) in a 'oh god no' kinda way. Thanks for sharing a very intimate part of yourself - your sexual development - to help clarify points of how bad this theory is. But I'm also interested because I like you and want to know more about you. The part where you say you no longer wanted to be feminized, but to be feminine I think may help get across the trans-gender experience to non-trans folk. It really breaks my heart when you said you lost all sense of physical sexual release for months upon taking the medicine...that's would be devastating to me, and I can only imagine it as a frustrating eternal torment. I really hope you get it back. I really want you to have the best life, because you're a good person and you deserve better than this.
I don't agree with feminism,but I like  the way how  you express your  beliefs.
My most burning question...who is Bailey, and tell me everything about? :)
I haven't seen you in years and I had no idea you were trans.  I'm very happy for you and you look wonderful !  This video was definitely worth watching, so much so that I will watch a second time.  So glad I found you again.
Lmfao I love the creepy ass tone and atmosphere of these videos. Don't really agree with much of your opinions but this is like the most brilliant and interesting  way of getting attention to make your point ever.  Also not sure why this was a video do we still have this bad a discrimination against trans based on this kind of thing.  I wouldn't doubt it but kinda feel like its not
God bless you, my dear. You have made me realize so much about myself- and certain other people in this world. I am a gay effeminate SJW who often feels like I have the mind and heart of a woman trapped in the body of a man, but who doesn't really want to transition because, well, being a man is just easier-- and maybe that's okay Just keep being you, gorgeous. I and so many other people love and appreciate you so much
I really like almost every aspect of this video other than the lighting choices
thank you for the video I've read up on various points of view on this and always found issues with it but nothing properly as a counter-response until now
I have to say it again...You look so beautiful!!!
Isnt being turned on by your own sexuality part of normal behaviour? I like being a sexy woman(that should be 'liked' because actually since I got ill and fat my sex drive is zero, becuse I dont turn myself on)...so if a transwoman IS turned on by herself as a female, why is that a problem?...Of course Im not saying that is the only reason that people transition , but it shouldnt NOT be a reason.
how did you get christopher doyle to do your cinematography
Oh dont bring up SOTL....It was stipulated clearly in the film that Gumb was NOT trans...He was a psychopathic sadist...
You are lookin SOOOO pretty!!!!
Interesting video as per usual :)
It may not be a valid theory for transsexuals, but its a real fetish!
I'm always happy to hear you talk about your experience and put it into words. Your identity and situation are very similar to my own, and hearing you explain it helps me feel more comfortable and justified with my own transition. Thank you.
I watched this video when it first came out but I keep thinking about it and I just realized that not only is this "autogynephilia" crap very transphobic (duh), but it's also pretty misoginystic because it assumes that the only reason someone could want a "female" body is for some sexual fantasy --> the only purpose of the "female" body is for sex.
Great video, thank you for sharing your story. You are beautiful.
Listening to contrapoints explain herself I just got this intense feeling of "Oh this... this sounds like me. A lot like me." I abandoned the idea of being trans a long time ago because I thought I didn't have /dysphoria/ but prided myself on being a twink and was  distraught about growing chest hair because I thought people wouldn't be attracted to me if I weren't twinky enough. In retrospect it was more dysphoria than anything else, I guess, and my fear of transitioning because of social acceptance doesn't change how I feel about myself.
The bar is so low for cis white men YouTube philosopher-idiots ala Sam Harris, Jordan Petersen, Ben shapiro, Rogan, etc.  What's more pathetic is how much they bash trans folks, one of which is proving to be the most rigorous YouTube philosopher around. One that actually cross references research from a range of thinkers and seeks to make a better world.  Thanks Natalie!
Could you do a response to Is Liberalism Fascism?, or anything else from Scotch Oikos? He is a smug centrist that just shits on Leftism. https://youtu.be/3XtmbS9c6YU
how did i just find this channel
I've watched your channel every now and then for the last couple of years and I really like your content, I think this is the first video I've watched since you formally came out as trans. As a fellow trans woman I loved this video, but my biggest takeaway is that I wish I could just give you a big hug and show you my solidarity. Keep shining.
Omg thanks for taking one for the team. I honestly think you're a video making genius. This'll probably come in handy for a lot of people dealing with "maybe they're actually right about me" kind of fears
But what does it really MEAN to be trans?
the look @14:15  lmao >_<!  Another great essay/episode. Keep up the awesome content!
*sudden realization that you have merch* well, I know where all of my extra income will go for a good while. May my purchases 5 minutes ago and my patronage help you fund your collection of costumes and ornaments which I am totally not jealous of.
Dude as a cis male this really opened a window in woman sexuality.
I can't believe you made a whole video without an ironic hallucinatory nightmare
The part addressing 50SoG is so funny
<3
Ridiculous how much praise this got haha. No wonder transidentifying males are so delusional.  Your examples of "Fake greek terms" are all people who like their own bodies. You do not get turned on by your own body, you hate your own body: you get turned on by a body you bought, and worse, you demand that your purchase actually makes you a woman. You are completely the opposite of all of your examples. The fact that you can't see buying the female form in any way related to your sexual desires is objectifying to women, and you've made a serious video that so many praised where you sometimes seriously just refuted with "That doesnt make sense"... really speaks to what a Men's Sexual Rights movement transideology is.
My gf likes to put makeup on me but I'm just so goddang lazy. Too much time and work for my lazy ass
Wow.  I haven't read any of this stuff.  Despite having read many books this is one I think I'll skip.  This all sounds made up and a bit obnoxious.   More of an excuse to push transwomen and women in general into prostitution and "male ego" trying to harm women.  Not that I think much of any of the theories regarding transgenderism anyway but it's too complicated to be correct.  Truth is usually hard to understand but surprisingly boring.  If it's not elegant then it's not an explanation, especially when it comes to complex problems.
When you read some of "The Man Who Would Be Queen," I seriously thought he was a weeb who loves Traps for a sec.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAAA TRIGGER WARNINGS N SHIET. OML I LAUGHED UNTIL I FELT SAD ABOUT BEING IN THE SAME GENUS AS YOU AND THEN CRINGED
im a transman and i used to sleep in a bra because it made it a LOT easier for me to ignore my chest... the feeling of them being all loose and flopping around was just... i literally could not stand it
Ughh, I love this channel now ... You win contra .. You win
content warning, omg, i didnt dare to watch futher, omg  but i did anyway    ok, you say like, im not a twisted pervert, like in the horrormovie  the thing is, what is twisted about being an autogynephelic ?  (sounds like nephilim hahhaha, you know, fields of the nephilim )   when im a dude, which i am, wear dresses, and it turns me on, wtf is 'perverted' about that ? Thats a jugement you made up, channeled through christian values.  yes, the men in the movie is nasty, but thats a movie. A men in real life, wearing the dresses etc, wtf is wrong with that, who cares ? We all have our edges etc   and how is it 'phobic' again  nobody fears anything about this issue
So youtube has been autoplaying your videos at me for the past couple hours and I am thoroughly entertained (and I probably learned a couple things)  One thing I realize, is that this constitute exposure to a transperson. Something that has always been an hypothetical situation to me.  I am not yet sure how I feel exactly. While I know you are male, I cannot help but perceive you differently as you philosophize at me in various degrees of femininity (youtube didn't care to play vids in chronological order).   I feel like I am watching one of those visual illusion images that can be perceived two ways. Like the vase & two faces. Sometimes you are man, sometime you are woman, often you are charming. The confusion is deliciously expanded in multiple personalities videos like "The Left".  What a delightful experience, thank you.
Background painted paper shows a koala from hell. Cannot unsee.
What I think I like about your videos most is the depth in your agreement. You use both subjective and objective points without over doing either or. Thanks for your channel 😊
As someone who has certain issues with the modern state of social progressivism, Contrapoints is great. I wish there were more people like her. Quick to battle ideas with logic and reason, rather than to fight people with fists and accusations of bigotry.
I haven't kept up with you for a couple months so your voice threw me off biiiig time at first but it's great to see that you're transitioning comfortably and you're having a lot of success.
@40:30 Do you think the FemFreq running gag has run its course? At first it seemed a great way to make light of anti-feminists who make her out to be a dark lord corrupting the minds naive feminists. Now it just seems to be a joke at her expense since she isn’t a hot topic anymore.
😂😂 These people
You are fucking entertaining to watch, Contrapoints! Not because I agree with you, but for the unironical ragefest you release. Please keep up doing the great work!
Really interesting video and I'm yet again blown away by your artistry in your videos. Keep it up. :)
Non-binary critical theorist coming through XD Is there any way you would be interested in doing videos explaining basic political philosophy for us undergrad plebs? I have been having a hell of a time defending postmodernism, and I feel that you would be able to do a killer job at walking people through it, just as an example.
you need to wake up Autogynephilia is real and very relatable to a post-op trans woman such as myself..it makes perfect sense..Its actually a cool queer mindfuck that I love..drop the dinky music, rubber dinosaurs and candles that make you look like a killjoy witch...trans has many angles Autogynephilia is one..but then again he/she bitches like you love shouting down opinions that make sense..cant take you seriously
Dropping some serious redpills there around that 50 Shades bit.
This channel comes off as a teen who likes to play dress up, have memorised a lot of long syllable words & radom facts. Then trying to pass that combination off as intelligence.  I mean I don´t necessasarily disagree with the points that he/she/it/them/rainbow-unicorn here are making. Still the presentation is just so juvenile & pretentious, that it is like watching someone trying to stick their head up their own ass & being happy that they succeeded
P E A K  T R A N S
but does it exist?    and all the animals that people love so much for "naturally transitioning" do it for sexual reproduction reasons. they switch from being sperm makers to egg makers. but that doesn't mean we call egg making fish female right? they are still men fish right?  your description of identidy is somewhere on deviant art or tumblr. some kind of demisexual... what do you mean sexualy behaving like a female woman lady? Orientations but autosexual is an orientation. this is an orientation.  oh my god. what kind of social justice warrior are you. you can't be trans and not support every hair brained orientation and gender. if tumblr and deviant art users say it is true it is true  i don't like my body  that cosmo thing makes me feel not good. broken, scandalized, angry  what should we call it when you dream you turn into other gender/sex and have sexual attraction only in dreams. that is a real true valid orientation right?  yes, it is wrong to want people to find you sexy and have sex with you. other people don't exist for your sexual pleasure
Testosterone to blame. How terribly reductionist & biological eh Nicky?
Contra you are beautiful and intelligent! I loved this video and learned a lot. And as a cis woman I think you did a pretty good job of explaining how we typically experience sexuality.  It is about being wanted. Masturbation usually doesn't even feel like a lustful activity....just a relaxing one to help sleep or get rid of cramps during menstruation.
dude, quit the KoolAid; you'll never be a woman
SHE-FAGGGGG.
Nat, you're the best. I missed you.
Born a woman, sleep in a bra every night. Gotta keep my titties under control.
Next on Gamranx
What’s the opera song at the beginning called?
Your  description of your experience of sexuality during/post hormones is actually really reflective of mine, a bisexual cis woman. After I came out, I had a hard time justifying my bi-ness to myself, as my sexual feelings towards women weren't in line with how I understood those of men (which I realize is a weird expectation). In addition you a really great video, you  actually helped me put my own sexuality into words, and for that I am grateful.
I'm a cis woman and I wear a bra to bed almost every night lol
The "exotic" thing and then mentioning she isn't born in America is so fucking cringy. Who woulda thunk transphobes are the same creeps who who treat foreign women as "exotic" rather than like any other woman.
Another well done video. Thanks for being open and honest and refuting a bad hypothesis.
Great production, as always, but be careful if you're hanging out with Peter Coffin. That guy has a pretty sketchy past.
Above and beyond. Maybe, just maybe, you did this so nobody else would have to.
I love your videos, contra.  Please, upload the full song of the timewarp
Oh Contra, you're amazing!! Thank you for making and sharing this deeply personal and well researched/written video. I will definitely share it with others - as well as feel more comfortable talking about it, your perfect blend of entertaining and educational makes a difficult topic like this feel way more approachable.
This was really dense and eye opening. Thanks a lot for your huge work. And also, totally rude and unrelated, yeah, you're hot. This is purely egotistic but I had to say it.
fyi I have known a very busty cis lady to sleep in a bra (possibly multiple bras?!) to alleviate back pain.
Your analysis, acting, singing, and piano are all so on in this video!
Contra, you have no idea what you've done for me.  This was so powerful and amazing to watch as a trans woman.  Thank you <3
If it makes you feel better Contra, I (a cis woman) sleep with the bra on.  IDK why I'm just unconfortable otherwise. I can't be the only one.
Just wanted to say I started watching your video's yesterday and love them, My favorite bits are when you do something ridiculous and curse in your male toned voice, so hilarious. I also love how informative your video's are, keep doing great work!
Who says that cis women don't wear fishnets, garter belts, and corsets?
God, the voice for Blanchard sounds like Zap Brannigan from Futurama, and now I can't unsee it.
Dang very interesting video, given me a lot to think about. I knew hormones were powerful, but didnt think they could have such a profound impact in the types of desires one has...
Feminine Essence sounds like Plato's theory of forms to me.
I'm sorry I called you an autogynephile. You made a convincing case.
from my perspective at least you got the description of female sexuality down pat. Your content is amazing and your takes are hot. keep on rockin
Wow! You are a film maker. Fantastic.
I couldn't think of a more appropriate place to ask this question (as your channel comments are empty) and this may never be seen, but I would like to ask you this...  Would you consider featuring this track https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2QE_ryswh4 as part of a live stream and maybe look for other Soviet electronica tracks.  I mean, yeah, I'm an arsehole and yeah, it's a Soviet keep fit record but you do have a lot of Soviet fans so maybe some Cold War era Eastern European synth tunes *C O M M U N I S T W A V E* tracks might be welcome.
incredible video, absolutely incredible. never ever stop
I'm a straight cis Black Male and I got more out of this video than a lot of others that are designed to speak to me directly.
Thank you for sharing this, I am sure that it was very difficult.
Contra calls that shitty book bad but well written which makes it all the more dangerous but that excerpt is just straight up shitty. Who could take that seriously as even a pop-science text?!
Sex Pervert!
'I've dated a lot of cis women in the past. I know what they do.' The confidence while saying that, tho. Where were my panties, again? Being a Contraphile is so harsh.
I think you do a great job of capturing the essence of freedom. Including the freedom to be confused about the future outcome of choices, freedom to make errors (or decision you later regret), to question things that prove to hold up and not change under questioning (wasting your time, but out of choice).  And I think you hold the weight of the world on your shoulders for freedom - and clearly self-identify with your talent and ability to communicate - as you should. You do seem to have an ability to put topics on the table in an organized and clear fashion where others lack that talent or cognitive ability.  I don't think it is painless or easy to care for strangers and their freedom against the machinery attitudes of society.  I think you have shown a consistent pattern of tugging on strings of personal freedom, individual vs. monolithic system, and the right to be given the respect for making those personal choices (for all people, not just your own self).
I love you. Thank you for sharing this and all the emotional energy you clearly put into your videos. I'm a cis woman ??? or non binary ???? person ??? but a shit ton of what you say about your experience of womanhood resonates in a way that nothing else really ever has for me. Thanks for helping me feel like I'm not alone in the things that I don't say out loud to people or even to myself.
Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. 
I hope this isn't an insult to you but you look like wynona rider and i absolutely love it ,she's one of my favorite actresses . i'm getting a girl crush from it
"What do cis women want to have sex as, walruses??" I laughed a little too hard
You are a Queen Natalie
Thanks for a great video!😊
incredible, you talk about something so personal to thousands of random strangers while i could not tell my real feelings and experieces to anyone.
Amazing video!  If I may, though; Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs is often brought up as a negative portrayal of trans individuals. In the text itself, however, both Clarice AND Hannibal assert that Bill is NOT trans. Bill is someone with a severe personality disorder and he has tried MULTIPLE different personas in order to feel "whole". We even see in his home that he went through a Nazi period of his life.   The reason we meet him at the time we do, ie, when he is attempting to become a woman, is to serve the larger themes of the text. Ie, the abuse and co-opting of female identity by men. I'm s big fan of Silence, and think that one element gets a bad wrap when the film itself isn't making any kind of assertions about trans identity.
You are so brave for talking about this!! So eye-opening for someone like me! You have no idea how much I appreciated this video. You are so amazing! Keep up the great work!
Wow! Your story of transitioning later in life is similar to mine (I'm 36 and seeking transition) also for similar reasons. I grew up male (ish). I was always very effeminate and when I started to see that age was going to make me a goddam man, I totally freaked out. It is SO nice to hear a story of transition like this. I haven't heard any others like this and it makes me feel less like a fraud. Xxx
Cool video dude.
❤
Cher sounds AMAZING! tell me more!
while i don't prescribe specifically to the "soul of a gender", I had thought i understood from the several hormonal washes that happen in utero is what could lead to the "mix up" from the heteronormative( sorry better term escapes me). Where there is argument that this process can affect orientation, i don't think it'd be a far stretch to argue this is where sense of self as gender could also work. (take this with grain of salt cuz i haven't studied in loooong time),  I don't know if this makes it the Biological version of the same theory or not
Natalie just donated her heart to science. Respect.
Through hate-reading TERF blogs. I've noticed that they seem to have come up with a similar dichotomy for trans men where trans men who are attracted to women are just  r e p r e s s e d  butch lesbians (literally just a gender swapped version of the "homosexual transsexual") and trans men who are attracted to men are just straight girls who fetishize gay men.
Its amazing being pretty much on the right side, but purely through luck, rather than research leading me to come to the conclusion independently, but Bailey sounds like a terrible researcher, like he knows in his heart there is no such thing as Transgender people, then spends all this time trying to prove it badly.
Very interesting video. Thank you, Natalie.
This video made me uncomfortable, you have made something really great. I cant really articulate my feelings beyond that, but please keep up the good work. Much appreciated.
"The notion of the vanity of women is a misogynistic trope that originates in male projection. It is the assumption that women enjoy looking at themselves in the same way that men enjoy looking at them and are hence complicit in their objectification".   I really appreciated this after the segment on autogynephilia in cis women. It's undeniable that a significant portion of cis women are autogynephilic but it's difficult to know what percentage of that phenomenon is socialized, in a male-dominated culture that glorifies female beauty and denies the existence of male beauty - or at least doesn't offer intentional depictions of it, while bombarding us with "the female form" throughout our lives. In a world where men's subjective feelings towards women were not transformed into objective truths and applied to all people, perhaps more women could experience their attraction to men in a genuine way. Women who experience attraction as agents rather than objects, lovers rather than beloveds, might be less bullied by society - which labels them desperate, clingy, bossy, or thirsty ridiculous sluts for externally directing sexual/romantic attraction.  In this same vein, it's a misinterpretation of women's erotica to say female sexuality is not "wanting" but "being wanted". Sometimes this can be true - it's true for you, and it's true for some women I know. But it's not true for most women. (Women thirst. Oh, they thirst.) You're right that female attraction is generally less visual, but women are still powerfully attracted to men - as people. As a whole package. As an id/ego/superego, a story in the making, a soul with vulnerabilities, a singularity of nature and aesthetics manifested as a man or whoever. (Yes, this is sexual. Yes, it will give you orgasms.) That's why written erotica works better than pictures. Writing gives you all the little details and behaviors that make up a human. In this way I would actually say that women are *more* attracted to men than men are to women. Maybe you will experience this kind of attraction someday because of your hormones.   More likely, receptivity is an *acceptable* expression of female sexuality. That's why Fifty Shades of Grey, and other erotic works with passive female heroes, are so successful. Not because they reflect pure, condensed female sexuality, but because they allow a massive number of women to experience erotic fantasy while safe from internal shame. Whenever the woman's responsibility for a sexual/romantic encounter is lessened, the self-image of a voracious domineering slutwhore (which is a massive turn-off) is less likely to emerge. Anastasia's modesty/timidness gives the reader permission to enjoy the beautiful, mysterious, masculine character of Christian Grey. Yes, she is a self-insert - because she serves the same role as Harry Potter or Frodo Baggins. She lets the reader enter the the fantastical kinky luxurious darkly masculine world they want to enter and transmits it through a perspective that is comprehensible to them. And Christian's love for Anastasia isn't necessarily appealing to the reader because they want that attraction to be directed at themselves - it's because women are attracted *to passion itself*. First of all, raw emotional displays test and expose someone's core personality; emotional extremes let women "see" the true, hidden soul of a person, which is their greatest object of attraction. And secondly, desperate, intense romantic-sexual arousal is often the most physically pleasurable form of arousal for women. Sure, some women want to be loved intensely. But many women love to feel intense love themselves, and their attraction to Christian is tied up in their empathy with him. (If they're demisexual, empathizing with Christian's intense love may allow them to feel any arousal at all.) For some women it's both. For some women it's neither, and they just enjoy witnessing the spectacle of intense sexual love.  It might seem like a leap to imply that womens' shame has such a powerful effect on their ability to become aroused, and on such a massive scale. But it's really similar to how gender dysphoria inhibits authentic sexual experience and connection. There's science supporting the premise that women feel more guilt than men and are reflexively shame-adverse. That's part of the appeal of women being submissive in BDSM or other kink. Even when it seems like all the attention is focused on the woman's body, she is usually focused on her partner too and actively wants him - but whatever aspects of the fantasy work for her let her lose her self-regulation and/or self-image and get lost in desire and sensation.   You're right that vanity is a misogynistic trope. However, it's not the worst misogynistic trope, by far. Many women who live out the "vain" stereotype are still popular, sexually satisfied, and socially fine. There's something way bigger, and girls meet it at young age - when they have their first crush or kiss, or fall in love for the first time, or make a move on someone. When they begin to express the human passion that fascinates them... they immediately begin encountering repulsed reactions from peers. When a boy has an unrequited crush on a girl, it's ~sweet and a ~rite of passage, but when a girl has an unrequited crush, we assume there's something wrong with her; plus, she's too emotional or sexual. Experiencing that around puberty is social and mental torment and it's psychologically crushing. I imagine that, after going through that once, most girls immediately retreat within themselves. They direct their energies towards looking as pretty and normal as possible in hopes that a boy will come to them.   The repulsive mental horror image of an ugly, dominant, sexual woman is one which I can't exactly put into words but it's the one that most negatively compels girls, from a young age. And it's not just about patriarchal propaganda. Most people who abuse/maltreat children are actually women (because most child caretakers are women). So the "mental image of an ugly, dominant, sexual woman" seems to be a bogeyman for everything that enrages straight men, and everything that terrifies and repulses young straight girls who grow up around abusive and boundary-invading maternal and older female figures. Avoiding being *that* may guide girls' entire lives.  But, come to think of it, you probably feel something very similar. Maybe transmisogyny is largely based on trans women being put into the same bogeyman trope. Anyway I know you are very busy and probably won't read this, if you have actually read it, thank you so much?? And I hope these ideas are useful.
You’re reaching so hard here. It’s a fucking fetish, nothing more.
It looks really painful, the way you try and speak in that awful high pitched nasally voice. It’s frustrating. Just talk in your normal voice like buffalo Bill does ;-)
Most "sex researchers" come from fields like psychology. Psychology is not a science.
Did not expect the Lionel Richie, but was not disappointed :)
Thank you for making this
wow, this was really really really good. I hope you get hit up by so many other trans women so you can get fucked, gl friend.
the cumlative effects of testosterone on my body were definitely what triggered my dysphoria to intensify as well. I was always very effiminate and feminine looking and the thought of losing that terrified me.
thank you
Of course, us bi trans women, or the homosexual autogynophiles, are uh... wait, what are we
This may sound weird, but you have realllly nice lips.
You give so much <3
This video is so fucking amazing Oo  Incredible job, so many things to think after seeing this vidéo... Really, thanks you.
I love this video so much.
As a self professed TERF I love your channel and content. I know, strange.
I am so in love with how much happier you are. The smile before the fade to black and the laughs right before a cut are a you we didn't really see on this channel before your transition. And that's all on top of how funny, engaging, thorough and focused your content is. And even that's on top of what feels crass to say is your 'production value', it's your own unique craft and I love to see the joy you take in perfecting, and maybe more importantly, playing with it.   I'll admit that when I saw a 49 minute video on a word I didn't know, I was hesitant to click. It took me a couple of days to actually set aside time and dedicate myself to the altar of Contrapoints. Now this is all I want to talk about. I will not stop preaching the good news of Contra. I'm really not sure how ironic I'm being here. The religious imagery I just used might be *problematic*.
That slow mo "trans activists" had me rolling. Amazing video!
Amazing video. Thank you for sharing yourself with us in such entertaining ways as usual. And side note- while trans women have undoubtedly been the main targets of these theories, there is also autoandrophilia in the DSM that is used against both trans men and butch cis women or even any cis women who use strap ons at all. The paraphilia section is a joke with the few exceptions of paraphilia that actually cause harm (flashers, etc.)
No reluctancy to admitting that I take sexual interest in my own body @ all: I jerked off in the mirror last night.
Please do a recreation of Rocky Horror as a one-woman show where you play every single character because I didn't know I needed it so badly until RIGHT THIS INSTANT.
thank god for this video. the internets swirling vortex of transmysoginy threatens even my own integrity as a trans person thinking about other trans people with its never ending parade of confusing straw manning, sockpuppets, and being downright deceitful. what you’re doing is a civil service.
Wait, people don't like their own body odor? I fucking love not showering so I can smell myself. But, whatever.  Either way, your videos are always great, but this one is especially enlightening, interesting, and fantastic.  I would, however, like to hear your thoughts on J Peterson. I'm a totally fanboy (maybe I should start saying fanman?) for him. Most people who criticize him, I have absolutely no respect for, so hearing about your disagreements with him would be great and I'd love to hear your opinion.
Great video overall, but i have a couple of points of contention. You say that generalization is unfair  (even have a paranthetical disclaimer about it) and then proceed to generalize the shit out of cis male/female sexuality. The plural of anecdote is not data, and you outlined standards for these two groups based largely on anecdote, while the actual study that you later cite seems to contradict some of those earlier generalizations. I feel that you also downplay/outright ignore the role of socialization (and patriarchy) in shaping personal sexual expression. It's not solely about hormones.  It also rubbed me the wrong way when you dismissed the TERF's legitimate lived experiences of oppression as a cis woman by calling her a "fucking asshole". It's one of the few intersectional issues i feel has not been given its due reconciliation. It seems like both sides are uneasy about tackling it, for fairly obvious reasons. The TERF *is* an asshole, but the use of that particular issue to belittle and shame her read as tone deaf. (For the record, i am not a TERF. I believe strongly that trans women are women and belong in feminist spaces.)  This was a very informative and well-thought-out video, as always!
Sigh.... alone in the void.
Arrgggghhhh screaming into the abyss of youtube... trans haters and other complex bullying is getting me way down.... Thinking getting difficult... dissociating seems very appealing...
This is richly ironic since your perversion is so clearly and obviously driven by autogynephilia.  The fact that you and others like you are unaware of it, that you really believe you're women, is irrelevant.  Mentally ill people are not good at self-awareness, so they're not very good at judging their own motivations.
@contrapoints Great video! Since you flashed him in the video I got courius (given how hot the topic's been since the channel 4 news interview) What are your thoughts on Jordan Petersen and his opposition to laws that require people to refer to people by their preferred pronouns?  Best regards from one of your followers/ an aspiring Opera Singer
This is a spectacular video, and I couldn't help but watch till the end.
Can TERFs please fling themselves into the sun?
Write. a. book.
I feel sorry about this having to happen
exceptional, your best yet, etc. thank you for being so open about your experience
Excellent as usual
this video is amazing. i am a cis woman, and I just fucking loved it. you nailed it. god damn.
I feel like I really missed out on Rocky Horror Picture Show by growing up in the Netherlands, I've only ever seen it referenced but never on its own. Great vid as always Nat!
I'm sure it isn't an original thought, but what I love most about your videos are the conversations between your three "characters". It recalls one of the few philosophy books that I've actually read all the way through, "Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion" by Hume. It's incredible to see a well done modern interpretation of that method.  Also, you are amazing, don't ever stop.
It's good to see another trans musician out there!
No notes except to say that I loved it and (long overdue) have become a Patron!
Killed it again! Great vid contra love you
I remember when I first found your channel...almost a year ago now. I fell in love with the Frank N Furter aesthetic and subbed right away. <3 Who wouldn't love you?!
finally set aside a chunk of time to watch this. it's amazing work, truly.
Your analysis of Fifty Shades of Grey sounds a lot like the r/theredpill view of female sexuality, that women are mainly interested in alpha males. Yet you're opposed to advising men to become alpha males. Does that mean you are opposed to men becoming sexually attractive?
just a heads up, your "Free Speech (Part 1)" video link in your description leads to the christopher hitchens video, not your video!
This is brilliant! Please make a video on Jordan Peterson, he is such a hack
Oh my god thank you We need more rational analysis of trans “philosophy”  This is wonderful
Cher sounds awesome. And man, I want to do voice overs too!
The thing I love about your channel is how you properly represent the opposing argument. As someone who isn't extensively informed, I'm able to tell that the argument is wrong, but it's always difficult to put into words; and that's where the magic comes in, breaking every piece down into their related portions and addressing them with equal value, which helps it to 'click' in my mind even if I'm not as smart as you because you've left no room for confusion. So fucking refreshing, thank you for your confidence and for your voice.
I know cis women who get of to there own tits
i like ur earings
It’s for horseback riding XD omg
My wife wanted me to comment that she wore her bra to bed for years and only stopped recently. She’s a cis female. Also I loved the video Natalie! Keep fighting the good fight!
This has to be one of the most interesting and informative videos I've ever watched on the topic of gender and sexuality. Well done Contra, absolutely brilliant!
it's time to cum
There are a lot of hateful groups out here, like Transgender Trend https://www.transgendertrend.com/born-in-your-own-body-new-book-transgender-children/ very disgusting errors of thought. They're gaining acceptance because people are learning about Trans issues while they spread their misinformation. What's to be done?
Name of the piece starting at 31.30?
This is a really really good video, thank you so much for posting this, I can't imagine how scary it must be to bare your soul like this for the internet. This video is super educational, and I hate to nitpick (if that is what i'm about to do) but the one thing that bothered me about this video was what came across to me as a sort of appeal to respectability that could end up harming/alienating other trans people.   The idea that you're a woman because you don't have paraphilias, don't dress in corsets, don't value orgasms, take estrogen, and don't experience sexual attraction based on physical lust (or at least physical lust alone) all seem to toss women who don't live up to those standards (standards put in place by transphobes, no less) to the wayside.   In my eyes a woman (trans or cis) who has paraphilias, or who dresses in corsets, fishnets, etc, or who has high testosterone (whether cis or trans, because of course there are plenty of cis women with high testosterone) still experiences true female sexuality, and is of course, still a woman.  to deny that to me is to acknowledge that our transphobic/transmisogynist society gets to decide who is and isn't ~truly trans~. Not that you called women who do have those qualities not actually women, but you seemed to frame your own womanhood as real because you don't do those things.   Really though this video is wonderful and educating, and I learned a lot from it! I hope this doesn't come across as me saying the video was bad or anything because honest to god I thought it was perf otherwise <3  Edit: I just wanted to add that as a trans person I really empathize with the desire to prove the validity of my gender to others, btw. It's so fucking tough and you're amazing for doing this so publicly, I can't imagine how tough it must be, and I really admire you for that!
You're beautiful and funny and so very brave.
The name of the opera song in the beginning is "Myself I shall Adore", from Handel's Semele. Took me 3 hours to figure it out. I kept trying to interpret it as German words. Turns out it's in English.
I came with a top of preconception and left quite informed after this video .
the lady doth protest....do u boo.
👏👏👏👏
For what it's worth, I not only find you passing (not that it matters) but in my eyes you are an attractive woman. Don't be hard on yourself.
Really fascinating video. I do enjoy how you circle back occasionally to your older videos and demonstrate how your experiences and views evolve over time.
Trans people identify with a gender different from the one assigned at birth based on sexual organs. People who like drag dress as the opposite gender for fun and artistic expression. And finally, some people just like to jerk off while wearing lacy panties. All of these people exist AND it's possible to be more than one of these at the same time. As for who people date, that's their sexuality, and I don't think being trans or cis has anything to do with being gay or straight. Everyone needs to stop trying to put people they don't know into little boxes and stop assuming anyone who behaves differently is "bad" or "wrong" in some way (this goes for cis people denying trans people rights, and trans activists getting bent out shape over drag performers as if they own the concept of gender expression).
I appreciated the Pirates reference.  Well done.  And thank you for what you do.
Nat, this was one of your best ones yet: Even though I, a mortal soul, did not quite get all of the terminology the in the first viewing, the material was so well thought out and plainly quite worth the wait. Thank you, for continually helping me turn away from the darkness, and face the light ;-)
“Maybe I’m just a woman who wants someone to fuck me every once in awhile,” very relatable. All jokes aside though as a cis woman bisexual a lot of how you describe your sexuality and how you approach attraction after your transition seems familiar to my experience of how I conceive of attraction and desire.
Contra looking prettier and prettier. :^)
As a straight cis dude, the coolest thing about this was the deep insight it offered into perspectives I can never personally understand. Thanks Contra!
Brave, smart, funny.
Wait... you believe in the soul?
I absolutely love this video. Thank you for addressing this subject, especially in such a personal way - it really does need to be talked about and you did a fantastic job (as usual). I never thought about autogynephelia in cis women and I'm now having an internal crisis about anatomical autogynephelia and being an AFAB genderqueer. Thanks for that.  This video was posted literally as I was finishing my final edit on a blog post about the hyper feminization and assumed heterosexuality of trans women that directly addresses autogynephilia. I had to insert a link to it in my post (for my meager audience of, like, 4... I try) since it was so relevant and also well done. I'll link to the post here, half as a shameless plug for a new SJW gender blog and half as proof of a total twilight zone moment.   https://rowynnblair.com/2018/02/02/hyper-femininity-and-assumed-heterosexuality-of-trans-women/
Thanks heaps for this, Contra.
Hey, I stumbled across your channel a while back and have become a huge fan. Your videos just keep getting better. One thing I noticed due to the length of the video is the lighting. I FUCKING LOVE THE LIGHTING. Anyway, please always stay awesome! And you ARE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN! INSIDE AND OUT!
this is so fucking brave, thank you for being so vulnerable and patient with the world <3
Curious question, whats your opinion on Donald Trump? I personally thought he was awesome until he did a bunch of bullshit moves.
love Rocky Horror my favorite movie!
THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPENESS AND HONESTY.yOU ARE VERY BRAVE.
37:42  "This video's too long; I'm getting cranky!"  I'm rolling on the floor right now! xD
Wow. Amazing...  Especially the part where you're talking about your history, this could've literally be me, right up to the point where I spent my twenties being rather androgynous and where my dysphoria was primarily triggered by the realization in my early thirties that I would end up aging into the body of an old man.
I regret that all I have to give is my thumbs up
I really learn a lot about my gender every day and it's all thanks to your content. I didn't even knows I was going through gender dysphoria till I started watching your videos and watching your videos has really helped to relieve it. Thank you for your honesty, you're my hero and I want to be more like you some day
I don't know how to avoid sounding like just another fan girl in the internet, but I've honestly been obsessed with your videos for the past month and I really appreciate your presence and your content and I LOVE YOUUUUU!
Great improvement in this video, keep it up, but a bit faster please.
Thank you for making this.
I miss Pepe
Wow, this video fucked me up in the best possible way. I've been IDing as genderqueer for a bit and feeling more and more like a woman, but... well, I'll save you the 10 paragraphs and just say there was a LOT I related to and felt validated by in this video, and also appreciated where you made room for the variety in experiences where ours didn't match up. Anyway yesterday I found myself waking up at 3pm and finally told someone (my gf) for the first time, out loud, I want to transition. I'm a woman. Whelp, anyway, also thought I'd throw out there that you're hilarious and I always look forward to the new videos. Thanks a bunch.
You are criminally under-appreciated and your channel is a fucking gift to humanity. I can't find the words to describe the importance of your videos, but just know that this person really appreciates what you're doing.
Normally I enjoy your videos immensely, but this was so close to my own personal experience as a trans-woman that I basically just cried my way through it - in a good way! Thank you so much for making this, I cannot express how validating I found it <3
Maybe his theory would have had more credence if he hadn't focused on the sexual perversion aspect so much. Human beings are motivated by more than just their sexual urges. Maybe there are people who like seeing themselves as women in a sexual way as well as a whole host of other ways that aren't sexual. Additionally, I would argue that cis-women are autogynophiles as well. How could they not be? Being socialised in a culture which objectifies every part of the female body would ensure it, not to mention the fact that the male gaze teaches female viewers how to appreciate the female aesthetics.
Thank you so much!!! I’ve wanted to get what your saying out there and into the heads of all my classmates for too long now!!! I’m a trans girl currently going to a gender clinic to eventually get oestrogen and blockers and it’s hard and nasty and dysphoria and anxiety and ehhhhhhhhhhh..... but I anyway thank you so so so so so much for this video!! Thank you for being the voice i wish I had!!! Thank you for making me feel normal!!! Thank you for being you thank you for being contrapoints!!! Love ya!!! 💖
Girl this is just incredible like the writing and editing is so funny
Great video as always, but I do have one complaint. You seem to not have done your research on the feminine essence theory. Because, the spiritual nonsense aside, it's almost certainly true. You really were born a woman and will be a woman your entire life, same as every other trans woman (and every cis woman). This is based on a few avenues of research:  1. Brain scans and dissections of trans people consistently show that their brains are more similar to the brains of cis people of their gender than to the brains of cis people of their sex. Furthermore, this is true before transition and is not changed by transition. This is strong evidence for gender being biological and determined by the physical structure of the brain. 2. Twin studies overwhelmingly point to a strong genetic cause for gender incongruence. On top of that studies on gender formation in general point to gender being determined before birth, most likely by prenatal sex hormone exposure. So it's quite likely that all transgender people are born transgender. 3. Attempts to raise children with a different gender to the one they were born with consistently fail, pointing to socialization not being a part of gender formation. This also means gender is resistant to change during adolescence. 4. Many transgender people experience gender dysphoria to the point that they're desperate to transition. A process which is likely to cause them no small amount of suffering and hardship. That going through great pains to change one's body is seen as the only way to alleviate dysphoria means that the other route to congruence, changing one's gender, is a non-option. This points to gender being persistent and non-malleable during adulthood.  Combine all that and you get transgender people being born transgender and remaining transgender their entire lives with no known way to change that.
Very thought provoking. Makes me wonder about female sexuality more broadly. I consider myself straight but I do find the female form (and myself) attractive. Also I love the colorful lighting of Contra's videos.
<3
Heres the fuck saw article if anyone's looking https://jezebel.com/5775675/professor-shows-class-orgasm-demo-unsurprising-fallout-ensues  He sounds like an absolute mess of a person that's somehow barged his way into a position of power by being louder and edgier than everyone else
thank you for doing this i found some of this very interesting.  those who come out later in life may not come out in years past the clarke had a policy under zucker which was very negative toward children being themselves for many i took time before they could be themselves.    I am 50 i knew who i was when i was 10 (1977) i knew no one like me at 15 (1983) zucker and his people decided i needed to be cured.  i am better now i took may years before i could deal what they did to me.  i started to transition 5 years ago i have never felt better my life is so much better .  these old doctors are some of the most fucked up people i have ever read about.  these doctor knew next to nothing about makes trans women tick
dude the lighting in this video is fucking fantastic
Some people are just a mystery to me, how on earth can someone conclude narcissism from the desire to be *someone else*?  If someone says they want to be someone else, that is pretty much the OPPOSITE OF NARCISSISM.  Narcissism is when you already think you are beautiful, transgenderism is when you WANT to be beautiful, or at least to LOOK DIFFERENT, it's the OPPOSITE OF NARCISSISM.
37:41 I find it appropriate that you're pouring yourself a glass of *Bailey*'s there.
Wow it is really brave to talk about such personal things to help others. Respect that. Also she is really pretty.
Blanchard actually did invent autoandrophilia. However he has gone on the record as saying that he thinks it isn't real and that he only did that so that people wouldn't accuse him of homophobic bias by focusing only on AMAB folks.
I don't think you can use the stuff Nietzsche wrote about women as an argument that science priviliges the male lense. Even this guy, I mean there's no way that he is accepted by any sophisticated scientist. This is not science. Biology is science, which by the way is not much appreciated by you postmodernists.
another incredible video! thanks for doing this, i know it must be really difficult to disclose so much personal information.
Your a treasure.... A FUCKING TREASURE!!
Good video, way to point out the logical fallacies of AGP and bring light on an emotionally polarizing subject. I believe at the root of the AGP theory is a sexually immature toxically masculine world view of women as the "lesser sex". There-fore- the only reason a "male" would be a "women" is because of a dysfunctional paraphelia, because why else would a "male" emasculinate themselves!!!? God for bid....
Is it abnormal for strait CIS men to feel like they would prefer women to physically lust after them in the same way men typically do?
This is a truly amazing video, Natalie! When I found your channel I thought your videos couldn't get better, but oh how wrong I was. You are progressing with every video, as a [person who explains stuff to a broad audience in a fun and compelling way] and also as an artist. Your work is so impressive I just don't know how to express it!  (But also once again i do find your descriptions of your own past experience kind of unsetteling. I do resonate with them more than I wish I would. It is confusing, kind of scary even. Nevermind) Thank you for your work!
thanks for the video dear human.   the evanesance burn in lyfe tho
I love everything about this video.
Made the mistake if checking out the  /r/GenderCritical subreddit, the lowest of the low and I've had my fair share of race realists and supremacists
What about the theory that you "cluster B" mtf transition purposely or subconsciously to insult and rebel against your parent, particularly your mom, whom you have deep hatred toward for screwing up your early life. You eventually perceived her as powerless to have done "better" at raising you, so decide to abdicate responsibility for some part of your adult life by becoming femininely passive, like her, and to spite her.
Just wanted to let you know that, as a recently out trans chick from the UK, and someone who intends to try to straddle being an activist and an academic in future (yaaayyyy) and thus someone who has been doing a lot of reading about this sort of thing recently... Far from condemning this video, I want you to know that this is possibly your best video to date. It firmly refutes the "theory", as well as explaining exactly why there's a larger problem with engaging with this sort of thing in an engaging and moving way. You've been an inspiration to me and countless others, Natalie, and you're helping a lot of us come out and stand proud, as well as, in my specific case, pushing me to the right starting places to start learning when I was floundering in beginning to understand my identity. Absolutely much love to ya, Nat
Enlightening and funny as always, Patient 655321.
Thank you so much for making this video - you're absolutely brilliant. It's been amazing to see your journey on this channel and I feel more compassion for trans people than I ever have.
Your vulnerability is so admirable.
omg your voice is so perfect, i'm jealous af!!!!
When you hope that all the theoretical underpinning of this sh*t is decades old when we didn't know ny better but it actually is based on a book from only 15 years ago.
When you hope that all the theoretical underpinning of this sh*t is decades old when we didn't know ny better but it actually is based on a book from only 15 years ago.
You rock, Natalie, and I really appreciate your honesty and clarity of thought. Thanks for putting so much effort into this; you're doing a lot of public good
"otherwise i'm fucked" mood.
Autogynephilia, nailed it. I didn't know there was a word for it, but I used to date a guy like that. For him, it was absolutely true. No disrespect here, I don't think it's some universal truth. I just met one guy, one time, that this term applied to. In my line of work I come across a lot of paraphilia's and have to play improv with them, and there's a real bias towards forced feminization fantasies.  I love hearing about everything you're going through. Wish I could be the one to end your dry spell.
Berger is also wrong about the 'Vanity' painting. Vanity in itself can be a turn-on because it is an expression of power. For example, if the painter was a masochist, the notion of the image is vastly different than if the painter was sadistic.  He goes on to add that the moment of nakedness is accompanied by a sensation of deep and instant dissapointment though - which clearly cannot always be the case. I think it's a bit like Freud thinking everyone wants to fuck their mother because that's what he grew up wanting to do. The mere suggestion that it is the universal case suggests that inbreeding is beneficial to evolution. etc
I wouldn't tell the things you tell to the internet to my closest friends. I appreciate the openness but I hope you don't pain yourself too much trying to explain yourself to the internet.
i hope all transgender seek help for their disorder and get better soon!!! lots of love
I started hormones at around the same age.
In the case of the narcissitic type, is that not the case with bodybuilders? They are seeking perfection. We do not consider that a paraphelia because self-improvement is the easiest road to a better life.  He's viewing the behavior 'after' the transition without explaining how the transition thinking was established - i.e. How the person started to relate their 'perfect look' as necessitating a person of a different gender. The fact he splits transgenders into gay and straight suggests he was aware of this - in fact he builds it into his argument for the gay transgender, 'He transitions in order to pull guys better'.  The straight transgender cannot have this motive in mind, because they want to pull women. I think the simplest explanation is a split personality that becomes eradicated as the transition personality becomes dominant.
A-are you me?
Abigail is so evil and yet her style is so good.
Very impressed... much resonates with me about your early experiences. Your final words are spot on - I am *that* person. I am fucked.  Blanchard is a quack.
Is that Voiceover the guy from Gameranx?
your honor the defendant does not bleed.
you are inspiring, informative and damn brave. as always your content is informative and hilarious, honestly thank you so much for existing, the world is legitimately so much better with you in it <3
Blanchards theory is incorrect because it is correct. Before you can have sex, you have to have a sexuality that you are expressing with it, therefore some level of autophilia is an absolute condition for absolutely all sexual desires. So, if men feel autogynephilia instead of the autoANDROphilia that all other non-asexual men are feeling, it proves once again that they are real women.  This also means that an above-average level of autophilia happens equally often in all genders. But, in contradiction to the above, it is also a whole independent sexual orientation in itself, as well as the root of sexuality, in the sense that it is independant of and does not contradict the other sexual orientation(s) you might have.  (Note that I'm claiming that sexual orientations are multiple and that, for example, a person with homo- and heterosexual desires is completely different from a person with bisexual desires. Same for all the different types of autophilia).
Aaaagh, christ, this is such a great video! As an addition to the results of Moser's study on "autogynephilia" in cis women, I can confirm as a bisexual cis woman that personally I am frequently turned on "just by the fact of being a woman". Eg. I'm turned on my my hips, breasts etc not just because they're *my* hips and breasts, but *because* they're hips and breasts. It doesn't make me less of a woman, so it doesn't make trans women less legitimate either if they experience the same thing. Ergo, even more fuck yous to Blanchard 😉
F I L T H   I S   C O M I N G   D O N T   W O R R Y
I just learned so much. What a great video. Well done, Natalie.
that's some cool-ass wallpaper
Oh wow.  This is bravery and self reflection as I rarely see it. Well done.
Run away with me. You are a perfect being ❤️☺️😘
I think Blanchard’s theory is an example of transmisogyny, most when it is still believed by people today (as Blanchard may be trans man and non binary erasure and invisibility)
you're an actual princess and I love you so much
Awesome video, thank you so much for your amazing thinking Nathalie. Now could I argue against your wording of female desire? You said women (and you under female hormones) are turned on by emotional closeness. I can get being turned on in a context of getting closer to a man, but intimacy in itself is not something that turns me on. In fact, I think it doesn't turn anyone one; and that desire is induced by a certain ambiguity between closeness and distance that is tantalizing. Either you have a different experience from me, or you 'work' the same way but used the wrong wording. Could this wording have been suggested to you by main stream media about female sexuality? Because it doesn't resonate with my experience (and it's gets to close to describing women as their multi-millennial gender role. I could understand that as transwoman you would  to match supposed female rhetoric in order to 'fit in' with other women. Hell, I want to fit it with other women! But when the discourse starts sounding like telling me that women are their gender role, I'm like, no don't go there, don't sacrifice a century of feminism to be more accepted as a woman.)
this is really great, thanks for being so open, i hope it doesnt have negative repercussions ❤
Oh my God these videos are amazing, feels like a documentary
Thanks for this, Natalie.
Dont wanna do the whole “you’re so bave” cliche, essspecially as a cis straight dude, but I really think this is great that you’ve shared your experience to help really explain this shit and I really hope it helps people understand this shit. I know it has strengthened my understanding. i’ve always loved ur vids and been watching for like a year and i think this one is one of your best and most important
This was perfect!
Naaaaaaat, if those studies with brain scans and ingrained response testing - that showed trans people have brains and reactions more aligned to their gender than their chromossomes - were to be confirmed... Wouldn't that mean a big point in favor of the essentialist view? Like, please? The idea is comfy and I can actually get people's heads around it, pls say yes.  Also, THANKS for this. And yes, hours in the bathroom fixing my hair up.
I learned a lot. Rock on sister.
Amazing video!! Words can’t express how much I appreciate and am touched by your vulnerability and intelligence.
hey uh talking about your own experiences, thank you??? i feel a lot of the same kind of things even being like a full decade younger its gratifying to find someone with the same like kind of feminization breakthrough??? is there a type c lets do this
this was so good as always
Ur hot but I'm straight therefore I hate you.
I am 90 %sure that idea is true but it is about those that use the term soy boy unless that video and this video was made to make us see a connection
Makes sense about originally thinking about a Plinkett-style character as I feel some of the humor you use is very similar to that of RLM/Plinkett.
Even as a trans man, I can relate to this video. Tho there are not really any """scientific""" theories specifically about trans men, I was still pummeled with Freudian "penis envy" BS, and similar things (or worse: that I was just a girl who liked yaoi) when I was young and trying to transition. In fact, it was one of the main sources of my anxiety around deciding to transition. At one point I even stopped T because I started to believe that I was just a perverted self-absorbed misogynist, and I convinced myself I could "just be a morally and philosophically sound lesbian" quoting my 16 y/o self lmao, which didn't last long after I came out of my depressive episode.
31:18 Doesn't everyone just want to feel wanted?
gr8 vid :^)
Thank-you for sharing so much of your personal experiences and perspectives. Your work around these topics helps make discourses more nuanced and assessable
I love this!! You're a brave and wonderful woman! - a trans enby  so much love to you 💖
This episode of Contrapoints was brought to you by sex robots! Sex robots: are you tired of trying to connect with actual human beings? We thought so
It doesn't make any fucking sense.
Future video topic? Yay!
this video was really interesting  thank you for making it
I've noticed his voice and manner of speech changed vs old videos(he tries to speak higher now),is there a reason for that ? Just curious.
That was amazing! I learned so much and this will help a lot with my MtF trans friends. Thank you so much for putting all of yourself on the line for this. You are an amazing woman. And don't let Bailey and Blanchard keep you down. Blanchard's writing exposes him as very likely a closeted bi- or homosexual male with, needless to say, major personal issues.
lmao at the reading of "the man who would be queen". hilarious
Contra, are you an ENTJ? (Regardless of whether you believe in MBTI typology LOL.)
I love the contrapoints' laugh <3
'Cis feminists, you have your thing about witches' Isn't that more of a cis female feminist thing
This seems like it might be true for a handful of crossdressers, but transitioning is way too large an investment for someone without gender dysphoria.
Jesus Christ how am I going to find time in my day to watch all of this...jks I have no life.
Contra, i showed you video about white supremacy to a friend who is fascist and he began to attack you for being trans because he couldn't attack your arguments. You are nice. Thanks for subs, I speak spanish but i can understand write english.
I'm an AFAB agender person who has never undergone hormonal treatments and doesn't experience a lot of gender dysmorphia. I just want to add that my sexual experience as a teenager was more like what you describe after taking hormonal treatments: low libido, didn't really fantasize about people outside of interpersonal connectedness. Now that I am in my 20s and on depo provera, I find myself having the libido you described before you started taking hormones: I feel very visually oriented and catch myself checking out the bodies of men in a way that I hadn't as a teenager, and I masturbate pretty much daily. The only thing that has changed here is my age, and me taking hormonal birth control, so I don't know which is the culprit. But as I age, I find this has become increasingly stronger, where I feel visually oriented and consumed with lust.
Great video.
god i love you and i love this video
I really appreciate your videos. I've always been someone who wants to be inclusive and excepting but sometimes things rub me the wrong way because I don't understand them. The way you explain your experiences are very enlightening and bring me to a better understanding that allows me to be a better ally and person.
I’m Cishet and I am absolutely a autophile. I love the idea that people might find me attractive and desire me, so I look over myself in the mirror all the time, not with desire for myself, but with excitement at the thought of other people’s’ desires for my body.
i'm in love with you
Sex robot you say?  To the lab!
I’m a straight dude and I’d fuck the shit outta you.
Isn't everyone kind of attracted to themselves a little?  Like isn't that why skeezy hotels have mirrors on their ceilings lol.  Autogynephilia is the stupidest thing I've ever fucking heard, ha.
Very admirable how you have shared your experience, it was very raw and REAL life experience. As a self-described/perceived straight male, I feel that I can empathize more deeply with your experience.
holy shit natalie, this was so well done and you are very correct that the genuine sharing of personal experience is something that is so seriously beneficial to this horrific debate of personhood. Your obvious high level of self-awareness and subsequent extremely articulate total honesty is a force to be reckoned with on this one. also, your balance of jokes and other content as well as your ability to effectively frame and structure what you have to say is seriously unbelievable. I did not have time to watch an hour fucking long video today and planned on only watching the first ten minutes or so to get an idea of what you had to say about such a dumbassed theory but fuck! you made me make time  and god the courage needed to do something like this, especially in your position knowing how large your audience is and how much total scrutiny you get all the time.   I will now be a (unfortunately small-donating) patron. you deserve it. fuck, you deserve it.
Hah, your childhood is similar to mine minus the musical instrument thing. It was drawing and art for me (been thinking about going back to that). My teen years was weird because I was pretty early in terms of realizing my bisexual orientation. In terms of my gender identity I think for me it's... fucking weird. Basically, for years I never felt entirely human and I identified strongly with robots (Transformers, Data, etc). I knew rationally I was human (got sick, cuts from falling off my bike, etc) but something always really didn't add to me in particular the fact everyone wanted me to be a 'boy' or 'man' which I always felt like none of that. What made it worse was when people would mock me by calling me a girl and that didn't feel right either. Not inasmuch as I feel fine with physical male traits (frankly, I hate anything to do with them if it's in regard to my body for the most part). Sex was basically a non-starter for me since I always felt so disconnected from my body in this regard. It's not one thing that makes me dysphoric but more of a general masculine appearance and social expectations from others. It's really weird and it's why I've taken so long to even get serious with a therapist and talking to an endocrinologist about HRT. Even now I'm still debating going on HRT since I really feel like I'm neither a man nor a woman. Like wtf would I do to match that feeling of being androgynous with HRT? Shit like this makes it hard I swear. Sorry for the wall of text, I just thought I'd share my experience on this.
My  afab agender ass is extremely confused right now. It's so strange to hear many relatable ideas concerning gender dysphoria and our relationships with self hatred but also having totally different/opposite experiences from coming the other direction along the gender spectrum (so to say) and not having any sense of gendered "essence" or spirit inside me.  I'm also fascinated to hear someone voice the whole "seeing yourself as a scary monster is empowering" thing,  and wonder if anyone can think of afab/trans-masc variants of this?
Yes, cis women want to have sex as walruses.
Well this was a fucking epic. You got a subscriber.
Please change your twitter bio to "leading B-list transexual"
You are sexy s a woman. This comes from a gay man, so maybe it's not tht valuable, but you look gogrous and I'd love to be your platonic non-physical lover.   So come with me, le'ts do the time warp again!
It occurs to me that perhaps one of the things that trans women experience that seems to very closely resembles cis women's experience is not being believed; shit y'all, no one believes us when we say we’re in pain, no one believes us when we say we’re actually capable of being intelligent human beings, or that we can have emotional human experiences without having them be reframed as coming from an overreactive emotional nut case.  So in a way, you could say that by making up all these experience-denying theories, all these old white dudes and terfs are actually just reaffirming trans women’s claim on the feminine experience… they’re just making y’all more of a woman, welcome to the ‘not being believed’ part of womanhood, it’s a party!
Holy fucking shit this is the best thing I have ever watched! On every level. Just holy shit. HOLY SHIT! Fucking amazing. Beautiful. You're amazing. I love it!
Incredible video! Your brave, candid, and honest reflections of your personal journey and insecurities showed tremendous strength of character. You're thoughtful, intellectually rigorous, and goddamn hilarious. Keep up the great work :).
Damn, this video is impressive on every level - the research that went into it, the concise writing, the effort that went into shooting it. Can't wait for all the webcam direct upload responses to it, with garbage lighting, awful audio and meandering thoughts, no script or research, literally zero effort creations that somehow manage to "disprove it" or whatever, made by people who believe lurking on Twitter and Reddit constitutes hard work. This is exemplary work.
I believe it was the renowned scholars William Preston & Theodore Logan who postulated the oft neglected notion: "Be excellent to one-another".  Alright, maybe that's a touch trite.  ...at any rate, that fur coat on the chair makes it look like there's big hairy fat guy hovering behind you.
My favorite video of your channel, congratulations ! Amazing to find something of this quality free on the internet, thanks to your donators ! And even more on a topic that is so important and difficult to talk about (both because it is a "sensitive" subject with a lot of people not willing to change their mind, and because it asked you to give a lot of informations about yourself as you said). Thank you for your videos, i love your work !
#peaktrans
... and speaking of Greek suffixes, why is it -phila rather than -erasty? i.e., autogynerasty? Just for the sake of conceptual clarity, ya know?  I mean, you say you like it, or do you _love_ it?!...   :P   so to speak...   (and now back to your regularly scheduled programming)
I totally identify with this video, some of the trans specific peculiarities in regards to being feminine, were very clearly explained. This is rare. You nailed it for me....
This was an eye opening video good video
I genuinely humbly ask...   I guess it is one thing to weigh up the pro's and con's of transitioning one's gender. But is gender so great anyway? I ask in full awareness of how bad gender dysphoria is for trans people (and how much cisgender people probably take their cisgenderness for granted). We can't just evolve in the blink of an eye. But are humans over specialised biologically? I don't just mean women are more likely to get fibromyalagia, or men are more likely to get severe schizophrenia. If being transdenger is found to be genetic - then what? I've done a lot of research on the brain - I certainly do not adopt the Terf perspective (though I am wary of the evolutionary psychology perspective as well). Is gender a freaking curse basically? - just as having gender dysphoria is.
You are brave and beautiful. Thank you so much for sharing this!
"And I don't want to be whistled at by someone who would whistle at me!"  This is brilliant.
37:42 Yeah, I waited the better part of 38 minutes to comment "yeah, but what's the predictive/scientific/clinical value of neuro-atypically making psychological typologies of trans experience and desire"? Thx for satisfying that itch!    Like why not taxonomize about types of anabolic steroid taking athletes? There are the gay bodybuilders, the autoandrophilic (straight) ones who live life on instagram, the pseudo bisexual ones who admire other ppls instagrams. No shade intended at bodybuilders... it's about how useless it is to categorize ppl in these ways.  Now I'm off to satisfy another itch you caused: googling "internet hormones" and "informed consent clinics".
thank you. I have a mate who decided not to have M-F transition and now says that autogynaphilia explains where he is coming from. As such,  I think there could be something in it but I've not heard the full vid yet.
Your “patient” story is so similar to 90 percent of my long term relationship partners. I am the girl that likes to femonize and add bdsm but most I saw a lot of these other aspects and my most intense rs tge partner liked nails and makeup done on normal everyday. They didn’t feel fully feminine but they did open up about questioning. They saw the kink as way to be their actual true self without the judgement and fear of family disproval.
That smile and little laugh is great lol
This is a great video! Feels like your form just keeps getting better; you can see the thought that goes into it all. Also, the aesthetics of everything is perfect. I love that you keep the genuine giggles and smiles in sometimes, so cute (:
Very thought-provoking. I appreciate your method of narration. You're awesome.
Hey ContraPoints, thanks for helping me figure myself out ❤️
⎠^.^)⎠ ❤︎
Am i the only one who cried at the end of this video? As a transboy this affected me very deeply too. Love you Contra!
Even though this was long, I was never bored. Watching this was time well spent.   So many good, smart, lines. Natalie really has a way of saying things in a way that makes my brain go “Oooooooooh... ah ha... got it.”
subbed
So envious of that pieanna skills. I can't do more than one thing with my hands.
Tnx, this provided a lot of insight that I should have probably looked up much earlier but never bothered to think about.
This is unreal quality. Im just lost in the visuals.
Hey girl!!! 🙂You are rocking those videos! I love to watch you 🙂 Cant wait for more 🙏🌷
Super glad Hbombs Twitter turned me on to your channel. As a brand new afab enby I needed some heavily trans-positive content.
no dogs do go to heaven ;(
I heard commenting helps YouTuber's videos, so here's a trash comment to help game the system that games us.
This a good video you disgusting commie
You are very brave, contra
What is the opera piece at the beginning of this?
Amazing video and now I have a whole lot of feels... heck
Y'know, Nat really put herself out there in this video, and I admire her honesty. It doesn't change how I view her or the validity of her research and the points she had to make--  "I sleep in a bra."  What? No. Nope. I can never see her the same way again.
Wonderful video, as usual. Without going into an amazed hymn about the substance - the Dezign and the Look and especially dezign-related shade. That's what does it for me.   ps I miss those elevated crankiness levels of the past though (smite everything in the most self-deprecating way!!). You're calmer and softer now. I guess because you're happier? I really hope so ^-^
My niece is in transition, and as her cis aunt... I'm trying to support and help her along this path gathering as much information about trans women as I can. Thank you for posting! Very clever way of keeping it real, and entertaining.
This is a seriously great video and I appreciate you sharing it with us.  I can't even understand the amount of courage it must take to let people on fucking YouTube see so deep into your personal experience.  I would like for you to know that your work here and in other videos on your channel has hugely expanded my perspectives and empathy.  You do a truly great job.  Thank you.
I'm in love with you Natalie
Did I hear you use the dreaded T slur
How can someone be THIS self-reflected? I fucking love u Contra!
You are brilliant. 48 mins went by like 5 mins. I also love you. Great video. ❤
As a white cis-male, I can see how being trans is exhausting. I'm not on board with this whole postmodernism thing and I think it was pretty stupid for you to lump this theory in with science, there's no fucking data at all behind any of this discussion, but I wish people would just relax and focus on more important issues rather than what you do with your sex life.
Amazing, well thought out video. I watch all your videos but never really comment so just want to throw some support out there!
That intro is dope, fire, and all the other cool kid adjectives I can't think of right now.
This has nothing to do with the golden one unsubbed came for the shojo love story
Mostly in response to a very small part of the video, but I know many cis women who wear bras to sleep. In fact, I'm thinking of taking up doing it myself. Some people just prefer to be strapped in regardless of chest size, and for some the support is, well, a good idea. In any case, it's definitely a thing women do! So no worries there, Natalie.
48 MINUTES OF GLORY, the wait was worth it! Great video:)
Thank you for making this video. This has been very helpful.
I sleep in a bra, there's at least 2 of us.
I'm a Spanish cisman. You have helped me a lot to understand transgender issues and transexuality. I never had a problem with all of this but, since I haven't met people with gender dysphoria in real life, it was something strange and weird for me. Since I found out your channel a week ago (thanks to your video on the Alt-Right), I am now enlightened on these issues. It also helps that you are an excellent communicator and also very hot both as a genderqueer/pervert and as a trans woman. The technical quality of your videos is also top notch.
this is cool but you're still wrong about capitalism :(
As is so often the case with your videos, the topic is something that I, as a cis male, spend absolutely no time thinking about. Which is why it's so useful and enlightening for you to have made this, cheers. You have a super unique perspective. And the presentation is awesome :)
this music is really eerie
Thank you for this. And thank you for the Rocky Horror in the end, beautiful rendition.
what do your parents think of you?
Cis woman who used to sleep in my bra ;) I still sometimes sleep in bralettes- this was mostly when my boobs were still fairly new and they were very sensitive. And like around period o' clock they're also painful and need protection.
Omg *please* google the fucksaw incident
Blanchard looks so much like Whispers from Sense8
As a cis man, it kind of depresses me that your paraphilic tendencies and your arousal from mostly visual cues went away after you switched to female hormones...  Makes me feel like the parts of my sexuality that feel toxic are just an inevitable consequence of being a man.....
thank you for tha lighting
this dude is alright
"I don't want to be whistled at by the type of people that would whistle at me" YOURE CUTE AF THO??? LIKE FOR REAL. I'd wanna be whistled at by someone that would whistle at you (at least hypothetically... in a world where cat calling was actually just about compliments and not a power dynamic... yeah).
Your videos are amazing on their own but also you're just so unbelievably hot. Sorry to gush.
Dang. Contra, you are marvellous.
This video gave me xenomorphic gender parasitosis
natalie this video was so honest and well shot and well written and wonderful thank you for working so hard on it ❤ also i know a couple of cis women and people who are afab who sleep in bras
This video is fucking awesome. Kudos Contra, Kudos.
May Trump bring back Deus Vult and expel the degeneracy in this country
Natalie, I find you to be such a brave and amazing woman and human being in general. Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts and experiences on this and other topics. I'm a cis woman 9 years your senior, and believe me when I tell you that you've taught me so much that I otherwise may never have learned, and I'm incredibly grateful. Thank you. ❤️
Where's the award for YouTube video essays and why hasn't this already won it?
I can confirm as a cis-woman that many cis-women wear their bras when they sleep, mainly based off the false belief that doing so will keep their bosoms from sagging when they age. The others, aka me, are lazy and just fall asleep in them after downing Baileys ;)
Badass
I never believed in this theory but this video was incredibly educational  and I feel like I even learned something about myself even though I'm not trans. Well done
transsexual is a disgusting genital focused word that invalidates and erases all transGENDER people who don't medically transition. why use transphobic shit lie that? and also it's called allocishet, not just cishet.
I was kinda shocked how deep this video went into you very personal thoughts and experiences. Shocked in a good way. I think it took a lot guts to make this video, and hope it will be helpful to people in the trans community. Well done!
You look really good in a hospital gown.  ... that sounds a bit more threatening than I meant it to.
Im a cis woman and I sleep in a bra 100% of the time. Am I a unicorn?
this is very personal and heartfelt, it’s eye-openings to get your perspective on things and i was happily surprised by how similar my experiences were as a bisexual woman who is gender non-conforming to yours as a trans woman and also happy to know that you might be bi like me! still, you do carry a lot of weight on your shoulders, you shouldn’t have to feel like you have to educate everyone at expense of your own safety and happiness
DOTH THOU BLEED????
Why can't every trans person be as calm and rational and into spending a hours personally unpacking every possible facet of bigoted hatred, projected self-loathing and prideful ignorance for me on a case-by-case basis as you are?
never been more excited for any video ever.
38:00 Yes.
ContraPoints 4 YouTuber of the Year
You are so talented!
I'd bang you Contra, how do you feel about worshiping a cute girl
It's hard to talk about trans sexuality when nobody wants to even mention female sexuality or even sexuality in general.
"found out later that she is from Belize"  At least he referred to her as "she"  #GotEm
Nice video. Hope you get some ass soon friend.
"sex: M"
I really like this video, you're really informative and level headed but also funny and give a fair shake to a bullshit book very classily.
Not sure if "congratulations" is the right thing to say for this video, considering what you said at the end about feeling so hesitant and afraid to post this. You opened up and talked about a lot really personal stuff, and that's hard, and I applaud you. Love your work, always happy to see you in my sub box. Hope you're having a good day. <3
INTERNET HORMONES FROM THE REPUBLIC OF VANUATU: The Contrapoints Story
I'm so gay and straight please help.  -a total bisexual
This is one of the best videos you've ever made, mostly for the insight into your own experiences.
Never heard about Blanchard or autogynephilia before, but tnx for showing me the light, PERVERT!)
im a queer trans man but so much of this resonated with me (perhaps in the opposite direction). i think this video will help anyone who sees it be less ashamed about exploring their sexuality and gender feelings. so well made and honest. thank you so much for making this video, youre amazing <3
tbh I'm glad you switched out the language to make it for "PC cucks." It was more palatable. The other words were actually pretty stressful... This was such an amazing presentation. Really has me thinking about shit I've never considered before. Also, this guys theory is so unbelievably whack. I don't care what time period contextualizes it.
love the lighting
Literally WHAT CANT YOU DO UR VOICE IS SO GOOD
great video! keep it up
You can pass for a woman until you stand up.  Can you get surgery to reduce the size of your body?  You'll pass if you can reduce the size of your big body.  Great make up job btw
Very educational while being humorous...I love it. Great job
I don't think I've ever laughed this hard in my life 38:45
I first encountered the term "autogynephilia" via the CWCki.  Speaking of which, what do you think of Chris-chan, the "TRUE AND ORIGINAL" creator of the shitty Sonic/Pokemon hybrid character, Sonichu?
darling...if you're not sexy, then there is no chance for us mere mortals
Jordan Peterson is a genius.
This video is a masterpiece. You're beautiful and super cool and make me wish I could transition. <3
You are a brave and good person, and I would encourage you to never forget that you are a brave and good person.
Seems some people think transwomen are autogynephilic But I look around me and I see it isn't so Even if some people were autogynephilic What's wrong with that? I'd like to know 'Cause here I go AGAIN!  I want boobs [x4]  I can't explain The feeling's plain to me Now can't you see? Ah, my groin's a chore It only annoys me It's too wiggly  What's wrong with that? I need to know 'Cause here I go AGAIN!  I want boobs [x2]  I adjust my pants every minute I'd rather adjust a bra Sometimes it seems autogynephilic But when I dream it, oh when I dream it It's not about sex at all!  How would I not Want to change My body? [x4]  (I can't explain) How would I not (The feeling's plain to me) Want to change (Say, can't you see) My body ((I want boobs)) [Etc.]  Seems some people think transwomen are autogynephilic But I look around me and I see it isn't so And even if some people were autogynephilic What's wrong with that?  -- Sincerely, a hyper-introverted transhumanist gorilla who _detests_ unimaginative conservatives judging people for how they would better enjoy their lives.

Is that Peter coffin voicing Bailey
"I didn't masturbate until I was fifteen."  I'm an asexual somewhat-cis guy (and I say "somewhat" because I'm extremely effeminate and androgynous and I often jokingly say that I'm barely a man) who was so sheltered and grossed out by sexuality altogether that I didn't discover masturbation until I was twenty. And it was kind of by accident. Then I discovered what I had been missing.   The discovery of masturbation led me to also discover my repressed bisexuality. I'm still asexual, but I've always been a hopeless romantic since childhood. My fantasies about girls were more abstract and innocent than sexual. So I related strongly to that. Now that I'm exploring this a bit more, I also relate to being more visually stimulated by guys and never women, but needing an established interpersonal relationship and connection to a woman to feel attraction toward her.   See, this is why I love this channel's comments section. I can talk about deeply personal TMI things that I would never even tell my therapist.   The people I have told about this seriously do not believe that I never masturbated until I was twenty. They all say that they discovered it when they were merely seven or eight. I don't get it. But I was a sullen child who has always been deeply afraid of sex and intimacy. I like kissing and cuddling, but that's it. When I did accidentally discover masturbation, I was horrified. It felt like I was becoming a primal, pig-headed beast. That my penis now controlled my brain. That I was impure (religious panic holdovers, I guess). But now it's a great thing that helps relieve stress and I get satisfaction that I'll probably never get in actual sex because of my... discomfort with intimacy and my asexuality being a thing. I just can't look at actual porn.  Wait, why am I telling you all this? I'm going to bake a cake.
Hooooly shit, that was incredibly personal, thoughtful, critical, and... as you say, and as I can imagine, really fucking hard? You didn't have to make this video, but you did anyway, so I really want to express how valuable it was to me personally, as I'm sure it is to a lot of other people for various reasons. Not only is it educational and incisive about pretty complicated scientific (and "scientific") theory, but it's extremely validating to hear about experiences reflective of my own. I currently identify as a cis-man, but over the past few years I've started experimenting with cross dressing and gender flipped sexual role play, among other things. I won't go into too much detail, but the way you describe the differences between your sexuality when you were acting as a man vs acting as a woman were particularly revelatory for me. Also the sense of being judged for the way you chose to explore your femininity in the context of transphobic society resonated with me pretty well.  It's not the first time your videos have helped me in this way. I, too, am a perpetually self-loathing alcoholic former philosophy student, and I'm a white boy, so... Yeah, it's pretty obvious how you provide a perspective I can appreciate. But this video is something special. Just.. wow, thank you for sharing this.
Susan Cain has a book with a "Q" like that on it.
I'm scare to google Fucksaw Incident
contra singing three times a lady at the end was  extremely affirming i didnt know i needed it until now
a good counterpoint to the bad autogynephilia theory would be that a lot of trans men/dfab trans people do develop autogynephilia as a kink after transitioning socially and/or medically. i know a fuckton of transdudes who, after coming out as trans (not nescessaryily going on hormones) and as their sexuality developed ended up being into autogynephilia
you're brave and hilarious, thank you for being an intellectual warrior towards light and truth, in the unironic un edgelord way.
"The Power of Love"? - The title of three songs from the 1980's. But two of them were satires imo. And the straight song was from a cis white heteronormative male perspective (that basically didn't have to consider any other view of "love") by Huey Lewis and the News. The other two: imo Frankie Goes to Hollywood was being ironic about the power of love by singing it from the perspective of authority "I'll protect you from the hooded claw. Lead the vampires from your door" which is intended I think as projection - the song itself follows an address that the president of the US would have to say in the minutes leading up to a nuclear holocaust; while "The Power of Love" by Jennifer Rush (who sings in a melancholic style rather than killing the song like Celine Dion did with her cover version) is imo about the expectations on women to almost embody love itself and be virginal and innocent - "Whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can" is like having to continually support your lover while getting nothing in return, and "We're heading for something. Somewhere I've never been. Sometimes I am frightened. But I'm ready to learn. 'Bout the power of love" which is a satirical line about abusive relationships imo, and the accompanying music video shows a sinister world of business and male violence (LOL - I just re-watched the video "as I look in your eyes" and the guy is asleep, and "your voice is warm and tender" while the guy is having a raucous with friends (who are all children) watching the football and she then puts her headphones on and just sits listening to her walkman...   how do people miss these things I don't know?).
NOW PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HIPS
someone took "fuck me gently with a chainsaw" too literally
You're beautiful and intelligent Natalie. Thank you for all that you do
Your wallpaper looks kind of like weird dogs
Is there a distinction being used for transsexuals here? Are we using the term because it was the generally accepted term of the period and thus the word Blanchard would use? Or is it in in contrast to the more broad transgender and to refer to people who are specifically considering, in the process of or have received transition as a subset of transgender individuals? I'm a little confused and almost everyone, including I seem to think yourself, I thought used transgender as the term and so if it is not either of these cases, I'm not sure what it is.
About fucking time we got a Rocky Horror reference in this channel
How do you do lighting like this?
Speaking as a Cis-gendered white male I find these sorts of videos highly illuminating. I will never experience the sort of confusion and alienation you have but at the same time I want to expend some empathy grasping your plight and trying to broaden my world view. I am sorry that you felt this displacement and I hope that the future brings a steady control and acclimation to your new self. And feel free to continue making videos that complain about capitalism, that is what primarily drew me to this station... That and Lindsey Ellis casually tweeting about it.
44:30 - I slept in my "training" bras when I was a preteen. I wanted to feel womanly. This to me, more than many other things, confirms that transitioning is much closer to a second puberty than it is a weird narcissistic fetish. Bras are uncomfortable! I wouldn't wear one to feel sexier, and honestly, from ages 19-26, I really didn't wear one at all unless I had to. Gaining weight changed that, as I started to get lascivious and/or disgusted stares at the grocery store when I didn't wear one.
This is like my second or third time watching this because I don't understand what moderation is. Anyways! Thank you for this easily digested video on some, uhhhhhhh, bad theories about trans women! After watching, I realized I'd seen some of that rhetoric from TERFs and plain old everyday not even vaguely feminists bigots. Obviously, I should still do more reading of both theory and trans women's experiences and feelings, but it's good to have this succinct overview of the concepts! I feel like I'll be better able to help defend my sisters with this knowledge. Thank you!  ... And, entertaining as always. The academic quality of your videos is just so, so, SO enhanced by your presentation. ~Aesthetic Left~
I AM DEEPLY OFFENDED BY THIS!!!  I am a Walrus Sexual, we are a proud community of those who wish to fuck people as walrus'.
This video was both very good and utterly depressing. On one hand, I had only vaguely heard about autogynophilia before, so I did find the video illuminating and interesting, but on the other hand you absolutely shouldn't have to explain your own gender identity in this much detail to anyone. It also sucks that you don't like yourself much, since at least as far as one can tell from a Youtube channel, you seem like a genuinely sweet person. But as someone who is also prone to bouts of self loathing, I get that liking yourself is a pretty complicated matter. Anyway, I hope the TERFs don't go too nuts over this video and thank you for making me a bit smarter again.
Dubstep version of The Montagues and Capulets? Prokofiev would be proud
TBH autogynephilia makes a lot of sense but the homosexual typology of MtFs strikes me as bizarre
I'm embarrassed to admit that I don't know the aria featured in the opening. What is it?
Contra, you are so important and so valuable and I'm thankful I've "met" you. Well, in some way. Thank you, you beautiful brave lady
That laugh at 14:10 was so fucking adorable!!!!
ContraPoints *_DESTROYS_* grubby old professor with *_LOGIC_* and *_REASON_* in _SHOCKING VIDEO!!_
"it's like admitting you enjoy your own body odour" *stops sniffing armpit and looks around awkwardly* what?
Sounds like professor Bailey needs to do more research into this pressing psychological condition by sniffing coke off the ass of at least 5 more trans hookers FOR SCIENCE!!!!!
Just pointing out that there asexual trans folks so transitioning doesn't always have to have a link to sexuality
This is definitely one of my favorite videos you've made. As a trans man, I can't say I fully relate to everything you talk about, but it's still definitely a topic I appreciate. I am so incredibly awed by your strength and vulnerability in sharing so much of your personal life and thoughts. Thank you so much for making this!
Contra, i would like to mke a spanish translation for the subs, so spanish people can watch the video. Is it posible?
I had the same sexual proces, and and i am a bi man, with male genitalia. Weird.
Love you Contra
Amazing video! I wish you broke down - and questioned the cause of - the differences between the sexuality of males and females more. You qualified it using "tends to", etc. and talked about related topics, but I thought it could be expanded on. Are the differences categorical and, if not, how are they distributed? How much is social? Etcetera.  I've heard and seen many accounts that contradict these differences - women who are primarily sexually attracted by physical lust and men who are primarily turned on by personality. The few relevant studies I've read or heard about likewise indicate a trend rather than a rule.  Social factors that could impact this trend include the acceptability of different types of attraction and other behaviour differing by gender (e.g. superficial promiscuity is usually looked down upon for females but idolised for males), feminine gender roles emphasising emotional connection and consideration more than male roles, homophobia disincentivising emotional connection between males more than between females, and (perhaps most significantly) the ability to be (and likelihood of being) around people of a gender the individual is attracted to without the assumption of attraction (and thus an increased opportunity to form connections with people of that gender and view them as people).  I've spoken to and seen plenty of people who are annoyed their relationship doesn't live up to a romanticised ideal of "love" on their terms, or left feeling hollow and unfulfilled by purely sexual or otherwise superficial relationships, and plenty of women who see the behaviour and thoughts of a lot of men, find those unappetizing and place importance on something that seems better (it doesn't necessarily indicate or arise from a biological difference in sexuality). I'm not saying there aren't any biological factors, just that those factors seem far from universal or the only ones at play.  Personally, despite being male (by sex - I'm agender) and feeling lust, I care for a decent conversation much more than sex, though that that may be because I have depression and have been severely isolated for much of my life (which probably impacts my ability to be “lost in the finite”, not that sex, promiscuity, etc. are necessarily bad/against your interests where there is consent).  Sorry for only being critical, I loved the video!
This was exceptionally lovely! Thank you :)
"As the credits rolled, he caressed the screen. A tear rolled down his cheek. He was forever convinced. Contra was indeed a woman, the woman of his dreams. No more he would add "no homo" after admitting to liking...no...loving her. He was transfigured by her vicacity, her velvet voice. From his cold screen far in sweden, he pledged he would love her forever."  Yes, there needs to be more contra/Gloden one Fanfics.
PATIENT 655321!!! A Clockwork Orange reference!!!
I was enthralled from the get-go. I think I took my eyes of the screen maybe 2 times. The neon aesthetic has taken the place of the void behind my eyelids
amazing work as always natalie, you're an incredible woman and i'm so glad you exist in this world. thank you for opening up and making such a genuine and important video, all the love to you!
Oh god, I wanted to hug you so much for the last hour. You are really touching, you are beautiful, you are a brilliant woman. God, I want to hug you so much. (I hope I don't come across as creepy...)
Thank you is all I can say.
This video made me realize, I want to thank you for something, and it's probably not what most people would expect. I try to be open-minded and accepting, but the simple fact is, I don't personally know any LGBTQ people. Well, who knows, maybe I do, and it's just never come up. Think what you want of that, that I live in some repressive backwater or whatever, I don't care. The point is, as much as intellectually I try to be accepting of that stuff, I couldn't shake being emotionally weirded out by it, simply due to lacking any personal encounters with it. When I first started watching your videos, I admit I was weirded out by how open and confrontational you are about your likings. But now, my reaction has switched to "Oh hey, that's cool."  So, thank you for helping normalize all the wonderful weirdness people have out there in this one person's mind.
I’m not sure making this video was a good idea. I’m not sure how cis people will take it. I found some similarities in our experiences as trans women and that’s comforting. I still think you payed far too much attention to the idea of autogynophelia, but this was about the best video I can imagine on it.
"How could an adult decide to switch genders, without there being some connection to sexuality"  -- Okay, but now I'm actually really curious about this, because I've met lot (A LOT) of other ace-spec people who are a variety of flavours of trans. There including those who are interested in no one in any way, like ace-aro + mega sex repulsed. I am legit wondering how they fit into this conversation.
id like to know your thoughts on this study https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4987404/  "The review of the available data seems to support two existing hypotheses: (1) a brain-restricted intersexuality in homosexual MtFs and FtMs and (2) Blanchard’s insight on the existence of two brain phenotypes that differentiate “homosexual” and “nonhomosexual” MtFs."
Adding porno moaning audio to Donna Summer's music is listed under the dictionary definitions of _overkill_ and _super redundant._
I don't normally comment on youtube videos but I love ur channel a whole lot you're so well spoken... you're just such an intelligent and beautiful woman and I feel like you really pierce through issues like... the way you explain things makes just so much sense I feel like anyone could understand it  but I'm commenting bc u look particularly beautiful in this video!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3 <3 <3
ahhh, as always, my words fail me in comparison to the comprehensive and thorough performance you gave on the subject im just gonna say damn also wow @ that beautiful lighting
i like the clockwork orange reference
"the defendant does not bleed" Goddamn since taking my new hormone therapy doses I havent bled in almost a whole year and i'm afab af
I hope you're happy contrapoints, my dog is hiding under the table as I go into my fourth rendition of "I'm a sweet transvestite" and "Eddy's Teddy" XD
As a trans-man, I find it interesting how we're always invisisible when it comes to the subject of sexuality and being trans. No one really accuses trans-men of having a sexual fetish to be men. Like maybe the fact that we're (in the eyes of authors such as that) percieved as women and as women certainly cannot have any sexual desires of their own they don't think to come up with the same nonsense ideas. Even terfs tend to think trans-women = sex perverts and trans-men = internalized misogyny. But I mean, as a trans man even at my earliest fantasies when I was barely at puberty, I would think about being male when thinking about having sex, and from what I gather many trans-guys have such a thing. It's really something not talked about. Not that I want creepy pretentious authors writing books about trans-male sexuality, but still.
I love that you mention Ways of Seeing, I didn't even get that book in art history, it was a short series we watched. Tangentially, The Medium is the Message is also good. I honestly wasn't interested in this stuff during art, it was only after when I picked up a job in multimedia communications that I took an interest in projection and reception, and went down the rabbit hole of propaganda (also a good book) after that. Pretty soon you'll find yourself reading Bad, or the Dumbing of America, Propaganda, Crystallizing Public Opinion and Manufacturing Consent and realize we are literally in a fanfiction of They Live.
laughing so hard @ the cut to Peterson
Good work as always Contra. Keep shining you crazy diamond.
God this is so good. I'm 3+ years into transition and had mostly left this argument behind, but hearing your perspective was refreshing.
When real women say they don't think "trans" women are like them I feel really disheartened. What do people say to this?
50 minutes of Contra's voiccccceeeeeee I'm too gay for this honey please. (Great video though :3)
Rock on. Might have to take talking point notes in case this topic comes up in a training or presentation.
I really, really appreciate this video.  Thank you for making it.
I very much don't regret subscribing.
love you Natalie
"It's for horseback riding!" 😂  I'm a ciswoman and this video actually helped me understand my own sexuality better. Worth every minute!
Natalie, I want to marry you.  That is all.
This video has let me know how miserable and alone I am.
I enjoyed this video, great work! It was presented well, it was entertaining, and I think it carries lots of good messages and ideas. Curious what you chose to use Dr. Jordan Peterson's image at 13:21 when you said "other scientists being silenced by PC cucks". Dr. Peterson goes out of his way to let people know he isn't anti-trans and isn't out to negate or "disprove" transexual people, and his vitriol is aimed at a group of people who he believes are a threat to Western stability (ie SJW/far-left activists).
Very brave of you to talk openly about this. Thank you making this video ❤️
This is a great video. It gave me some new insights and some personal things to think about. Love your content Contra, you’re my favourite YouTuber.
Yeah i def wanna have sex as a walrus. thanks for your support, Natalie <3
Now goodbye horses is stuck in my head. I hope you're proud of yourself.
As a bisexual cis woman, I’ve often questioned the nature of my sexuality. I tend to enjoy pornographic video rather than erotic literature, and I typically find porn that focuses on relationships to be quite tedious. My sexuality is (for the most part) very “masculine” in that sense.  With that being said, there are some instances when I do enjoy the interpersonal aspect of erotic works, but it’s rare. Perhaps it’s because I don’t relate to it. Like, I find characters like Edward Cullen and Christian Grey to be very unappealing, not only because they are sociopaths but also because I don’t care about social status. I find people attractive because of their physical attractiveness AND their character attributes. They could be broke with a shite taste in music, who takes me to McDonalds for our first date and I would still find them attractive.
This video must have been hard for you to make and I would never place the burden on a person to have to justify themselves like this, however I believe that this will help combat transphobia and improve the understanding of sympathetic cis people like me. It's great to see a leftist on YouTube showing such solidarity with their community, keep up the good work comrade Contra.
As a Cis het male "I feel personally attacked by this relatable content". As it is relatable all along the spectrum.  I also have worries of being loved, but also play with identifying as aromatic, considering I am the same age as Natale but have not had any such a relationship, and don't seek one. I wish to rise above it and be liberated and have sexual partners. But I'm unsure of the cause, bad theories about het sexually?
You're so amazing! 😍 I love the video!
I actually really like the way i smell :^(
wow. incredible video. love this.
I haven't watched one of your videos in a few months and damn you look fucking great! Your voice is so soothing too.
When I first saw the framed portrait of Anita Sarkeesian I was like "lol", then at 40:31 when I saw that the plaque on the frame says "Great Man of a Generation Mao Tse-tung" I nearly fell off my chair laughing.
You counter the points well. I like your videos, they make me think.
Loving the Handel...
Yo aquí esperando que alguien subtitule este vídeo al español para poder entenderlo al 100%
Anyone else's hand shoot in the air when she said, "someone please fuck me" before realizing she can't see you through the screen?
I like your face
I disagree that the male sexual perspective is so powerful that it can call itself science. Anything can call itself science - the book in question you talk about is not in any way a piece of serious scientific literature, nor is Blanchard's theory accepted in the psychiatric mainstream (by your own admittance). If anyone has any concrete examples of cultural bias affecting more serious peer reviewed scientific literature, I'd be interested to hear it.
Additionally, there is an interesting historical aspect to autogynephilia in that, until about 2008ish, the theory of autogynephilia was mostly limited in scientific discourse to the cottage industry that was the Human Biodiversity Institute, which eventually coalesced into the proto-alt-right, and whose other great hits include The Bell Curve and The Germ That Makes You Gay (seriously!). The academic writing on the subject is rather incestual on each other's papers, more than you'd expect; a standard Blanchard paper will cite mostly himself, Bailey, Dreger, Lawrence, or Zucker, and likewise for the other four.  Sadly, the lay editor community on Wikipedia is all but taken in by the theory, thus giving the theory more legitimacy than it is actually due. It is totally a coincidence that one of the most active Wikipedia editors to sexology articles is a former colleague of Ken Zucker at CAMH who likes to go around calling trans women "shemales" in academic literature. For some reason, the standard Wikipedia articles about pseudoscience and conflicts of interest don't apply to him, even though they're generally good on other pseudoscience.
as a person that was very radfem-leaning in the past, this video is really eye-opening. thank you! i needed this kind of explanation <3
This was enlightening. Thank you for covering this.
That was an incredible video, thank you Contra. And thank you for being so open with us. Sending you love from France, keep slaying you beautiful girl.
To be fair, Blanchard *did* create a theory of autoandrophilia.  Like twenty-five years after his theory of autogynephilia, so he "wouldn't be accused of sexism".   Because that's how science works, I guess.
"Northwestern University Professor Under Fire After Class Sex Toy Demonstration"  LOL
I would totally have consensual sex with you Contra.
I'm kind of speechless about how amazing this was. Thank you.
Amazing video.
This is great. Really useful for understanding people's different experiences of sexual identity in a way that's more in depth. Particularly the on-average differences of male and female sexuality, and your personal experience of your sexuality developing differently, as a result of hormonal changes, is extremely interesting.   I didn't expect a debunking of some random pseudoscientist to be this fascinating.
Watching this as a trans woman (who coincidentally is at about the same stage in her transition as Natalie) was really kinda exhausting because these are all things I myself have had to agonize and second guess myself over. It's really hard trying to live your own life whilst also trying to avoid reinforcing these commonly held stigmas towards your community at large. Any display of sexuality can be used as a way for people to justify viewing you, and people like you, as perverts and deviants. Idk I'm rambling but at the end of the day it was really nice to see someone being candid and honest about this experience and seeing that I'm not quite aloe so thanks Natalie <3
I really love the content of this video. It's not often I come across something and genuinely feel like I'm learning something new. This might speak more to my own ignorance, but even then your ability to pierce that ignorance and responsibly and contextualize the immense amount of information you incorporate is fantastic.  I really like the idea of the harsh lighting, but it seems blown out in places. That's the only criticism I can really make
Damn this is my third time watching this and like well done i luv this video. but there are sooooo many parts of this where I just had to wince bc it was like too real and hurt. like when natalie misgenders herself in the court room scene, that just like hurt my soul. Such a good video  this seems like such a painful nightmare too make so much luv and respect
Shit...I mean you are the shit! Keep bein you! (and dogs do go to heaven)
Fucksaw is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life
great video as always but frankly i find it a little shady that you started hiding how much you make on patreon.
contra for president
Did you meet Sinbad too?
I got big crush on contara she’s very intelligent
I appreciate this video a lot, Natalie. It's put into words some of the feelings I've had since transitioning. I want to be wanted a lot more these days too. *hug* Thank you so much.
the huge amount of effort you put into your work really pays off. This was such a great video. thats why im worried about coming across as pedantic or nit-picky, but im not sure if the implication that queer cis male attraction to men is just about 'raw physical attraction' or whatever, i related more to your explanation of interpersonal attraction and i think thats an experience of attraction shared by other men attracted to men also
Amazing video, as always. Not only do you have the courage to open up and talk publicly about things I'd never even be able to talk to my SO about, but you encapsulate your arguments well and get the message across far more coherently than most of us can. Your work means a great deal to many of us other trans people -- thank you so much.
Your gender is valid, you are valid, and we love and support you.
Amazing
god I dont even know what to say, I wish I was smart,,, I think its amazing how brave and openly Contra talks like,, her sharing such deeply personal stuff takes some courage! But I hope it may change some peoples minds. I never heard of that theory but some of the arguments seemed familiar cause I heard Terfs use them so,, thanks for the education. I dont think cis people understand like... that.. not being cis is mostly connected with alot of selfhatred. ?? And even though I know these feelings its really sad she feels that way,,, I can only hope that´ll change. And honeslty? OF COURSE someone will love her as a woman like??? Shes fucking amzing,,,, I certainly do hhh (gotta hate fan crushes),,
These are some really personnal shits and it must be really scary to release this video on yt. You are really impressive. Thanks for sharing all of this.  Love you girl.
This is the greatest channel on YouTube
Great video, keep it up!
30:51 EVAN STONE???? XD
16:27 "Furue Video Topic" - I would tear my nipples with laughter if you did this while addressing the absurdity of "red-pilling" as supposedly being anti-SJW, anti-feminist, anti-trans etc, when "red-pilling" is a reference to a film made by two trans women!   XD...   Christ. If anything was an example of how stupid this all is, it is that.
this was absolutely brilliant. i adore your videos and i look up to you as a content creator. thank you so much for sharing.
damn maybe i should transition after all lol
Has anybody ever told you your hair is fucking great? I love it.  BTW, great video as always.
This is a whole ten Sargons of alpha-glorious ContraPoints ContentPoints, I have the patience to sit through this... I came here for complete filth as well as mythbusting on trans rights, and I got both in great abundance
I like this video, as I always dowith your videos. I salute your courage to share such intimate things about your life. And specially, your dedication and discipline to refute academic theories with scientific claims.
This is extremely well done. Best video youve done by far
As someone who saw and consumed lots of drawn and written erotica, mostly made by women, yes there are some differences from erotica made by and for cishet men. Mostly in the ways they portray bodies somehow. However I also think there is quite a bit of horniness for them bodies and the men. Maybe this is a subculture thing. I think there are big, prevalent narratives that shape people's sexuality into approved boxes, and there is hard to find alternatives for them. Wow human sexuality is god damn complicated.
Sunny Bono is a transgender person who became male right
45:10 Holy shit. I just snorted hot coffee through my nose.
Watching this video was like watching 50 minutes of open heart surgery.
you might say the courtroom skit was a kafkaesque trap
Normally I agree with everything you have to say, but I take a lot of issue with the suggestion that dogs don't go to heaven :(
A theory that can't be falsified is scientifically useless (at least within the current paradigm of Popperian Falsificationism). This may be enough  to dismiss Blanchard's claims, since the whole thing amounts to little more than a tautology.    It also seems odd that the theory focuses mainly to trans women, but not on trans men, given that the two are somewhat related.
What is the opera song at the beginning?
50 mins of contra is love, 50 mins of contra is life
Natalie —thank you so much. It’s obvious that you don’t always make videos for yourself. I can only imagine the emotional risk and vulnerability that making this video would require. You say what needs to be said, not always what you want to say. As a cis woman, this video certainly helped me better understand your experiences, and probably the experiences of other trans women as well, and I’m sure that this video probably made several people reconsider their transphobic or TERFy beliefs. Your videos are always so insightful and well made, and I think you’re truly brilliant. Keep up the amazing work, my special blossom 💕
Great video, this was completely new territory for me, I had never heard about this before. The only thing that really shocked me was to know you sleep with a bra (wow it's really uncomfortable, I don't know how you do it).
This was a really cool video. Thanks.
I really like this channel, miss ContraPoints. The topics are well researched and the ideas are well presented, the format is entertaining with your charm, wit and aesthetic. Even when I don't find myself agreeing with you by the end of the video, I'm still inclined to hit that like button.  Weird sidenote, when you mentioned Rocky Horror I got this weird image that popped into my head where you were Janet and that fopdoodle "the golden one" was Rocky... (Do you think he eats nutritious, high protein... Swallows raw eggs?)  Sure,  The Rocky Horror Picture Show IS pretty problematic, but... Isn't that actually weirdly part of it's charm? It makes you fall in love with the villain, even though he's a murderous, rapey, oversexualized cannibal alien who also is some kind of crazy scientist, making a man from scratch to keep as a sex slave. I think the reason it still gets away with it is that is so over the top, and all the characters are such campy, satirical caricatures of themselves. And it being a fucking musical.  I fully understand why some people might have a problem with it, as it gets away with being so unapologetically controversial and fucked up, and back in the day it may actually have helped reaffirmed the misconception that cross-dressers, drag queens and trans women are all the same thing.
It seems at first glance that the strongest counter point in here is that this typology would identify heterosexual cis women as being autogynophilic. To my mind that means that he has not really described anything "new", so much as assumed that these mental states are unnatural apriori and them simply described a subset of them in language that reinforces that assumption. If asexually reproducing martians were to show up and attempt to use this typology without prior knowledge, they would not make heads or tails of it. It would not help them describe human behaviour.
It was amazingly brave of you to share what you did. It was also incredibly humanizing. For what it's worth,  I was very moved by your honesty, sincerity, and trust. I wish you all the best.
Real motherfucking gender studies hours who up? I loved this video and I love your more academic stuff. You spoil us.
Looong, loved it. Cute ending as well.
Awesome vid <3
17:50 - The filth starts
You're a good woman, Natalie Brown
Peter Coffin really needs to do more erotic audiobooks. He is just perfect for the job.
That highlight Nat mmmmyes
I've got a potentially problematic opinion: I miss the ContaPoints that didn't transition the whole way through yet and played both male and female roles. I also liked the way she looked when she was a guy too. That being said, I still love her lots and her video quality definitely increased. I'm also really glad that she made the decision to transition, since she's probably happier.
I love your videos! so damn great #contrapointsophilia
Good video. I hadn't heard of any of these theories but it's helpful to see the assumptions' of bigots laid out systematically. I found this video useful for the same reason I found your  earlier diagram of the connection between sexism, racism and antisemitism in the Golden One video helpful. It's one thing to basically get that some wrong ideas exist to oppress people, it's another to understand how those wrong ideas convince people when it's all fit together into a semi coherent ideology.
My apologies for trying to summarize a video of nearly 50 minutes long, but so basically: it isn't that trans women want to transition so they can express their fetish like desire to dress up as a woman during sex, it's that this fetish like desire of (closeted) trans women to dress up as women during sex is really a way for them to express their gender identity.
Very informative video. I had never heard of the word in the title before. Or most greek sounding words you used.
Thank you so much for this video. I was born with a vagina and I’m very happy with it so I guess I’m not a trans-woman, but I really enjoyed the video anyways. It’s so comforting to hear you talk about female sexuality since it’s a subject that does not get enough attention. It’s so depressing sometimes to live in a world where almost everything is viewed through hetero-male sexuality, especially media and I should not even talk about porn. I do like to watch porn sometimes but it mostly ends badly. You have lived as a man and through transition to a female I get the feeling that you understand both sides better. At lest more than most people.
If you start with the supposition that trans women are... women... the Cluster A vs B thing turns into "most girly girl kids grow up to be straight women and more tomboys grow up to be lesbians, but there are still enough exceptions that this can't even be considered a rule."  Which... wow. What a break through, right?  Great video <3
God I need more content from Contrapoints. So good!
His "theory" is ridiculously unscientific. His methodology was extremely biased, and unfalsifiable.
Anthony Weiner lived up to the theory of nomative determinism
Abigail Cockbane is a fake goth
Ey bb, you keep doing you. You are so loveable and already have many people (who maybe you don't realize) love you for who you are as a woman. Xoxo, Hen
Reminder that some trans people are asexual and so for them trans really isn't a sexual thing at all
Such a great video, very educational. Also the Terf character hits so many nails on the head, like... almost every single terf I've seen online acts like that, or pretends NOT to act like that but actually does
thanks you! This video was beautiful and it made me think and laugh and reflect on my own insecurities/internalised transphobia as a trans boy and transmisogyny... so many things! Really enjoyed it, well done and thank you for being so vulnerable and open. <3
Contra, your lighting always blows me away. Fantastic job.
I like you.
Wow.  The central section here is incredibly honest, and I have learned a lot.
Wait....are you saying the NoFaps are trying to have the sex drives of women?
i’m concerned about your alcoholism
26:07 Best Look 100% bravo! That lighting OMG
This video is highly empathy provoking.
Good work! <3
fucking incredible. loved every minute. subbed. keep it up.
This has really, really helped me understand how (some) trans people feel. As I sometimes question my own gender identity, and this can serve as some way of guidance to get muh feels in order, I thank you a lot
The pirate at 30:51 looks very familiar. Where have I seen him before? 😂
If someone is interested: a lot of cis women sleep with their bras on. Sometimes it is just uncomfortable depending on your cup size and  some say they just like the feeling of beeing comforted. I love that despite everyones different experiences, whether cis or trans, how this is just such an everyday female experience to have! :D
I’m not trans but this video still resonated with me, especially 30:11 cheers
sounds about right self centered narcissists
43:41 LMAO.... funniest shit ever.
Straight white cismale here, crying like a little toddler at 48:00
Yeah, I have read "Fifty shades of grey" too. For research purposes LOL. No but seriously... the book wasn't actually all that bad. Haven't seen the movie though.
a e s t h e t i c
"The defendant does not bleed."  For whatever reason, that made me think of Batman Vs Superman.   Batman: Do you bleed?  Superman: No, I am not a woman.  Batman: Huh, that not what I meant!
Thank you for this video, confirming once again that you are a lovely, open, brave and outspoken person. It's a pleasure seeing you grow into a beautiful and strong woman, and I can no longer see you any other way. But girl, did you get that postbox yet? This is NOT a euphemism, I'm asking about a literal postbox that I mailed you about ages ago.
I think I learned something.  I guess?
Natalie, your skin is GlOwInG 😍
Rational Wiki nailed it well I think. The big issue with Blanchard's pet diagnosis is it ignores trans men existing, entirely.
Nat i love u
... I wear a bra to bed.  I also think your awesome.
I wonder if this doesn't just stem down from the "Its a trap" mentality that makes males respond in one of two ways 1) horror and disgust or 2) eroticism. Though I don't really know how that mentality affects TERFs... maybe they're jealous? No idea
Sweet.... a long video. Just the thing I was looking for. I'm fixing the lining and the fit on some of my suits. Tailoring can be boring....
I love you.  Please keep making videos.
Riley J. Dennis 0.1 fuck me you BIGOT dyke.
my old computer's graphics card is AGP, it makes itself pretty hot.
DOST THOU BLEED
Seems like the argument against autogyno-whatever-the-fuck could easily be boiled down to:  Why on earth would somebody choose to go through the effort of living as the other gender just to fulfill a fetish? Also, who in all seriousness is turned on by their own body? I think no matter what we look like or what changes we go through, humans are programmed to accept their own body as completely neutral and not sexualise it.
Your account sounds very much like my own, aside from my not wanting to live as a woman, but have more freedom in expression.  Your childhood sounds familiar as well.  I also am Gynophilic (sp), but like you my attraction to women does not include automatic intercourse, and definitely platonic (and there is nothing similar for me when it comes to men.  I have zero interest in men in that realm) I do like how at the end you shoot down the insane idea that even Autogynephilia is a BAD THING.  There is nobody that is hurt, there is no one losing their homes (unless there is a cisnorm person kicking a trans out of their home due to prejudice.)  Also...Goths wear fishnets (physical sex does not matter :P ) Thank you for this video.  It is a message that needs to get out there.  Oh, and Blanchard and Baily need to vanish.
30 Seconds in, and I'm only seeing Baileys and ice. I'd hope that another type of alcohol makes its way into the glass.
if you are not having perverted sex, then you an't living.
From beneath her clothes, a fearsome truth unfurls It is black and wispy, patterned with stars. A blossoming terror for those who wish simple answers. Beyond the scope of time, her self is laid bare, seen in the echoes of people she was, and could have been, and may yet become. The silky, fabric flesh of a lifetime, exposed, stretched thin.  Displayed not without fear but with certainty. Her form is fragile, delicate, vulnerable, if only mortal blades could hope to pierce the soul. She is truth. And this is what galaxies are made of.
I've been fan of Shaun and Lindsay Ellis and many people in the comment section of both were also happy you uploaded a video today. Man I am happy to have discovered your channel, I look forward going through the back catalog.
That Abigail bit was just hilarious. Fantastic video, perhaps your best.
omg I just miss the old male look contrapoints, and I feel there is probably no turning back
I love you, contra  <3 I know how hard it is to be so publicly vulnerable -- okay, I don't because the closest I've come to that is publishing an article detailing my medical history as a disabled trans person in my small university's newspaper under my, albeit uncommon, first name-- but I can imagine how much harder this form of public vulnerability is. And, for what it's worth, while I fully acknowledge the shittiness of the trans masc community, some of us care <3
A Contra video and a Lindsay Ellis video both go up on the same day? I am a happy boi
😘 this is great
This is so grim. I wanna go back to making fun of The Golden One...
So, who wants to party with Cher? She sounds amazing.
I am a cis male in a poor country, and never had tô think too much about these things. I feel profoundly Grateful for you to explain them in a way that is personal, intellectually honest and amazingly funny. You're the best and should be Very proud of yourself!
are there any voice records i could go listen to of you as a male (while a male or while still a male if you prefer)? Of even more interest would be you as a male and tied up into something, anything, long enough for you to pause masturbating for a few days.
FWIW: my wife sleeps in a bra on the regular, so you aren't alone Contra.   Love the video it really helped me understand some things I've found hard to wrap my head around!
Thank you! As a cis man I've been trying to gain a better understanding of transexual people for a while now, this really helps.
More women are into feminizing guys than one might think, but more guys (including cis-het guys) are at least comfortable with being feminized by their partners than one might think.
I'm sorry you had to make this video
Too woke
This is brilliant
I feel like I want to sometimes dress up as a "man who dresses up as a woman". Drag style.
No redemption arc yet ;_;
My stepbrother is trans, so I find this interesting even if a bit bewildering. Not to mention I like your other videos. Can we be drinking buddies now.....please?
Natalie, I just have to say that I fall more and more in love with you and your content with every video you post. I'm so glad I decided to support you on Patreon. You make my world a little better. ❤
I broke down in tears.
ahhh this is the argument that kills me. I think i became autogynephillic after finding tg fiction a  few years after wishing i was a girl in my early teens. now i have started questioning in my late 20s all of the shit i did is so invalidating and my memories are so cloudy its hard to tell what came first. Still wish i was a girl though
I was kinda sad that contra hadn't uploaded in a while, but now I see what you've been up to!!! Terrific video! And a topic that I had never heard of before
Is the guy who reads the text from ACG?
This video makes me want to trick psychiatrists into giving me estrogen so I can masturbate better.
As a fellow trans woman, and one who finds themselves pretty thoroughly entrenched in far left beliefs that would likely put me under the scrutiny of the anti-sjw type folks, I super appreciate all of your content ESPECIALLY this video.
I've been taking a break, because the filth pandering actually started to get to me, and I have to say this: I've missed you SO MUCH! (No, not BECAUSE of the filth pandering, that's what was getting to me, but you know...right?? You know what I mean. You are an amazing person/funniest person in existence.)
Adding Blanchard to my ever growing list of people that I despise.
why are closed captions not available for this video?
This is as intimate as conversations I wish I could have with some of my best friends. Honest and open-hearted, a very important insight for me and, I'm sure, everyone. There is a lot of courage here and dedication.  Thank you Natalie <3
I FIND OUT LATER THAT SHE IS FROM BELIZE.  I'm dying.
I like your videos but 50 mins. to much
Somewhat wierd question I guess but nonetheless. Did your view on alcohol consumption change since you transitioned? Does being intoxicated feel the same? Do you feel like you get the "same feeling" out of it? I realize this is a very wierd question but I'm curious what you think about it
Very brave of you to make this, I got your back no matter what !
81 people found out later that she is from Belize.
I'm a trans woman and loved this so much. Esp glad that I'm not alone in rejecting the essence theory.
Wow Natalie, your lighting is Extremely Good.
This was brilliant. I appreciate your openness about your experience. You're a beautiful woman.   P.S. I once commented on one of your videos before you transitioned saying how confused I was being attracted to you. Now I don't have to be confused about that any more. ;)
... I think this is possibly the best YouTube video I’ve ever watched by anyone.
Contrapoints raises some very good points but then I think back about some of her past videos and it does make me question some of the more ''sexually suggestive'' content. This could all stand loose of her gender identity but it does raise a couple questions in regard to this video.
>"Women are attracted to the emotional part and they don't get turned on merely by visuals" This is not true and all and you won't find a single study to prove what you said. You copied a harmful and dumb stereotype made up by Christians in order to shame women for their sexuality and cherry-picked some examples.  >"Hormones change sexuality and cause people to masturbate less" That's some giant bullshit only supported by your anecdotal evidence. You want some more anecdotal evidence? I'm on HRT (50mg CPA [which is the strongest AA available] and 2.5mg estradiol) and I masturbate daily lol. I always had the same fetishes, among which some may be considered hardcore. They didn't vanish and that's super cool because no one should be shamed for their fetishes. The only change that I've noticed is that I no longer ejaculate and I don't have spontanous erections.
Brutal. Fucking brutal. Take care Natalie.
Thank you so much for what must have been a very difficult video to write. As somebody who is also about five months into transitioning in their late 20s, hearing about the way your experience of gender & sexuality has changed throughout the early months of your transition has helped me to feel that my experience is not totally weird and invalid. 'Taking one for the team' in the way you did is pretty damn selfless and I, for one, am very grateful to you for it.
<3
Loved the lighting :) And everything else.
If women aren't visual, then explain yaoi.
What do you think constitutes "living as a woman" as youve mentioned around 17:00? Im interested in what areas does that cover. Tossing out some examples, which may or may not fall into your definition and you may or may not constitute "living as a woman" compared to "living as non-woman" or at least "living as mostly non-woman": sex life (be it heterosexual or homosexual), self presentation, which could split into looks, voice, non-verbal communication, dating strategies, any patterns of thinking maybe etc? And no, Im not accusing you of TERFing or anything, nor Im trying to convey this as my attitude.  43:00 CULTURAL APPROPRIATION ehh, ?KINKSTURAL?, i dont know, lol.
I love the Clockwork Orange reference.
Btw. here is a link to a video by Seeker which details a host of more recent "actual" scientific research on trangender issues, including some interesting MRI studies. A lot of it seems to tear Blanchard's theories apart.  https://youtu.be/CsbtQ2-kUwA
u are amazing thank u for this blessing of a video
EXCELLENT JOB.
WOW.  Respect.
The level of detailed critique combined with sheer entertainment value in your videos puts all other people talking about this stuff to shame. I don't think I'll ever watch another Riley J Dennis video again. Thank you, you have an amazing mind
this is a great movie
You're so awesome at the piano :D
Thank you for sharing your personal experience and I'm sorry that you have to argue transphobic theories like that
Contra, you look so good in those glasses!
:( sorry you had to make this video - shouldn't  have to explain your existence to haters
Abigail what's your damage?
I love you so much Natalie. You are a bright, shining light in dark times. I started transitioning right before you and it's been amazing watching you blossom. Whenever I stay up too late torturing myself on gendercritical and start doubting myself, your thorough rationality is one of the few things that can put me back in a good headspace. Thank you for everything you do 💜
I held off watching the unfinished version on Patreon to see it in it's final glory, fascinating. EDIT: I just realised I'm into feminization. Thanks Natalie!
I was specting the part 2 on "what's wrong with captalism", but a video refuting Ray Blanchard is more than perfect.  Thank you, Contra.
Fucking brilliant video Natalie. <3
45:20  D E C E A S E D
hi contrapoints, i'm a trans woman who actually is autogynephilic, so although i'm really happy you are taking down the shitty theory of it being a cause or contributor to being transgender, i would say that autogyneohilia definitely is a type of sexual attraction, so yeah you don't need to read up on stories of other trans women autogynephiles, you can ask me right here, and yeah you're calling me weird so feels pretty bad tbh. i mean i would still want to transition even if i wasn't autogynephilic so separating the two is important, just don't throw us under the bus in the process. here is a much better defense against it, is it wrong for a trans woman to not want to transition at all? yep, transitioning doesn't make you transgender, wanting to transition doesn't make you transgender, biology is not actually determinate in gender. here are my thoughts about gender btw https://medium.com/@lulzbane/genre-gender-what-is-it-eda9a6d5460a
I haven't watched you in awhile but oh my god! You've changed so much, good luck with the rest of your transition, you already look great :)
Just cos there is people with genuine dysphoria out there doesn't mean there isn't also genuine autogynephiles too. Your video is like sayin because  there is real homosexuality, that means theres no such thing as bisexuality. The two are different states of being. There are definitely autogynephiles in the world, and you can't deny their existence because there also exists genuine dysphoric people.
The soundtrack of this video is so great, I want to hear Contra talk about her music preferences!!! This is not to try and distract from the excellent video, by the way. Thank you so much Contra! Oh that last chord was so nice :)
I think it's readily obvious that Michael Bailey is a hack, never mind the actual content of his words. That he's wrong comes as no surprise.
"... his playing Bacccccchhhhhhh at the piano..." thank you for that you're the best XD
Oh, fuck. An hour. It felt like 20 minutes.
This was very good. I watched it twice.  I know this wasn't an easy video to make and I'm NOT talking about the production of the video. Scripting, producing, editing, etc.  I quit arguing with people about transsexual shit mostly because I find it fruitless. For these people it is nothing more than about controlling your behavior, they are disinterested in the problem itself in spite of their platitudes otherwise.
Hey, I really enjoy your work and willingness to put yourself out there! Even though I might not always agree with you 100%, your thoughts help me think deeper about the issues at hand.  Please keep up the good work!
is there somewhere i can check out the lighting set up ContraPoints uses? its buck wild and i love it
Thanks, I had heard of this theory before and didn't know what to make of it, you have been most helpful.
Well, walruses are admittedly quite curvy.
Wow, Natalie, where to begin?   First, I have been a scientist my entire adult life and among the many sciences I have studied, Public Health and Psychology have proved of great interest to me. I have edited scientific journals articles and have been involved in a great deal of scientific research over the years and I can say without a doubt that you are (as usual) spot on in your critique of Blanchard's theory.  I have to agree completely that his research methodology is poorly contrived and he overreaches significantly on his conclusions time and time again. Sadly, like in most areas of life, there are just too damn many misogynistic and bigoted a-holes in scientific research institutions. I have spent the last 20 years of my life involved in both the industral and academic scientific communities. It is still not pretty out there from gender, social, and cultural freedom perspectives in many areas of this country.  Secondly, I must add that your cinematography skills are improving constantly.  This is a superbly constructed and executed video. Top notch 'eh.  Thirdly, I am musician as well and love to learn crazy old tunes that one rarely hears covered. I nearly peed my pants when you started playing Time Warp on your piano. To say I experienced a moment of pure joy just then is putting it lightly.  The only thing that could have been better would have been to hear you play Hot Patootie. Now that would be bliss. :)  Lastly, keep the faith in love, peace, and understanding. Perhaps someday the bigots will learn to just let people live their own lives and quit harming, discriminating against and stigmatizing the LGBT+ community.  They need to stop punching down at marginalized populations and realize their true oppressors are the oligarchs that keep them suppressed in servitude and squalor.  None is so enslaved as the one that is unaware of their own enslavement.
What a fuckin masterpiece this video is
0:39 "Contra-versial"? I see what you did there. ;=)
Is it okay for me - a 'cis' guy - to say that I'd fuck you?  Is that 'trans fetishisation' or something? Problematic and so on? Will I need to identify as some pointless sexuality that includes attraction to cis and trans women? Do I have some obscure 'philia' or something?  I can't tell what's politically correct or incorrect anymore fam.
Thank you Contapoints! I know this will sound all trite and sappy but I hope you soon find love and happiness in your future relationships.
Your just awesome and great and Nice and really Nice Good Love 💌💌💌💌💌
Amazing analysis! You should get into academics ...oh wait!
you're inspirational, thank you
Your channel has taught me so much since Olly from philosophy tube recommended you to me a few months back (get him on you're stream again! you two have the best banter), but when you opened up in this video, it really struck chords with me. Many of my experiences of and with my own queerness lined up with the things you described. I'm thoroughly doubtful that I'm in any way trans or atypical in gender beyond what would be standard deviation for bisexual cis men, and I'm not precisely sure what it is about what you described seems to resonate with me so much, but your video has certainly illuminated... something.Some aspect of myself that I still only rudimentally understand. Something that I'm sure to explore and hash out in my own time, but either way, know that whatever this thing may be, wherever this journey may lead, it started here. Thank you.
So, as always, I love your videos, but are you like destroying your eyes doing this? Some of those pink lights hurt to look at from through a youtube video, and you obviously had to deal with them for way longer and more directly.
I love your videos so much wow
I had a cis girl friend who slept in her bra but only during her period
Great video :)
"transbaby"  I hope to God that's a joke.
Really good video! Thank you for your hard work
Thank you ContraPoints this was a very inlighting video and helped me understand the perspective of trans women. Great Job!
Hey there, ContraPoints! I actually just got here; this video was linked to me by a freshly-met nonbinary acquaintance who has been a fan of you for some time, and I had to check the content out based solely on the video's thumbnail.  As a transman, I can admit, acknowledge, and avow that I will never face the same amount of oppression, fear, and exclusion that a transfeminine person has the potential to face in their lifetime. You managed to capture many of the aspects of the transfeminine dichotomy in this video, as far as I can see (considering how my own experience is NOT corresponding with it and how all my knowledge of the subject comes from transfeminine friends) and I feel even more enlightened on the subject as a result!  In fact, some of the points you made in regards to the counter-theory against Bailey's approach (feminine essence theory) actually struck especially true for me, despite the fact that I am transmasculine and you are transfeminine! The idea that the reality of the situation is so much deeper (and sits in psychological/biological/sociological upbringing and maturity) has always made more sense to me, but it is a thousand times easier to state something soulful like "I am a boy within a girl's body."  Additionally, I feel as though you have a serious point in the approach to the differences between the sexualities expressed by different sorts of people. Many cis women I know who are inherently attracted to women have a more spiritual approach to the attraction, in that they are interested in the idea of someone who (as you said) has good taste and can be considered trustworthy with that taste because of the shared womanhood. There is also the flipside, with cis men interested in men being attracted to the idea of someone that reaffirms their day-to-day life or inner emotional conflict as something that does not detract from their own ability to be sexy. It's fascinating, really, and I'd love to see more videos on your views of THIS subject in particular. (If there are already a few in existence, I'm going to hunt them down, so please pardon the assumption that there are not!)  I adored your speaking points, and the little dollops of comedy throughout the work. Humor has a way of reaching me faster than well-thought-out logic ever will, and I had fun watching this video despite the heavy topics you have addressed and the intensely personal information that you have given out to the public as a means to help your points across. This was a lovely video, ContraPoints, and a fantastic first video. I've subscribed and I will be looking into more of your work as a result of the fantastic job you did in this posting. Thank you very much for the information, the logic, and the hilarious court scene (which, at the end, really does display the irony of not being able to win an argument, even when you're right, against people with the mentality that Bailey harbors). I hope you have a lovely day!  P.S. The lighting in this video was EXCELLENT. Very pop-art! It kept the screen visually interesting, which definitely kept me from tabbing out and drawing with the video as backfiller. Lovely work!
44:29 Cis women do sometimes sleep in bras, Contra. Not likely a push-up, wired version but, for the larger ladies, a firmer hold on the bosom helps with turning in a bed.
Honestly, this video has taught me that I'm probably about to go into the "trying out for an authentic version of enbyness" phase of transness. Though at least I no-one's come up with a theory (yet) about how enbyness is actually a fetish. You put up with awful shit. Great video as always.
Really rare combination of vulnerability and analysis here, I don't know many people who can put themselves on the spot like that while carrying an argument at the same time. Color me impressed.  The new singing voice is nice too. Hard work and practice paying off.
You're incredible.
I'm a cis woman and I masturbate in front of a mirror. Take that, Baileys Cream.
37:42 super cute
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4987404/  The review of the available data seems to support two existing hypotheses: (1) a brain-restricted intersexuality in homosexual MtFs and FtMs and (2) Blanchard’s insight on the existence of two brain phenotypes that differentiate “homosexual” and “nonhomosexual” MtFs.
I’m a cis woman and sleep wearing a bralette, does that count?  Admittedly I’m apparently a big ol’ autogynophile myself so perhaps I am Spiders Georg
Contra, your production is through the roof! Awesome vid!
My only nitpick is where you talk about what makes you trans.  I'm a trans woman too, and how I've always seen it is if our brains weren't female - or "close enough" - hrt wouldn't work. It would make us feel worse. Cis men who've been on estrogen don't like it. They get depressed because their brains aren't built for female hormone levels. I agree with the idea that "essential womanhood" is a totally misleading idea, since no one is born with the experience of already having lived as a gender and dealing with all the associated baggage, but I don't think it's misleading to say there's an essential "female" quality to trans women's brains.  Gender roles are enculturated bullshit, but the sex differences they're built on aren't. Neurologically, at least. Anatomy, as our existence proves, has nothing to do with it.  Everything else in the video was perfect and amazing and I really admire the courage it must have taken to put all this out into the internet. I had a lot of similar experiences growing up and feelings about my sexuality, and even though I've transitioned and made peace with all the confusion and pain, I know I wouldn't have been able to do what you did.
"it was like my soul had to leave my body so that I could let the poison out"  My Goddess all of these are EXACTLY the words I thought to myself o_O
I really love the irony of Abigail now. A TERF woman that is a played by a trans woman themselves putting a trans woman on trial for being a trans woman.
Damn, I adore you and your work.
Bringing attention to these issues is important. One can argue that this perpetuates trans-phobia by bringing attention to it's  ideologies, but not challenging these ideologies is much more dangerous. In my opinion its also irresponsible. As representatives of the ACTUAL EXPERIENCES of people in our community, it is our responsibility to advocate for it. Thank you for putting in the work for me, yourself, and everyone ells in the trans community. You did it right as well. To better put it, you did it smart?.. At least better in my dyslexic head. Anyway, you challenged confrontational theories with logic and intelligence. You approached this very dehumanizing and personal topic with not only patients, but with grace, and wit, and charm, and beauty, and brains, and creativity, an... *Blushes* *Clears throat* Anyway anyway, I relate to your personal story quite a bit. That being said I'm very grateful you have the courage to bring light to our very similar experience. I have an even clearer understanding of myself after gushing over this video. Now if you would please stop crushing my heart you magnificent creator!
This is amazing. I'm a straight trans woman(homosexual transsexual lawl), and you unpacked all of this amazingly well. Thank you!
I sleep in a bra so I don't have to wash it. Aren't you supposed to sleep in a bra anyway?
You really shouldn't drink too much when you are on HRT. Please take care of your cute little liver. Also love the video 🌸
"Why can't all Trans people be like you." is on par with "Why can't all men be rich." "Why can't all women be beautiful." "Why can't all children be obedient." "Why can't my bold plate grow any hair. Like seriously I tried everything but it's shinier than a mirror. Omg I don't want to wear that stupid toupee anymore." .... Ignore the last one.
Stellar work as always. Also, has anyone ever told you your wallpaper looks like warhogs looking forward and wombats with their mouths open?
I work for a church that welcomes trans people and I appreciate that this video has been very difficult to make,  but I can assure you that it has help me to deepen my understanding of transgender people.  Many thanks for your effort.
ok, i didnt tear up.  but it was close.  hope you learn to love yourself, you deserve too.  and thanks for doing this.  must have taken a tonne of courage.
this was beautiful
This was beautiful and makes petrified to move forward with becoming myself.
Im fairly conservitive but this was a lovely earnest and honest video. You might not be able to change my opnion on capitalism or free speach but this video has definetly got me thinking. Good job and have a nice day.
Thought I'd switch it off after 5 minutes cause I usually don't watch your videos being linked on destinies reddit. Suddenly I'm after 47 minutes watching you play the piano the fuck.
You ever see the 1977 version of _Suspiria?_ Lighting and use of color. That's why I ask.
This video is too long! I'm getting cranky!!!!!!1!!
Wonderful video!
Well... the "filth" really echoes with me...
Amazing video and I can definitely relate to it. I get paranoid sometimes because you link sexual kinks and sexuality to the desire to transistion and it gets really weird. But once again you debunk bullshit and give us all great information 😄
If only you could have cut out all the bullshit and just presented your arguments.
You're so brave ily
Nat. Jesus christ. this video made my cry with how fucking accurate and validating it is to my own experience. Like this is so spot on I feel like I could have written it myself. That's how universal I think these feelings and experiences are to "cluster b" trans women, but we just cant. fucking. talk about them. Because it's too hard. Thank you for laying yourself so bare. I don't think I've seen anything on youtube so honest and so validating.
we love you Contra.
"Someone please fuck me."  I mean... yes please.
Wow that theory sure sounds like a bunch of Freudianesque claptrap...
ah, blanchard. the og hot taker
ContraPoints keeping me sane in this dark age
my only objection....50 Shades is terrrrrrrrrrrrribly written....garbage.
Always amazing. Thanks , Contra. "Put your hands on your hips!" XD
Oh Contra. I thought you called him a "Cis-hat man" at 10:45 and thought that would a fantastically appropriate term for someone like him.
7:29   lol for the rest of my life, all parentheses will be read in that voice in my head.
You're a beautiful and intelligent person, I'm a trans guy and definitely do not and will not have the same experiences as you but you're really a great role model to queer folk. Thank you for making this video and talking about this topic, it's likely going to save a decent portion of trans women from having to do the same.
um...that cosmo article tho...
OH BOY FUCKEN HERE WE GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I love your videos so much, they're so funny and informative and refreshingly honest. I really admire how clearly you get your thoughts and feelings across, and as a fellow bi its been really rejuvenating and healing to listen to you <3 binging your beautiful videos makes me so happy, keep it up
your song at the end is beautiful.  reminds me of jane sibbery's 'love is everything'
I don't really have much I can say on the subject since I'm a cis-adjacent ish lesbian but this is a great video and it must have taken a lot of  courage to make. You're the reason for the season, mother. All of the seasons.
"more women are into feminizing boys than you might thing" become an mra already
*Peak Trans*
The dislikers strategically made sure this video got 69 dislikes. Well played.
Precious? Are you up there, ya little shit???  Would you fuck me?  Come on, take that bone...Come on. Come on...Come on...Come on.  I'd fuck me so hard...  Edit: Also, I'm at most 363 days older than Contra. Ugh.
I can't forgive you for making me listen to opera.
"I'm pretty sure cis-women don't sleep in a bra" * nervous laughter at my own laziness *
Girl, I love you. When are you going to do an episode on Jordan Peterson? Better yet, debate him live!
I loved this so much!! What a thorough exploration of this topic. Somehow you always manage to be hilarious, intelligent, and intensely personal all at the same time. Thanks Natalie!
Started tearing up when you started singing at the end. Beautiful. :')
I was captivated during this entire video. You merge education and entertainment beautifully. Your entire channel is a godsend and your past videos have changed a lot of my opinions about gender identity.
Oh fuck... I’m just a cishet white guy, but some parts of this video hit *REALLY FUCKING CLOSE* to home. Especially that one comment at 42:00 about identifying as a monstrous caricature of almost everything you hate about yourself.
Love u
This was a great video girl <3.  You're super relatable haha. I appreciate all that you go through emotionally for this!
We love you Contra!  Please don’t forget
OMG Baileys  Give it all up for me, Nads, would you? WOULD YOU?
"Would you fuck me?" Perhaps
#peaktrans but in a good way
A downside to this video for me is that I still have "timber" by coldcut & hexstatic playing in my head after listening to it quite a few times this last week. Fucksaw is not adding too well to the mix   xP
ur discussion abt the differences in ur experience w sexuality before and after transition helped me realize a lot about myself, even though im transitioning in the opposite damn direction. i wish people would be more frank about this kind of stuff, and its really amazing that you were brave enough to put that out there. whatever hate you get for this vid, i hope u know it helped at least one person, even if its a dumbass barely-legal trans dude
This is your best video since you started transitioning. It feels like "Contrapoints," but it also feels fresh and new sometimes. Less forced, more fitting the "new you." Big thumbs up.
I love your work! Your brand of humor is so perfect, and your ability to take complex concepts and make them entertaining is admirable. You are so incredibly talented and I can say without exaggeration that getting the notifications for your videos makes me giddy with excitement because I always know I'm in for some high quality, high concept fun. Also, I need you to make a cover album, thanks.
W A K E  M E  U P
Another fabulous video, Nat!
I really like how much these videos challenge my thinking and my mind. I often replay parts, pause it to think... etc... It’s often a lot to take in. You make it fun and digestible, but it is not overly dumbed down. Thank you for the amazing work you put into this channel.
Contra this is a great video. I genuinely enjoyed watching it as I sat in this hotel room for the past hour(ish). You failed at none of your goals in your pinned comment. I enjoyed the entire video. Thanks for doing what you do.
Lovin' them Peter's docile tones...    ...Make me feel like a virgin, Fucksawed for the very first time. Like a vir-ir-ir-ir-gin...
It is 1:16AM and I have a doctor's appointment at 11:30AM and my roommate is probably wondering when I'll go the fleck to sleep, and I enjoyed all 48 minutes and 54 seconds of this video, dang it!
Is the key part of "forced feminization" fetish that femininity is humiliating? I don't know how I feel about that.
Blanchard and Bailey sounds a lot like Jordan Peterson to me. They're both white, straight, cis, male academics who are "controversial", "anti-PC", "edgy", and people seem to love to talk about them and the controversy they and their theories breed when the reality is that, when their theories are actually put to the test and any amount of academic rigor is applied to them, their theories crumple apart because, despite all of their mystic and their edgy personas, their theories actually aren't all that good and their ideas aren't actually as good as they and their acolytes believe they are. The reason why their theories are so controversial is because they are wrong and have been proven wrong, but they and their acolytes just can't stop insisting that they're right contrary to all scientific evidence.  Also, as a lifelong and devote member of the BDSM community, I find this whole thing not only transphobic, but also that is sounds a lot like kinkshaming, but, then again, I found that kinkshaming isn't exactly uncommon within scientific fields as I discovered during my own education in psychology. The whole thing around "paraphilias" is something that I really hope will be addressed soon within the scientific community because the conversation around it seems quite problematic.  And you're not alone, Nat. I hope that one day someone will find me attractive enough to let me do unspeakable, ungodly things to them. Plus, "Bring Me to Life" seriously gave me immediate flashbacks to 8th grade. :P
There is one major flaw with this theory (at least concerning the "gay men who become women" BS), which is that in what fucking universe are trans women more socially accepted than gay men?
22:00 OK
You’re so smart and beautiful. I’m ace as all hell, but I would love to cuddle with you to help you feel okay. I hope you find (someone or someones) to fill that void for you.
This is truly beautiful. This is truly truly beautiful.
your sound change? you transitioning?
I experience *peak trans* a lot
More than anything, this was incredibly brave.  Good on you Contra.
Natalie; you are so wonderfully intelligent. Though at the time i viewed the debate with Blaire White i took the side of Ms White(& still do), HOWEVER, after watching a handful of your videos it is evident that you are undeniably smart & though I may disagree with some of your points it is also super helpful to listen to you articulate YOUR truths i find myself opening up my mind a bit more!
Hey Natalie is there anything you've done in order to get such a beautiful voice? Like, before your transition even but now I think even more so. Just a little jealous because <3
Worth the wait! You have helped me realize my own sexuality as a woman. I am forever grateful about finding your channel <3
Peter is fabulous at reading. I want him to record audiobooks. 🤣
This is your best video. (Baltimore is second)
I'm a straight kinda ace dude who occaisionally admires my own body, according to Bailey, wouldn't that mean that im like idk an autophallophilliac? That my identification with the male gender is because it turns me on and not because I have some """""genuine""""" reason to be that way.  EDIT: yep, I commented too early, way to go @ContraPoints
Is this too long to be considered a short film?
Natalie, you are raw, you are beautiful, you are an amazing Goddess. Thank you again for all that you choose to share.  You are helping to clarify concepts and bring understanding in such a gentle, dare I say loving?, way. I am 5yrs out of a toxic relationship with feminism, not anti though, more of a dynamic shift and now I am the Dom. And I humbly appreciate your time and thoughts. Sending you all the good things with love n light 💞.
youre badass contra
L O N G B O I S
From what I can make out the brain contains both sexes when it comes to sexuality. Just it seems that some parts are more dominant than others, depending on sexual orientation. This may also be true of gender, but I have found it more difficult to discern. I think gender is more wide ranging into things like metabolism - there are clear differences between males and females in this regard. A large part of being transgender is definately about how the body feels.
oh my glob circa 2014 Frankie Contra is LOVELY!!!
"this videos too long I'm getting cranky"
I'm a trans guy and I found this video incredibly interesting and elucidating. Hearing the perspective of someone transitioning in the other direction helped put some things in perspective for me. I feel like I especially got a lot out of the discussion on female sexuality since that was something I didn't even get when I still identified as female.   Thank you Contrapoints for opening up to us like this and allowing yourself to he vulnerable. It's difficult to gauge how "normative" our personal experiences are compared to other people when they're about a matter so private, so your experiences are valuable to hear. I don't personally think you said anything that was weird or abnormal at all--nothing I can imagine getting Internet rage over.
Wow... This was an extremely powerful video, and you're so extremely brave to put yourself out there and be vulnerable like that. It was so worth the hour of my life, and now I'm more educated on issues trans women face and can work even harder to support trans women, so I'm really grateful for that too. Also, you and your singing voice are beautiful.
..."Someone please fuck me..."  You are the best!  LMFAO!
When I was starting HRT myself around 2004 this steaming pile of shit was all the rage for transphobes. One has to give it to Blanchard and Bailey: they essentially play to trans women's insecurities and the fractious nature of our identities, and pathologize every aspect of *being* a trans woman. There's no escape, no right way. It's a perfect psycho-bomb for others to lob and for us to suffer. The way that I always saw it myself was that OF COURSE imagining or seeing yourself have the body you always wanted to have (but thought impossible) was exciting and sexy. Cis women also find joy in seeing themselves as sexual beings.  By the way, congrats on being full time! Best of luck :)
Here I was, wondering where contrapoints was, only to have her drop a 50 MIN video. As always, super informative video, thank you.
Extremwly good video as always :)
Beautiful
Contra you are great AND gorgeous - I never really investigated this topics (Cis white male with no trans friends) and your videos are so informative and well done - the amount of humanity and vulnerability you've shown are touching, I mean, I don't have the guts to do what you have done here (nor the technical skills and talent of course!) and I almost shed a tear near the end of the video. Please remember that your community loves you (in every possible positive meaning this word has) and you too should love yourself ;)
I really hope there are people who watch this and immediately understand that Contra is trying to dispel a lot of pseudoscience that has permeated how  western media and TERFS view trans women.  Her talking about these things doesn't give it a voice when shows/movies like silence of the lambs and south park have already done way more than a single youtuber ever could.   The implication that the only trans people are trans women who are sex perverts fueled A LOT of confusion and internalized transphobia when i was a teenager. i didn't know i COULD be a trans dude until i was 15 because the only examples i had seen up until that point were fetish-y movies and crude jokes. When you encounter people whose only perception is this type of schlock they short circuit trying to comprehend you and immediately blurt 20 invasive, embarrassing questions. So, I think it's really important to address where these misconceptions and prejudices come from so we can all, trans or not, move on from them.
You're amazing at what you do, Contra. Thank you.
As your voice gets higher, mine gets lower.
Great video! I would have liked to know that the "t-word" was coming, but no harm done.
A friend sent me a link to your piece on violence.  That video and the several afterward were all  fantastic, worth the investment of time and enthusiastically tapping the subscribe button.  This video however came along at just the right time and went a long way to improving my outlook. I can't convey enough how much i needed to hear what you had to say and the good it did.
i started crying at the end of this video thank you for telling your story and know that there are thousands of people who love you.
I'm a straight cis male. And you know what? If I could somehow become a sexy young woman without too much trouble, I'd totally give it a go and indulge in as much lesbian sex as I possibly could. Does that make me an autogynephiliac, and a creepy pervert? Possibly. But I'd be willing to bet a large number of straight cis males would say the same, if they were being honest.  However, as it is I'd make one hell of an ugly woman, and I'm not a huge fan of significant and invasive surgery, so as things stand I wouldn't want to do it, even if it was an option. And I wouldn't want to do something irreversible. But if we lived in some sort of sci fi world where I could effortlessly change into a sexy young woman? Hell yeah! Even if it wasn't reversible I'd give it some serious thought. I don't have any particular issues with the sex of the body I was born into, but nor do I have any particular attachment to it, and its dangly bits. Likewise, nor do I have any strong feeling that I'd be happier in a female body. Basically, to paraphrase Steve Martin, I'd just like to have something to stare at in the mirror. Not exactly a great reason to undergo quite a drastic procedure, but yeah, if it was quick and simple... sure.  I'd like to stress that this is purely my perspective, and I totally accept that different people have wildly different perspectives.
I'll be honest ive never heard of this theory, or maybe i have been exposed to it but never actually introduced to what the hell it is Thank you Natalie
Bailey's is such a mom drink
Pst I sleep with my bra on sometimes out of laziness :3 Fab vid 😚
This is one of your best videos, Nat
Wouldn’t it be funny if Bailey’s one case study with the sex robot was Chrischan?
Even though I outwardly identify as transmasculine most of the time, I've always had a feminine sexual role (for the most part) and I find myself sexy in that context. I also find myself in the category of wanting to be wanted with regards to what I get out of sex and intimacy and HO BOY AM I HAVING RELATIONSHIP TROUBLES THAT INTERACT POORLY WITH THAT SELF-ESTEEM INVOLVEMENT
Solid hermaphroditus joke
holy crap, this is good
Kiwi Farms ... Heh, the Queen is watching ...
This was amazing, loved from start to finish. I'm a trans guy and I relate to so much of how you describe your experience- the idea of developing into a man/woman while it not being a choice to be trans. I just love you so much <3 <3 <3
This video is absolutely brilliant, comprehensive, and thought provoking. There are so many people that need to see this.
Really good video, very thought provoking about a lot of different things. Must have been hard to put all that personal info out there, and it's a shame that it seems almost necessary to do so in order to debate with the theories you're opposing. I've always thought it strange that so many people, at least in my experience, have thought in such a reductive way about trans women as just "guys trying to get into women's bathrooms." To find out that there has been thorough effort to push this theory is troubling, but you've done such a good job breaking it down and giving an opposing viewpoint. I hope more people can begin to think about this topic and others in more broad, inclusive ways, rather than just making assumptions based on their political or social alignment.
You’re brilliant and beautiful but you talk about such heavy shit that sometimes it’s hard to watch your videos.  Thank you though, this is super important
I (a cis female)have slept in bras too Natalie. Sometimes a nice unpadded bralette is what i want to wear to bed. And I have fallen asleep on my own boobs in a push-up bra. It's normal.
ProBleMAtic 😂 this is some good shit right here. Thank you for your honesty and bravery. And thank you for having maintained such a great sense of humor. God. ❤️
Nailing it as always, Natalie. God damn. This is why you're one of my favorite youtubers.
I just found your channel. I love it. Your humor fucking kills me. Rock on.
I could definitely understand why one would be apprehensive about making a video about what might appear to be a niche topic but I think this understanding of the trans people’s motivation occupies a significant portion of the public unconscious, even if they couldn’t articulate it with so many Greek words. It was a really excellent idea to make this video and it was magnificently executed. Thank you thank you thank you for your hard work. You have a beautiful soul and you are four times a lady. 💖💖💖💖
I would whistle at you Contra.  Legit.
18:05 shamelessness is a virtue
The way you describe how you experience your sex drive differently since taking hormones as "coming from a psychologically female place" and "activated by interpersonal connection" as opposed to the "object-oriented male lust" that you were uncomfortable with... It sounds to me like you're saying that men and women do think differently, but that even this is not the source of 'identity', as evidenced by dysphoria being a thing. How does that not support the idea of some kind of "female essence"?
Funny how these myths find their way out into the ethos. Some pervert with a degree writes a book projecting his perversion onto the objects of his perversion, and everybody believes him bc he has a degree. I mean, if I suddenly woke up male, the first thing I'd do would not be penis fondling. I'd do a frikkin handstand, and walk around like that for awhile. I'd do bicep curls with my sofa and get in a bar fight with a rlly big dude  :D  Of all the things on a male body that are more useful than my own endowments, a penis is not even on the list. Transwomen's thinking can't be that different from my own. The transwomen I've met were always more interested in voices and boobies than vaginas. They seem to like curves and softness and comfort more than fumbling around in some wet hole (like men do. UGH.)
Perfect.
Great video (as usual)! One weird thing I wanted to point out: I didn't get a notification  that Contra had uploaded and I have them turned on. Just wanted to point it out in case YouTube is doing something weird!
holy shit  usually when i go to leftist youtube channels i leave some dumbass troll comment that no one responds to but this was a masterpiece
'this one's on the house kiwi farms' lmao
So I spend too much time browsing /lgbt/ and can I just say THANK YOU!  Every day there's 10-15 different threads AGP this HSTS that, Blanchard this.. and now I can just link this video!  Ahh Im so sick and tired of this mindless pseudoscience being used to invalidate transwomen and scare young trans girls into thinking they're just sick fetishists! Its something I struggled with myself for many painful years before coming to terms with my identity and hearing your past experience resonated with me so thank you for sharing.   Your videos keep getting better and better Natalie (and your looks do too) keep it up! Ill be donating to your patreon. <3 <3
30:24 “And I do not want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me” -Contra   “Gentlemen, I must decline your invitation to be a part of your club. I would never be a member of any club that would have me as a member.” -Groucho Marx   I love your sense of humor!!!💖💖💖
I learned a lot about how women look at men
Dammit, I just can't watch this channel for free anymore.
this was amazing
I see thumbnail I click! Milk and cookies close by ready to be enlightened
Natalie this was just so great and insightful.  Please never stop making videos
Videos like this are the reason why this channel is gold. Pure philosophical gold.
You're awesome Contrapoints <3 Love you girl, can't wait to watch this video like three more times to better understand all of that.
44:47 There are some people who claim that transwomen are literally the same as ciswomen and I think it's worth having a nuanced discussion about those distinctions in feminist and activist circles and also in society in general.
congrats on the transition. have a friend who in her 50s started transitioning two years ago... so sympathetic and yeah for you. (yes over supportive saw here)
I'm a man of discerning taste (I also watch MuchDank), and I'd whistle at you and your M O O D L I G H T I N G any day.  Great video, especially the bit at 32:26.
I swear your videos keep getting better and better as you keep getting hotter.
Already watched twice
42:29 It's not the elements of drag and kink that I think are problematic but the ways of presentation that can play into a hyperfeminine or hypersexualized ideal. And I recognize that a good portion of that is internalized misogyny about vanity and resentment of other women that I subconsciously think of as being in competition with me. But I also think there's an element of playing into a comfortable heteronormative ideal that's worth interrogating. I really appreciate you talking about your experiences of trying things out and also maybe having to go a little further to be accepted as a woman. But at some point I wish we could have a deeper conversation about the topic without personal attacks.
Never heard the term "autogynephilia" before, so I just thought it meant the love of one's own vagina.
Thank you for giving us such a raw look at your own experience. 💜  That you can do that while refuting bad "science" in a highly entertaining video is amazing.
So, The Man Who Would Be Queen is basically The Bell Curve regarding Trans-Women!?
@31:12 You said problematic. Unsubscribed!!
Thank you for making this video. Just, thank you.
you made my day! Thank you
48 minutes??! Contra, you're spoiling us!
Great video Contra!!
Contra - you rock, this was really enlightening, please keep doing what you’re doing, you’re a really important voice. That’s all.
I was thinking about your Clusters and tried to imagine which one I fitted into. So I decided to write it down, forming the shape of whatever letter occurred first. But whichever one I wrote gratingly segued between each letter before morphing into some kind of demonic rune while in the distance I heard the sound of a thousand, pained, shrieking crows.  I...  I don't think this video helped.   *sigh*
From one trans woman to another, thank you Natalie  ❤️ 👍
I’m in love with you
29:00 i'm mainly into chicks, but i'm also a fan of the male 'whatever this bit is', inguinal ridge i think
Thank you Contra, for your honesty and for sharing this enlightening video. Your work is always so entertaining and thought provoking.  I may not understand everything you described but your words surely gained me more insight of trans women.
I had to actually pause to get over how hilarious "contrapoints: an erotic life" was. It took me a second to remember the reference but omg, very well done. (I'm not done watching yet but it's wonderful so far ily)
Hey Natalie I'm a mod of /r/contrapoints and if you have a Reddit account and want to be a mod there we would absolutely love to have you. Just send me a message here thanks 😊
Highly informative, hilariously funny (great to see Abigail again LOL!!), and yet another video to help cure my dysmorphia. This is amazing, Natalie! You're fantastic! <3 - Willow, aka Wil
"it's for horseback riding"
Well, I always love your videos, but this was even better than usual. Worth the entire 49 minutes. I really appreciate your vulnerability in this video, and I'm sure many other viewers did too. I know it can kind of suck to put yourself out there like you did, but sometimes it's reassuring to hear that someone else has the same (very private and taboo) experiences that you do. So, uh, thanks!
Autogynephilalisticexpialidocious
I love your videos, this one will take some time for me to understand though, all these complicated english words confused the hell out of me, cheers
Wait, hold up... did you try to sneak in the idea that paraphilias (or "fetishes" in the common parlance) are exclusively (or even mainly) a MALE phenomenon? Because... I think that's probably not the case.
I'm surprised you didn't touch on the studies that compare "autogynephilia" in cis women and trans women. I think they're pretty interesting.  Scott Alexander in the later part of this post gives them a good rundown. http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/15/ozy-a-response-to-spandrell/
Oh God. Please read some pornography for women that isn't 50 Shades. You know, for research purposes. But seriously, any Harlequin paperback is better than that nonsense.
Holy shit I forgot about the fuck saw thing. Hahaha
Are Cher's sex robot videos available anywhere? For research, of course...
Damn I didn't know I needed a phd to watch this video
If there was anyone in this world that I can identify with, it'd have to be you. Glad you're here to make such powerful and supportive arguments.
Applause! This was a great video. Also, I'm a cishet woman and  I sleep in a bra too, because I have unreasonably large breasts.
Wow. This was incredible. You're amazing. I've been watching you for roughly a year and a half. So much has changed for you! It's been so weird and wonderful to follow you through this journey. As you were sorta recapping your experience and showing the old clips and stuff I got emotional and really wanted to give you a hug. The internet is so weird.
I wanted to say that, coming from channels like Blaire White and Sargon, I didn't think I would find entertaining content here. However, I'm glad to see that you are pretty entertaining and have reasonable sounding responses. It's important to respond to ideas intelligently so as to not, at least in some capacity, validate the ideas by responding poorly. Kudos to you for not being the caricature of a leftist, but rather an actual one.
I have to say, your videos seem to get exponentially better every time. Keep doing what you're doing, this community would be nothing without you ;)
I mean, does any point you make require this stereotyping the shit out of female sexuality? I don't want to go into it necessarily, but this whole idea that women's sexuality is about being wanted doesn't play out in boy bands, bishounen, fanfic, any number of venues for female sexuality which present a goddamn catalog of pretty men for female consumption. And it doesn't account for the fact that not being wanted is *fucking terrifying* for women because we are taught that being loved and being worthy as a person is absolutely conditional on our attractiveness and ability to inspire desire.   There's almost nothing in our society quite so pathetic as a woman who is pursuing someone who doesn't want her.   Wanting to be wanted doesn't mean we don't desire ourselves. It means that the only place where our desires have any breathing room are in the context of being desired. This whole assertion that female sexuality is "inwardly focused" and "sexually fluid" and focused solely on romantic context just cultivates an atmosphere where aggressive, active female desired is vilified and monstrous.    Other than that rant though:  I thought that this was beautiful, honest, fair, and forthright, gave a lot to think about, particularly at the end. Thanks for doing this for us, thanks for putting yourself out there, and I feel grateful for it.
Gorgeous video. Wonderfully presented, obviously deeply considered. You’re one of the few honest intellects on YouTube, I don’t know if there’s higher praise than that. Oh wait: Patreoned.   Suggestion for next: transphilia, what’s going on in different types of cis men and cis women who are attracted to trans women or trans women. Is there a taxonomy? Basically all the psychological theories I’ve come across make little sense and meanwhile, legions of fans would love to date you.  Not sure how many would want to date you as you rather than as ‘my trans girlfriend’, but a portion would fall in either group.    Anyway, thank you again Natalie, for this obviously massive project and real service that you’ve done.
Oh, shit, Bailey is the fucksaw guy? What a fucking clown.
I'm not sure if I love 'autogynephilia' being considered a fetish at all frankly, because yeah, a sexuality that reinforces girlhood, who knew that that would be attractive to trans people?   Also tends to ignore the fact that modern conceptions of sexuality are often framed purely in terms of desire and attraction; even the word autophilia kind of reflects that. Like the concept of being sexually satisfied with yourself as a sexual subject needs to be explained through the language of being sexually attracted to yourself. It just feels really incomplete.   But still, retaining the frame of fetish for 'autogynephilia' seems really reductive to me, and only lends power to Blanchard's theories. Contra addresses this to some degree, but she also distances herself from it. Which i can understand but i wish a little more time was spent of separating out sexual attraction, fetishism, sexual subject-hood and transness, which all feel like distinct things to me.
Jesusfuck, your content is top notch.
Holy Jesus Contra, that was an amazing analysis. Not much else I have to say than that was quite a takedown.
Contra you are such a wonderful woman, I hope you achieve everything you want in life, keep the great work.
is it bad that i think the judge lady is sexy?
I'm in heaven.
I related a ton with the ‘erotic life’ section and honestly affirmed my feelings as real.
I wish more people felt safe enough to share their "filth" the same way. Your experiences mirror mine very closely, and honestly I'm so walled-up in my "I'm fine" presentation that it takes effort for me to realize how embarrassing it is to share those kinds of details publicly. I just do it mechanically and then go drink and cry and pretend to myself that it's "existential angst" that's causing me to feel so raw all the time. Thanks for being vulnerable. It matters.
A fascinating and bold treatment—I learned much from this.
I adore the lighting in your videos.
That was surprisingly really useful in understanding frictions in my regular, ordinary CIS relationship. That's a cool (tangential?) discovery.  Thanks.
Nothing gets us hot like context clues mmmm. haha.   Keep going on Contra with the great content. I especially loved your pervert/ scientist reader . I laughed a lot, but it was also informative.
I am so excited for the future video topic that explains the trans perspective without gender essentialism and the feminine essence theory.
I like each new intro better than the last, it makes the videos seem super cinematic in a way you don't see a lot on YouTube
Wow, when did Contra hit 75k?!!!! My secret is getting out. 😞
Saw the length of the video and immediately liked. Halfway through the vid, can I like again?
I had to look up the fuck saw, but I've read the Serano article! Amazing, don't think for one moment that this kind of video will make people see trans lives and experiences as just entertainment. Gonna be here and anywhere for you, for trans men and women, nonbinary people. =8)-DX
I am so psyched to watch this super long video! No such thing as too much Contra in my life.
If you get Abigail Cockbane back again then make her RoboCop.
i love the time warp! i think of you as a woman. i find your voice very soothing too. thank you for this new video contra! i learn so much from you ❤️
17:16 exactly! why would anyone choose the societal torment of transitioning if it was just a weekend sexual thing.
As a cis woman I can 100% tell you I’ve slept in a bra for a similar reason! Never went to bed without one while going through puberty because I was insecure about my flat chest!
Oh my god you r so cool, it's such a geat video, i felt kinda I watched a film by both Tarkovsky and Tarantino (if they became activists suddenly) And actualy I lernt something about my own sexualuty as a sic woman, and surely a hole bunch of things about trans woman, thanks so much for being so god damn cool
HOW are u SO GOOD WITH EDITING VIDEOS and LIGHTING
This was such an amazing video. It was such a great learning experience to hear about the life of a trans woman. I also very much like the alternative to essence theory because I had heard that female and male brains are not sexually dimorphic, and I don't really believe the concept of a female soul. So, this alternative definatly cleared up some misconceptions. Thanks for the great video.
So two transphobes discovered that straight and gay trans women exist, made an immensely transphobic and transmisogynist """theory""", all while conveniently ignoring the existence of the following """theory""" ruining demographics: bisexuals, asexuals, trans men, and nonbinary people.  Great. Just great.
Love your hair. and also I hope the response isn't absolutely worst version of hell
Please don't misuse "triggered" like that, even to mock conservatives.
Fantastic video. Thank you for your incredibly brave vulnerability.
This is great fun to watch while I'm absolutely smashed after a night out and trying to sober up
Autogynephilia is a real thing. But the guys who have it are neither gay nor transgendered. There are lots of guys who are turned on by women and everything associated with them, the clothing and etc. So much so that they like wearing them themselves, fantasize about being a woman and having lesbian sex, and all that sort of thing. But they don't want to live as a woman full time. They only imagine the sex part.  But that doesn't make them transgendered. In truth, this is a very common fetish. But it's not transsexualism. Both they and others may confuse the two, but they are not the same thing.
But now I'm confused. You were saying about how female sexuality is different and you didn't find anyone attractive. So, like, is it normal for women to not find anyone attractive??? Because the past 11 years I thought I was ace. And now I'm confused again.  I guess the important part is that you want someone to fuck you at some point and I don't want that at all???? I don't know, I'm just really confused again.
if I'm ever in a battle royale situation I pray to God that the weapon in my backpack is a fucksaw
For the record, i would quit happily fuck you. But i live in another country. Sorry.
This theory was legit in my undergrad 2nd year psych class on our one class on trans people. It was presented as “fact”. Good to know the history of the theory is as questionable as It’s conclusions. (That class also claimed trans men never were attracted to men...which I already knew wasn’t right because gay trans men exist???)
Zoe blade Killing it again with the music
Natalie you're the best 💗💗💗💗
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
Great Video.  Only wish is that you held up the Golden One as the ultimate autoandrophile.
such a smart video. thanks for making this!
Maybe I have no idea what I'm talking about here, but the way Natalie describes her reaction and experience with 'gender altering' hormones seems to pretty blatantly fall under gender essentialism, as well as how she states she relates to sexual desire before and after the hormones. Before: women's body's were objects. After: it's more about interpersonal relationships- and this is due to hormones specifically, not socialization. Doesn't this simply confirm gender essentialism? So due to hormones people "perceive" and "relate" to others in very specific, gender-cis ways? I'm no academic, but I find that.... Troubling.
Lots of cis women sleep in bras because large breasts are unmanageable without a sleep bra.
Ah science: Where cishet white dudes mansplain everything about everyone else to everyone else, and if you call them out, you're wrong and a liar, because they're cishet white scientist dudes who clearly know more about trans womanhood than you, an actual trans woman. It would be hilarious if it didn't make me want to beat my head against a brick wall.  And I'm actually kind of glad that us nonbinary peeps are out of their purview for now. The last thing I need is for Craigory to come marching in and 'splaining to me that the reason I don't feel like any gender at all is because I'm obsessed with Barbie and Ken's smooth crotches or some shit. (Not that it's great that trans women or anyone at all has to face this shit, mind.)  I mean, I don't understand my gender myself, but that's for me to figure out what's going on in my head or with my body, not for Josh to masturbate to and present it as "science".
You're too good for YouTube seriously. Get out while you can. I didn't understand any of this. Also I'd fuck you. You're the perfect woman for fuck sake.
-10 points for reading 50 shades of grey.
Wait, so this bailey guy... he shits on this “Cher” and calls her “autogynophilic” because she pleasures herself with a sex robot...  Then he builds the sex robot himself, and got a woman to use it publicly in front of his class?  Methinks it wasn’t only the “angular” young girls from Belize that Bailey got turned on by...
Ok. The fucksaw looks good.
44:30 can relate, every goddamn night, just wish someones hand or back was there =(
tl;dr i liked this video.  I've spent a lot of time thinking about my gender identity, and your videos have always been hugely influential for me in that regard. It's surprising (and more than a little frightening) how much I feel myself relating to your journey, and I'm so thankful you've been brave enough to share it.   As a general sidenote, you mentioned peoples perception of trans folk often being painted with this idea that they're all depraved perverts. I think a big part of that is trans people do tend to be more open to fetishism (in my personal experience), but that's only because they naturally spend so much more time considering their sexuality (by virtue of, y'know, being trans) that fetishism becomes an easier topic to consider. It's a similar sort of statistical relationship to how mountain climbers are more likely to break a limb than other people; not because mountain climbers have softer bones, but because they're the ones out climbing fucking mountains, the lunatics.   Also, that laugh you did right at the end was super adorable. <3
Oh god, Peter Coffin reading those excerpts from the text is priceless.
Content warning:  Transphobia  This should be built into browsers to popup every time you open them
Surprised you didn't pull Lacan into this lol
I just came home after an intense week at school and it turns out falling into a wormhole of Contrapoints is a nice way to have a laugh and unwind. (Despite the serious subject matter, you're always funny.) Thanks Natalie, you don't know how bad I needed that this semester.
This theory... is... so confusing. Like how could allosexuals not be turned on at the thought of having sex as the version of themselves they would feel most comfortable as? And if you're pre-transition trans, how could any sexual thoughts casting yourself as your birth-assigned gender be satisfying? If you're a trans woman would it make sense for you to be turned on by the idea of having sex as a man? No, right? You mention in the video that you found it very dysphoric to have ordinary heterosex in the role of a straight man. So if being the wrong gender in sex makes you dysphoric, then imagining yourself as the right gender in sex would be euphoric.  Or do I just not Get It as an ace person.
At least some cis women sleep in bras. I find it more comfortable
Wait wait, I have to go get a drink...........Ok! Go!
GOD, trying to learn to sing again in a different vocal range is SUCH a pain in the ass!
On the one hand I wanna express how I really loved this video but on the other hand I don't wanna express happiness over you sharing or feeling the need to share things you'd rather not share. But, it was amazing <3
I'm sure the validation of  stranger means pretty much nothing to you... But for what it's worth, as a 20yr old bisexual male mathematician/musician who speaks French fluently, I think you're pretty sexy, and if I met you in person I might have to reconsider my decision to be celibate during my university studies. I wish you all the best in your sexual endeavours!
You're making everyone's lives better, and I hope doing so enriches your life and doesn't completely exhaust you. I mean, I am sure it exhausts you, but holy shit you are BRINGING the knowledge.
Absolutely fantastic, and braver than I'm used to seeing in any public forum.  And may I offer a special thank you for spotlighting Alice Dreger's terrible acceptance of the Blanchard model in Galileo's Middle Finger, the book was roundly praised in some of my professional circles, and it helps ease my mind when anyone else points out how uncritically she buys the its false dichotomy. We're talking about a book where she regards a trans academic having photographs of herself on her personal website and wearing of skirts above the knee as damning evidence of her paraphilic narcissism, all while singing the praises of scientists who can look past their personal biases and prejudices... So again, thank you, and great work as always! Well worth the 49-minute time investment!
Lost it at 8:55 XD
Am I the only one that would be slightly happier with slightly less filth? I mean, I have nothing against filth, but this was my reaction when this video posted:   "Ooh, a new video from one of my YouTube smart people... oh, it's Contra. Well, maybe it's like the Baltimore one where it.... nope, it's about transphobia. Can I safely assume it won't involve fetish gear and unspeakable acts involving melons and a speculum? ... no, probably not. *sigh* Guess I'll wait 'til after work..."
This video was incredible! I love all the videos you make because you have a great way of making complex subjects easy to understand.  This was super well written too.  Also great lighting!
Hi ContraPoints! I don't know if you read all comments on your videos, I assume you get a lot of hateful crap so I thought i'd preface my comment by telling you this is going to be about thanking you and how much i've learned and changed since I started watching your videos. My intent with this comment is to be kind and a little gushy and I hope i'm able to convey it well.   I always liked to think that I wasn't a mean or hateful person and that my beliefs and ideals weren't harming anyone and they were pretty liberal in general. I started doubting that though, especially when I went out of my way to learn more about the trans community. I can't remember exactly why I decided I needed to educate myself more, but I did. I learned that my ideas about trans people were hurtful. I didn't intend for them to be hurtful, but do to my ignorance they were just that. That's such a big problem in so many cases, ignorance. I could have continued to remain ignorant about trans people and I would have suffered no consequences for being that way. That scares me. Ever since i've discovered your channel i've been making myself go out of my way to have a better understanding of all different groups of people. I've learned so much and i've changed so much. I'm still learning and still trying to be better. I am sorry I haven't done this sooner. I really am so happy to have found you and your channel. It has led me to all kinds of amazing people in all kinds of communities.   I adore your work! Your content is beautifully made and the information in your videos is well researched and fascinating. I always learn something new. I can't wait to see where you go from here and i'll will be a long time fan. Seriously, thank you. You've made a huge difference in my life and the way I understand things.
the style and the arguments are so on point 👌👌👌
Fuck man! When you gonna do a needle point vid!
You are a brave, and you are beautiful. You are an intellectual, and you are a woman. You don't need my, or any others', validation. This is just how I see you. Keep up the absolutely phenomenal work, my most beautiful sister, and soon we shall return to the moon-drenched shores of our beloved planet ... And our world will do the Time Warp, again!
Your smile was so cute when you laughed ☺️
@ 22:03 YES. YES I will  <3
I googled the fuck saw incident. aaaaannnd....I feel like just this once...conservatives might have a point. lol  seriously Bailey...keep it in your basement or for sex parties.  not a classroom.
Came for the Sex Robot, left with a strange desire to conduct serious clinical research.  In Fishnets.  PROOOBLEEEMAAAATIC
@ 44:54  that is a big problem on our side, and it transcends gender and race.  its the "you haven't had x oppression...so FUCK YOU."  You are trying to understand the problems other genders and/or races are facing, you're told you NEED to understand it ...but you're told you can't understand it and you never will. .  its in impossible situation, and it only strengthens our opposition by giving them an easy win. yes, Contra hasnt experienced the oppression of women, straights havent experienced the oppression of homosexuals, whites to blacks, etc, etc.  This doesnt mean we can't try to understand each other while work together toward common goals, and that's what really matters.  Please tell people who act like that to 'piss off'
14:48 I was waiting for that
I never understood why Blanchard was such on expert on Women, when he clearly isn't one or doesn't seem to care for them other than being sexual fetishes? Hey, wait a minute. That it. He has fantasies about us.  So he is a tranny chaser with a platform?
I'm trans male, and your "trans experience" is pretty similar to mine, in some ways. True, there are some differences but there's a lot of overlap on the Venn.
This is a fantastic video, and by far one of the best explanations I’ve come across about what it means to be trans.
Your content is amazing, and your colour grading is enviable...
Honestly, this video really helped me understand my own sexuality better, despite being a cis female. I always had a hard time accepting that my attraction to women was real because the only way that I thought people could be attracted to women was in the way that cis men are.
I love this cause I love psychology. a video that focuses on trans psychology is awesome.
I've seen TERFS use the term "Autogynephilia" and even when i looked it up I wasn't able to understand what the heck they were talking about. Thanks for breaking it down and in particular pointing out how P R O B L I M A T I C and harmful academics can be.
“Sometimes you have to explain what it means to be trans to someone who believes that dogs go to heaven.” Oh lord, you’re my queen
Even if I were to treat this guys anecdotal observations as valid, they seem backwards to me.  It seems more likely to me that the sexual aspects of Tran's people he observed are more reflective of their need to express themselves, as opposed to the transitioning reflecting their sexual life.  People's sex lives are determined based on who they are, rather then who they are being defined by their sex life.   What type of freak **doesn't** express themselves or their interest in their sex life?  Does he believe that nothing but soulless, dead-eyed missionary sex is some kind of perversion that needs explanation?    This guys reasoning could be used to justify almost every human behavior as some type of fetishes.    "I've noticed that people who have candles around often lite them before sexual intercourse.  The only explanation I can find for this is that the purchasing of candles is to satisfy their inner most sexual desires: That is to say, a deep underlying wax fetish.  These individuals find the melting of wax to be highly erotic, likely due to the fact that this process revolves around the creation of a fluid (that is to say, melted wax).  Every person who buys candles is a part of this weird fetishistic cult, and those who deny that the basis for purchasing candles is for sexual satisfaction is a lying pervert." - Blanchard, probably.
Masterful, as always.
I always look forward to your videos. I find your honesty inspiring, and your singing voice is so beautiful.
You're a champion, Natalie.
This was amazing. Thank you for being so open!
cis woman here. i sleep in a bra because im too lazy to take it off. im also an a cup.
I love the video, but the music in it kind of pisses me off for some reason.
At the end, you mentioned you imagine a lot of cis people will congratulate you for being so calm and reasonable for talking about your own experiences. There is that, and it is a damn shame so many trans women are expected by doubters to basically put themselves on public trial to satisfy those who would point fingers at their identity. However, congratulations should be given to you for being one brave soul.   It takes a goddamn lot for a person to pour out their most personal truths when speaking to a therapist. To do it for all to see? Wow. I've always admired the way you put yourself out there with every video in the hope of engagement and debate but every part of this video must have been really difficult to do (especially the interview and trial parts). With the inevitable criticism and attacks that will go your way for making this video, I hope those people will at least recognise the effort and sheer will it took for you to do this. And that they respect you for it. Because Natalie, you certainly have my respect. What a video.
oh man i thought this was gonna be a breakthrough for abigail
These are my favourite degenerate things.
Thanks, Nat!
12:45 Acting like you don't know why trans people on the internet get angry at you even though they've explained it clearly many times is a lil disingenuous
What's with this channel's obsession with electronic versions of classical music? I'm not saying I dislike it, it's pretty neat, I just wonder what the deal is.
autogynephilia was literally my first exposure to any kind of discourse about trans people. I'd guess that added at least a year to my denial about my gender.
this is exactly what i need, thank you <3 keep up the good work
i am so glad my sexuality and gender is easy to understand. I'm a guy and I just like that cis pussy. However it is interesting to hear your story and other people from the LGBT community tell their story.
Beautiful! Brilliant! Encore!
you get prettier with every video!
Sounds like The Man Who Would Be Queen's author was the one satisfying their masturbatory urge, filthy science gets him hot and bothered.
watching contra as a trans woman means laughing at one sentence and crying at the next
Wow, thanks for sharing and thanks for the excellent video.
Ilysm Natalie!!!! Thanks for this awesome video!
Autogynephiles do exist and they are perverts, but not all trans women, or even non-straight trans women, are autogynephiles.
Thanks! Great as usual!!!
This is possibly the bravest video I've ever seen on the internet.  I would never dare to admit that I read Fifty Shades of Grey.
I fucking love you so much. I only discovered your channel about two months ago, but you've quickly become my favorite youtuber. I love your honesty about your personal experiences, your intelligent arguments and responses, and your humor. You're amazing and I love who you are, please never stop being your badass self ❤️
These assholes caused me so much pain and wasted time. I love you for making this.
29:55 I just realized how weird proper books sound to me lately. I don't think I've read a proper fiction book in months, mostly screenplays, so all that description sounds like a really long stage direction to me.
*Intersectionality intensifies*
14:11 actually... i DID come here hoping for science, i only made it half way through Serano's paper because i'm a slow reader with a rubbish attention span... i was kinda hoping you'd fill me in on the rest. But filth is good too...
Natalie, you're an intelligent, talented, soulful, and stunning lady, and I, for one among likely dozens, would treasure you in a relationship. I don't think you'll have any problems finding someone who will validate you as a woman while building a deep emotional bond with you.  But I know how it is to doubt yourself and pick at the imperfections that are so large for you and small for everyone else, and the doubt when those imperfections aren't acknowledged.  Low self-esteem throttles praise and clouds objectivity.  I have no idea if you'll see this, or if it won't come off as creepy, but honestly, you deserve a lot more credit than I think you give yourself.  Thank you for doing what you do.
lmao how can anyone believe this "theory"? It's the most half assed thing I've seen that has like no "SCIENCE" tm behind it. Someone has really got to clear out my field. Like also who the fuck is going to listen to white men on this shit.
Bravo! Excellent video. You really put a lot of yourself into this one and I appreciate it. And I appreciate you.
The intro is so cool! Also did you do something with your voice? It sounds higher. Nice
ContraPoints is a force that will not be stopped!
This video was incredible!
"I didn't masturbate until I was 15"  Is...is that not normal?
48 minutes? I feel so blessed
What a fantastic video, as your average cis guy this has been incredibly interesting and enlightening. Fantastic videos as always, it makes me so happy to see how many patrons you have now - you used to be able to say them all in 30 seconds and now look at it. Much love <3
The ending seriously had me in tears. Also god damn, you're cute
I think this is a video that I've learned a lot from, not just about autogynephilia and how bs it is, but about human sexual interaction and the different views and norms between men and women. As a 20 year old white cis man in college, you can imagine that I've probably not thought about how women view themselves sexually, and I do have some habits of assumption that I want to rid myself of. This video has made me realize that women are not like men when it comes to sexuality. It feels obvious now with everything you said, but it's something that had never even crossed my mind before. As what I am, it is hard to see things from a perspective that is so far removed from own, but there is one confession that you brought up that I find I I feel very similarly with. It isn't so much the sexual attractiveness of the person that I enjoy, it's the person themselves.  Now this comes from a guy that has never actually been in a relationship, but my view of them does tend to be very platonic by nature rather than sexual. I honestly find it strange that two people who nothing virtually nothing about each other can start dating after meeting once or twice. I can't really find myself attracted to someone in the sense that I want date them and be with them unless I've known them for months or years. I become invested in the person rather than their physical body and level of subjective attractiveness.   All of this feels very strange to admit, especially here of all places, but I really thank you for this video. It has gotten me to think about some things that I've never really considered before. Again, thank you. You've done a very good job with this video, and I appreciate you being able to be so open with us. I know this rant has been about more of a side note for this video, but it is the part that resonated with me. Now I'm going leave this here before I drag this out into an essay.
You're insanely talented.
you are looking very well, great video not much else to say really save that your videos have been of great relief to me no matter what anyone says you keep doing what you are doing. Ps my favourite rocky song is wild and untamed thing.
Damn, the quality of your videos keeps getting better
I'm a trans man and i sleep in a bra¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Oh man, I’ve missed that good contrapoints content
So have you changed your preferred pronouns to only she/her now?
When COntra said "fuck saw incident", I imagine two guys using an old timey cross cut log saw that had little dildos on the blade instead of metal teeth, and a lady is there spread eagle with the guys heave ho'ing it back and forth across her.   I was kinda disappointed to find out it was just a sawzall with a dildo strapped to the end. Oh well, can't win them all
i don't buy your cluster A and B. Stats or it didn't happen. It wouldn't be THAT hard to quantify (except the childhood bit). i think that section should maybe have been on confirmation bias.   even IF there is a correlation between sexual orientation and transition age, that would almost certainly be due to external social pressure from heteronormative society.    none of the trans women i know fit that dichotomy, unless maybe they're all your group B,  but they all transitioned in or near their 20s, is that "early" or "late"?
Absolutely wonderful. I'm really inspired by how much you put yourself out there. I hope this will help all kinds of people understand trans people better. My only, minor criticism is that you kinda use dysphoria as "the trans maker" when we're still all over the place about how trans people know they're trans? Other than that I think the vid was probably perfect. The ending song made me cry actually?? Since you describe listening to it as the only time you really feel like a woman. I know this is just a tiny glimpse into your life but I was still moved, pixar style.
I love all of your content!  Will you consider doing a video on the Jordan Peterson phenomenon?
I actually learned a lot, here.  Thank you, madam.
As a tronz wormzans I have to say this vide is grate. But part of me as a like 10 year odd old hand at tranzing feels some bits were missed but it's probably just things you don't know about yet.
"it's not that there is no objective truth, it's just that this *you hold up book* represents a very narrow window on it". But, if it is as you say, then it doesn't represent much of a window on it at all, surely? I mean, just as bad theories about trans people do not hold up as legitimate, constitutive avenues of understanding towards trans people, bad science doesn't discredit science. It just affirms the need for good science. I realise you're not explicitly saying that (so far, at least - I'm commenting on the fly) but the very point of science is, with enough time in play, to transcend individual bias and perspective.
Hey! We are on the same dosage! Go get them Contra! Also I would totally fuck you!
how can u be so talented jfc
I wonder how they view Trans men that crossdress.
Reddit crew W^?
So at the part where you explained how you no longer become turned on by just the visual image of a woman, Which made me question myself quite deeply. I'm a cis bisexual woman who's attracted to womens bodies so much so my own body (not my face or myself) but just my body is a turn on. I think women are just inherently more attractive and appealing so I find myself able to have casual sex with women whilst with men I've almost always exclusively been demisexual with. So my sexual attraction to men only happens AFTER I get to know them but I can be sexually attracted to a woman from the get go?
A masterpiece from Contrapoints
love this video, love the editing, your humour, all. and your voice training is going so well!! you're doing amazing sweetie!!
Amazing video as always, Contra!
ahm, i know you don't read these. but, thanks. thanks for taking one for the team.
Love you <3
I have learned more on this channel than all other places combined. Very well done.
Not enough baby drowning or milk baths. 4/10 worse one yet, only saved by the classical music and filth.
Thanks for the excellent video! I'm transmasc so my experience is vastly different, but I'll say a few things: I feel the same sexual feeling opposite, about wanting to not be seen as a woman, about corresponding more to male patterns of sexuality, as well as growing up not typically masculine OR feminine. Thanks so much for an excellent deconstruction.
Fantastic. This video has made me realize how much you and a couple others are really contributing value to my life, so I'm finally doing the right thing and setting up regular donations to you, Lindsay, and Shaun.
Your voice is so lovely. Thank you for all the time you put in and for sharing so much knowledge and thought provoking video entertainment. You've helped my progression by making me thinking about and facing my own dysphoria as a trans man, progressing my transition and giving me confidence to pursue it heavily as I have watched your content.  Thank you.
Well im going to have to rethink some things about myself, like you sounded my asexual in your childhood than me, a self identified asexual.
Contra, you're an inspiration. Please know that you have an audience that you honestly help understand a lot of things about the world and the "trans perspective" in particular. I'd be a shittier person without you.   Really looking forward to your upcoming videos.
Natalie, you're worth watching for any amount of minutes.
To be fair, the thought of being freed of cismale sexual desire sounds fantastic
What a beautiful video. I specialy liked the talk about fetish. What turns people on and the differences across different sexual orientation and genres is something pretty interesting. It is a shame that these topics, relaying a lot on talking about personal things that we are taught to believe weird and wrong are not often discuss in a profound way.
You cite terfs to a t. They all say the same thing.  I've been called that word before I even knew what it meant, if it is a fetish, then I must have had this fetish every since I was born and must want to live this fetish 24 /7
"I find out later that she is from Belize" lmao you owe me a new monitor after that voice over that was gold. Next time I need to make sure I'm not drinking while watching your videos :P
Cracking video! I throughly enjoyed it. I've always admired you, even early back in the cringe-atheist days. Keep up the great work. Mwah X
Zoë Blades music is just perfect for your videos in general, and "Knighttime" in particular is a masterpiece.
Grasping for words, as they will be lost in a sea of comments if I just wait an hour, just this: knowing I don't know you, but knowing *of* the woman behind and infront the camera, the bravery of your work is obvious not only in the theory you so carefully dismantle here. Thank you for that. As PhilosophyTube put it so well: godsspeed on your gender journey. Additionally I just wish us all political solidarity whenever it is needed, because I think God will not suffice.
Clusterfuck?
Has anyone else ever noticed the only time women are more represented than men it's because their trans women so much of society views them as men? It's absolutely terrible. People should just be represented equally and society needs to realize that trans women are just women and that trans men are just men. Ugh I hate the world.
Also more super long videos please!!
Thank you for posting this video, you’re amazing and it’s so helpful to have your experience and opinions
Only halfway through but thank you so much for your videos - I've loved them from the start but lately you are so constantly on point i can't believe it.  I really liked the description of different sexual response for female hormones...i think because cis men are seen as default and so is their sexuality it has really hurt me in terms of sexual self image. Partners have insisted i don't like sex or have no sex drive because i am almost exclusively turned on by the "interpersonal connection" thing. I hate almost all porn because this is lacking and is purely visual with little to no connection between the actors. The only stuff i enjoy is made by other women and involves a lot of "story" and very contrived situations!   You're the best!!!
I must say, this video is truly excellent, even better than your Alt-right analysis. As someone who has limited knowledge on transgender issues I learned a great deal.
THIS WAS SO GREAT!!
16:27 "Future Video Topic" ...yeh. One has kind of gone down that road. Taken a few years. But basically comes back to politics. It does mean though that (providing the light speed of the spectacle doesn't take over the discourse - I'm sure you know about this kind of really a lot) you can quite easily refute claims by people such as Ben Shapiro on their own terms. I'm a nerd anyway - getting into stuff like "Intergrated Information Theories of Consciousness" etc or weighing up quantum theories of consciousness versus emergent theories of conscious. Synchronous brainwave activity and learning - all that kind of stuff. It all comes back to the humanities (politics) in the end as we don't have microchips for brains (because that would not be an Intergrated feedback but instead a parallel/series feedforward system). Not a total waste of time. e.g. My brief theory for James Mensell's "Under the Bed" horror short: -  1) simplest way of telling what is happening is that the kid on the bed is the real kid while the kid under the bed is not the real kid. Could be many reasons why? - e.g. the kid under the bed is a monster, or, the kid on the bed somehow manifested their subconscious fears to bring a real monster under the bed into reality?...   The short in a sense could be satirising the latter option...   possibly even showning the limitations of the dad's imagination? 2) more complicated is if the kid under the bed is real (and I think this is the more interesting interpretation). So the real kid got a scare for some reason - and went to hide under his bed. Then whatever scared him came into his room and went onto his bed. Many interpretations here: -              - from the father's perspective. Both kids could be in his subconscious - he feels creepy going into his son's bedroom while he is asleep. Possibly he is dealing with the discomfort of his own "inner child" (to use psycho-therapy terminology). The expectation of what he should do is represented by the child on the bed, but how he feels is represented by the child under the bed.             - from the kid's perspective. Basically the same as with the father above. He wants to be under the bed when his father comes in - he feels that, even though he is awake, that he should full fill expectations of the ideal sleeping child for his father... and doesn't feel he lives up to that. 3) It is basically about how while we are asleep we dis-engage the frontal lobes of our brain - the mid part of our brain is still active (the emotion part) during R.E.M. sleep, which is why dreams never make sense (like this short). Because we are unable to think about them rationally - as engaging our frontal lobes would wake us up (as this stimulates dopamine production and produces alertness). But also while in deep sleep, all the parts of our brains become disconnected (like the identities of the people in the short?) - we loose consciousness...  we effectively no longer exist during deep sleep. Every time we sleep, we die...  and we can't help wondering that maybe our waking selves is in some sense a lie? 4) The kid on the bed is a Lobster.
I'm a cis woman who has constantly slept in my bra. I love my tits, but I hate how they feel against my ribcage. Need that separation. *shudder*
As a trans dude (with no access to transitioning anything lmao go poverty), I appreciate your courage and you as a person. Keep fighting the good fight and I hope us trans men and my nonbinary kin can share a beer with our trans sisters and not have to worry about fucking idiots and terfs being up in anyone’s face about shit no one should have to put up with.
48 minutes my body is ready
Holy shit contra, 50 minutes? Are you planning on making a TV doc for discovery channel?
"Great title. Very provocative, very controversial, very politically incorrect. I have been triggered. Well done" --- I'm going to start saying that.
Entertaining as usual. Didn't feel like 50 min.  Your explanations where all over the place and unelucidating ( is that a word?)  but Blanchard's are certainly flawed. The subject remains murky and will continue to perplex people. I'm betting on emotional injury as trigger and cause.
I've been blessed for a whole 50 minutes
thanks for taking one for the team Natalie. This is a much needed conversation and I agree the damage is done so this needs to be addressed. As for gender essentialism that is something I kind of agree with on a gut level but admittedly is not something I have done enough soul searching or research on. Do you have any recomendations for reading on that topic. Also do you have any plans to make a video fuether explaining your thoughts on gender essentialism? Also liked where you explained why it is hard for trans people to talk about this. If see people can ask a trans person to be patient with them it is only fair that we can ask cis people to do the same.
Seriously appreciated this video.  Thanks for sharing.  You make new fans every day with your perspective...  Even shitlords like us.
Contra, thank you so much for doing this, you've educated me on 2 entire fields I had no idea about. Godspeed my queen :)
just fyi, as an afab person, i have slept in a bra multiple times. i mean, sometimes it's late and you're tired and getting off a bra when you have 42 DD breasts is like removing plate mail and you don't wanna put up with that shit, so you just... don't. other than that, A+++ video and i love you so much.
Fucking slay him queen!!!  god damn love this video, though as a....pan? white guy i know that this video isn't aimed at me, but nevertheless i really enjoyed watching. Keep doing what you're doing Natalie, give 'em hell
A prosecutor with a riding crop... Is Abigail Franziska von Karma?
I love this and all the work you put into these videos! this chanel is one of the greatest. keep it up
first of all, awesome video, as always. I also just wanted to put my perspective out there. as someone with mainly estrogen in their body, can I just say that I align much more closely with what you call the "male" side of "normal sexual behavior" and I don't have high testosterone (it's been checked) So, please be careful when you talk about gendered sexuality. Not everyone has that same experience, and it can vary widely. A lot of it is social and that's fine but it has to be acknowledged.
Also, honestly, we should be celebrating Cher the sex-bot maker. What a brave pioneer
You are supposed to be doing what you are doing.
Seeing 14 year old goth Abigail made my day even though she's the worst.
This was so amazing in all sorts of ways. I'm glad you brought up why transwomen are often reluctant to engage in "rational debate" about autogynephilia in the end. Not to sound too philosophical but it's their very being that's at stake there, and it's ridiculous to expect transwomen to talk about it as if it was some abstract philosophical problem.  I'm kind of curious about one thing though. Seeing that you give a whole lot of weight on hormonal differences when it comes to male and female sexuality, are you then saying that the so called "male gaze" is biological in origin? Because if testosterone is likely to get you turned on by visual cues and make you prone to fetishistic sexual objectification, one could make that argument.
What a video! This one will stick with me. Makes me pissed at that Blanchard for projecting his genderbend fetish on transwomen. I find it especially irritating cause I'm the type of man who likes crossdressing and feminine things, yet there's no way I'm a transwoman. I love seeing the mixture of gender, and how androgynous I can make myself look (not always in a perverted way). I feel wrong if people misgender me as female, and even grew a beard for that to stop.  It's just irritating when people who know nothing about how you feel come and tell you "what you really are". Naturally I have much less to lose in a discussion like that than you transwomen do. I feel for you a lot, and will always take your side!
I’m a trans man who was sitting back sipping on water when you said I could do just that (but with a beer).
Wow, i genuinly was  not expecting this. I felt a twinge of sadness for you when you said your not happy with yourself at the end, but i hope that eventually passes, because there a multitudes of people that are absolutly in love with you. Second, I am continually astounded by the sheer aesthetic beauty that you have culitivated for your productions and I wish that i could immediatly see what it will lead too.
i love u thank u
your sexual history kind of strikes deep in my soul because holy shit do I identify a lot with all of that.  personally, I don't want to transition for masturbatory purposes, but i don't feel secure in this body. There's a raw confidence I feel when i look in the mirror and see a cute woman rather than a really femme dude. Would I fuck me? sure. But the feeling of confidence and security are way more important than the fucking.
"Bailey, you just found... you just found a person who built a sex robot!" This part had me laughing, what the fuck is wrong with these god damn transphobes
back to back shaun and contra?!
Thank you. It's gold, as always <3
How can a theory that involves dismissing 90% of what the target group says be even remotely scientific?
I just want you to know that you're a rally smart, funny and compassionate video maker and I hope your life gets happier. It makes me sad that you hate yourself and I hope you are okay.
I was born * a fucking baby *  lol i love that
"Oh hell yeah it's a new ContraPoints video..."  "Oh FUCK YEAH it's 49 minutes long!"
I should dig up my old Rocky Horror pictures... haha, thank god I grew up before the digital age.  this was brilliant! thanks for being so open about your experience. you are an incredible woman and beyond loveable.   loved hearing Peter on the track too hah
So, as a trans woman, I'm actually really happy to hear you talking about how you don't buy into the essentialist rhetoric about being female from birth to death.  I totally feel that way too, and it's kind of a controversial position to hold, because a lot of trans people feel like the idea that they don't have anything inside them that validates their feelings, by necessity, invalidates their feelings.  So it's a difficult position to have and to discuss, when it sort of causes existential crisis in a lot of people who rely on that view as a justification for their dysphoria and pain.
Queen! 👑❤
RE: no women experience autogynephilia point – I am a straightish cis woman who is also very masculine in many ways. Despite me being comfortable with my gender expression I find it uncomfortable in my relations with straight men, where I feel I will never be feminine and desirable in an authentic way (I understand this is all pretty P R O B L E M A T I C). So I think I feel some sense of autogynephilia when I am around/fucking really masculine dominant men because it alleviates this discomfort by making me and my experience of my body feel fleetingly very feminine, in the same way Bailey talks about bi trans women fucking men because it makes them feel feminine. Just for the record.
<3
THE PIRATE SHOT!!! Yeesh!
This theory is spammed all over 4chan's /LGBT/
You should do a video on the state of the union adress
I think Blanchard may have had  vagina envy.
Thanks Contrapoints! Thanks for bringing this subject in a comprehensible manner (I am an academic, but that hasn't prepared me for Judith Butler jargon on the matter! This video has giving me a lot to think about.
Contra, I hesitate to call myself a transwoman because of how much I dislike the feminine essence theory. And it's for exactly the reasons you stated. I've had a very similar experience to yours. All I can say is that this feminine, once-male-bodied queer agrees with almost everything you say and loves the way you present it. Also: You're beautiful and I love you.
Thank you.
Marry me Contra and we can raise confused children together.
Thank you for a wonderful video that touches on so much. As someone genderqueer it actually gave me a few new leads to follow in my quest to figure out what the hell I am.  You’re amazing. Every time you doubt that just remember this one YouTube comment. :)
Thank you for sharing your story.
philia is not a suffix n00b
You are up there in the ranks of intelligent and provocative women making content on YouTube.  Thanks for approaching this with openness and honesty; we probably don't deserve it, especially considering the potential backlash you might receive.
part seven of this video is something thats been bothering me ever since i was made aware of the whole "autogynephilia" thing. like, even if some people get turned on by themselves in some way... so what??? who does it hurt???? yet another awesome video, of course x
To be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles, And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep No more; and by a sleep, to say we end the heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks that Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep, To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there's the rub, for in that sleep of death, what dreams may come, when we have shuffled off this mortal coil, must give us pause. [citation required!]
I am not Trans but at 45 minutes, things about defensiveness and self loathing really were relatable. I can see how they are also used to craft that calm analytical persona that is so prized.  The reminder about why it is humiliating and infuriating really is needed for us cis folks, in all honesty, and it is also sometimes necessary to remind those crafting those unemotional facades that it is okay to feel when you are trying to figure yourself out while fighting those that try to steal your shine.
This is why your videos are superior to those of our mutual hypermasculine headache The Golden One... you're actually a three-dimensional human being underneath all the makeup and staging and clever editing and David Lynch-inspired trippy visuals. Lord Goldiemort not only shows an inferior skill at editing and visuals, he's NEVER this candid about his backstory... offering only empty, grade-school "Hero's Journey" platitudes that tell us absolutely NOTHING of his past, his motivations, his character or why he does what he does. Instead of offering us a glimpse at his true self, he presents us with a MASK- a hollow, empty shell meant to evoke images of Greek gods, legendary Norse warriors and a bunch of High Fantasy bullshit that would be considered blunt and on-the-nose in a Frank Frazetta or Boris Vallejo painting. And behind that mask, a terrified little boy who thinks "Real Men" only come in one flavor- broken, damaged, savage White Nationalists who look like they leaped fully-formed from a Frank Miller graphic-novel.  So keep fighting the good fight, sister. You're good people... unlike The Super Saiyan Swedish Meatball. The more I watch his content, the less I like that mincing fantasy-dork who hit the weight-room and the steroid-needle before a donkey kicked him in the back of the head.
You are Beautiful and amazing and i LOVE you
About the "perfect theory that can't be proved wrong" ; that's actually a known major red flag in all scientific fields. Typically, a theoretical system that have no imaginable way to be proved wrong is considered 1) intentionally built like this to avoid due discredit to the original theory and 2) therefore theoretically unsound ; a theory can only exist (and be right or wrong) in a system that includes possible ways to find a counter-example. That's the whole point of the expression "not even wrong" ; it doesn't even have what it takes to be analyzed and tested to be later declared right or wrong. It's something else masquerading as a theory.  Notable examples of this old fashioned trick include a lot of Freudian theory ("gay men want to fuck their dad because they were raised without him, and if they say they don't they're just lying !"), or Sartre's whole idea of mauvaise foi ("well, sounds an awful lot like what a X would say to me"). It's a manufactured logic loop that can't be directly exposed, but anything you deduce from it is also... a similar loop. It's theoretically sterile and scientists across the board should cut that shit out like, yesterday.
Nearly every aspect of your background and experience mirrors my own. Thank you for being brave and exposing all the complex details of what really motivates some of us to transition. And doing it in such an entertaining and non-preachy way, as always. You keep doing you, because you're awesome! I'm sure you ultimately change at least a few hearts and minds, and that's what it's all about, neh?
Holy fuck this is oversharing.
Hoo boy, 49 minutes of Lol I relate to this I want to die. 4 times a man 1 time a lady, Never since hormones. And, another funny thing about Blanchard I've never seen is the discussion about mental health and self loathing anguish. Video topic, live stream cue? I'm not sure.
Holy crap.  I accidentally watched the whole thing in one sitting.
Bravo Natalie!  You've shown great courage and great wisdom in this video.  It was very informative, very insightful, and very, very entertaining.  Thank you so much for making it.  You're beautiful in every way.
Stands up and claps.  You put into words how maze mind fuckery the AGP quackery can be.
You are so great <3 Truly, thank you so so much for this, makes me so emotional and nostalgic like I just want to hug you and comfort you, if you ever came to Sweden I'd totally give you a kiss <3 <3
D O T H  T H O U  B L E E D ?
I freakin' love you.
So does all your patreon money go toward buying outfits and props for your characters or just most of it?
I really like the lighting at 24:52 and 26:13 !
This was another great video, Contra! Thank you so much for your content. You've been part of my experience of realizing and actualizing my nonbinary existence. Much love! <3
All you bitches bitching about the video length really need to up your stamina game.  Could relate to a lot of your history video Nat, most of it's really familiar except the cross-dressing stuff. Also if you ever come to Australia I'll help you on that 22-minute request.  (Yeah I know she's not reading and even if she did it'd be just another internet weirdo LET A GIRL DREAM OKAY)
I didn't think I would but I watched this whole video in one sitting. I found it very compelling and only felt the need to pause it so I could laugh out loud without missing anything. I found this video very educational and I really appreciate you sharing your perspective and personal experiences :)
WELL ACTUALLY... some cis women do sleep in their bras. Usually the well endowed ones. So uh, not me. Also, I hope you are suggesting dogs don't go to heaven because it doesn't exist, not because they wouldn't be allowed or because they have no souls.
That was amazing Contra.
This was both incredibly brave of you and incredibly well done, even compared to the high standards set by your other videos. You're fucking amazing, Contra.  Also seeing and hearing you pre-transition gave me whiplash. It's like night and day.
This is an amazing video. Fabulous.
you are amazing!
omg Peter Coffin needs to read adult audiobook now. That was hilarious.
I was kind of hoping you'd discuss the paper that was a refutation of autogynephilia. I'd love to hear your summarization as I'm sure many others would. Not to mention, many academic papers are behind pay walls that can't be accessed freely without university affiliation or deep pockets.
excelente video Contra, saludos desde Chile :)
You do such a good job at making thorough arguments that keep your audience in mind!! Keep up the good work
Omg! CONTRA YOUR SINGING VOICE IS REALLY GOOD!
Great video Natalie, thanks for addressing this subject. I'm a trans woman myself and I know well how exhausting it is to put this argument to rest, which is unfortunate considering how often it is thrown around by our detractors. I hope this silences them, considering the lengths you went through, but I know it won't. It's never enough for some people. 😓
I used to wear my bras to bed all the time until other cis women told me it was weird, supposed to be uncomfortable, and wrong for the  body.  Now my tits sag and bras feel abnromal to wear. I should have stuck to what felt right for my  body, damn it. Excuse me while I have a funeral for my sad tits.
Dude just try to be a dude again you make a super attractive dude but a hideous girl
Great Reddit reply on trans women having to have thick skin or be offended: https://np.reddit.com/r/ComedyCemetery/comments/751xbh/gendurr/do376mi/  Can I be straight with you for a second? You seem like a lovely person and I agree with everything you said, and you seem like you care, so I want you to understand how that statement might come across to trans people reading it.  When you say that the trans people you know were great, but that people who criticized you were unreasonable and oversensitive, you create this dichotomy where, in order to be a good trans person, you’re not allowed to get offended by anything, lest you be seen as one of the crazy ones. It’s like we always start off with something to prove, because everybody thinks we’re combustible and they’re waiting for us to encounter the tiniest obstacle and then explode.  And I’m certain you didn’t mean it this way, because I’ve been torn apart by zealots for unreasonable shit too. Some people are actually thin-skinned and take it way too far, like the women you mentioned, and I certainly know those people exist. We all do. But the point is, I have no idea what your threshold for “unreasonable” is. When people are primed to think we’re crazy, the slightest display of human emotion will cause people to see us that way.  There are a lot of people who legitimately hate us, and who will go out of their way to make our lives hell. There are a lot of real things that trans people experience that any normal human being would be “offended” by. Comics like this portray us as crazy by pretending that the extent of our problems is people “assuming our gender” or accidentally using the wrong pronouns. I have trans friends who were homeless at 16 because their parents kicked them out. I personally have family members who don’t talk to me anymore, or who tell me that I’m mentally ill and should be institutionalized.  I let a shocking number of things roll off my back in day-to-day life. If I wanted to get offended every time somebody misgendered me in a coffee shop or made a comment out of ignorance, I’d never have time to get anything else done. But I think you underestimate the amount of actual malice that we have to encounter on a regular basis.  An exhausting amount of legitimately offensive shit happens, so when you imply that a good trans person is one who doesn’t complain or get offended by anything, it makes people suspicious of you, because it seems like we have two options: shut up and never complain about problems we encounter, or immediately be dismissed as one of the crazy, oversensitive ones when we do. It’s like you’re testing us to see whether or not you’ll take us seriously, and the only way to pass the test is to be so chill about everything that it crushes us, because we have no language to talk about actual bad things that happen to us.  It’s like the boy who cried wolf, except that we’re not the ones crying wolf, it’s being done in straw-man internet arguments on our behalf. It just feels fundamentally unfair.  And like I said, I get it. I’m not writing this to criticize you. I’ve been bitched out over nothing as well, and nothing about what you said was wrong, but in context, it can come off as insensitive when you imply that it’s a virtue not to complain about things. Because you framed the problem as people being “oversensitive”, but some people think that we deserve to be killed and ostracized and that any complaint about it is us being unreasonable and oversensitive. So when you say it out of context, we have no idea what you mean or what your threshold for “crazy” is, so we have no idea if your comment is a dogwhistle or not.
Thankyou, this is the whole point, people think i'm a sex obsessed weirdo for transitioning but the point is i don't just want to be a woman in bed, i also want to be able to be a woman in public without it causing me potential harm.
This production quality is out of control. Eventually we're going to hit a singularity and YouTube will just explode.
I keep picturing @mirandasings singing that song at beginning
Your voice is on point.
My father often tells me a story from when he was in university. He was humming a tune, and his friend said "Ah, you're humming die Forelle by Mozart." Dad answered: "I wasn't humming die Forelle, Mozart didn't write die Forelle, I wasn't humming anything by Mozart and I wasn't humming anything by the guy who wrote die Forelle either."  This video reminded me of that story. You left no stone unturned, and you found a fatal error under every stone. Well done, Natalie. This was an excellent video.
I like how Abigail Cockbane is a funny gal...she needs to take a break and drink a calming tea 😂
ALMOST AN HOUR? GOD YES.
Had to put my clipboard away when 50 Shades popped up there. >:^[
I fucking love Contrapoints. Thank you for putting yourself out there like this.
we are not worthy
i like you very much
I always wish I had more meaningful comments to leave but Natalie, you rock. I learn so much from you. Thank you <3
female soul? nah, just well human bod makes errors during reproduction- those "errors" arent really errors but variables that happen everywhere.
lol you fucked yourself up on HRT, you are a total moron.
This is your best video yet. That was SUCH a great watch.  The court verdict had me in stitches.
Youtube doesn’t deserve this amount of quality content
i love your videos, can’t wait for the next one
Psh, I'm into it.
I am /pol/ years old and what is this ?
You have given us a truly fine gift on this day. Keep going ❤️
how do you get your hair so nice :(  thanks for being an influential, powerful voice in this discussion :)
As usual the musical endings make me sooo happy!!! This was AMAZING!! Thank you for your vulnerability, for your talent, creativity, effort, and time!! 🙌
When's Contra going to make that video Bailey wrote about?
Googled fucksaw and The Fucksaw Incident. 😱OMG! My vanilla eyes!  Sorry if this sounds kink-shaming, but it sounds like this Bailey guy is the one with the peculiar fetishes.🙄
Thank you so much for putting in the labour and emotional work to make this exist.
Natalie is hot. There I said it.
I just research the "fucksaw" incident. HOLY FUCK DO NOT FUCK WITH RECIPRICATING SAWS, THEY WILL FUCKING KILL YOU, JESUS CHRIST.
GRIL
Just a quick reminder for you guys to google the fucksaw incident in case you haven't
I'm a cishet man and this was the greatest video I've ever seen. You're amazing and should be proud of yourself.
I'm happy that the humor is becoming more diagetic with the commentary again.  In a your last few videos it felt like the two parts were happening in different boxes, and I feel like The Trial of Natalie was a welcome return to form.
This made my week, Thank you a bunch!
Your content is like MLP to me, I hate myself a little bit for enjoying it XD Difference being that I happily enjoy the presentation of your content, it's dark and kind of creepy.
Thanks for this video. I learnt a lot
I love you as a woman Natalie <3 (no seriously, I'm a very cute trans NB, if you're interested respond to this comment)
I'm only one minute into this video but I just noticed it's a 50 minutes long videos and it's GREAT and also wow you really make a huge effort to talk about something as awful so wow and also I LOVE YOUR WORK THANK YOU ( sorry for the caps I'm hyped by your content because it's such good quality and so challenging and interesting and important and necessary and editing and everything is just so amazing ahhhh )
ok so blanchard has never stepped outside of his room I take=? because higher success? I think I just soiled myself from laughing so hard I started to cry,..  oh bayley, if you need more perverts ask me..or go on kink-com, they know some too. some even trans.. like, some people swing that way, mate  oh btw.. so if that are autogyne gays..  like whats with all the submissive hetero dudes who get a raging spiffy when getting dommed and playing with "forced feminization"what are those? because yes, those truly get off of think themselves as a woman..until the play session ends that is.
fuckin solid, love u!!!!!
I find men extremely sexually attractive in a physical sense. I’m not enjoying the trans take on what CIS women find attractive. That’s kind of reinforcing the negative idea that women are complex and sensitive and men are just animals.  Other than that, thank you for your videos. I love your work 🖤
Natalie! you are so incredibly talented. The way your analysis and personal experiences/opinions complemented each other and were woven through the video made it easy to understand on a logical and emotional level. I know they are a lot more work but I love the long form videos. And, as always, your aesthetics are AMAZING
This episode had everything: debauchery, fucksaws, therapy, Judge Judy, 50 Shades, Evanescence, Rocky Horror, gratuitous invitations to fuck the content creator, terfs, WIGS! We don’t deserve!
is weird that this vedeo almost make me cry?
I think this might be one of my favorite Contrapoints videos ever. Your ability to blend serious political commentary and clever humor is absoulelty refreshing and interesting since it's all from the point of a trans woman. I had no idea of this ridiculous theory and the fact that you addressed it in a way that was so raw, honest and open minded truly is amazing. I love you and your videos 💜
Contra has such high production value <3
ah great now I'm thinking about my gender again oh jeez
my dysphoria feels like the only pair of shoes I have and are allowed to wear are a bit too small and uncomfortable, so every step I do they chafe a little and they get caught in little holes in the street and make me stumble.. so it wont kill me, but after years, even decades, there are festering open raw wounds where the chafing happens and the stumbling lead to a broken ankle or two and steps hurt and still nobody gets it.  # some days are better, maybe it rained a lot so the shoes got wet and  gave in a little, on other days  they got harder and ripped off  thin layer of new scarred skin..
oh lordt here we go
Is it weird that I find Abigail kinda hot? x_x
Personally I think Bailey was making shit up in his book especially the stuff about what 'cher' did to a donna summer song, other than that thank you for enlightening me for something  I had never heard of before I read about the preview on Twitter
50 straight minutes of Contra? Um yes please
I thought of ten hundred different comments for discussion, but in the end  I just wanted to say thanks for doing such a personal video about your experiences, especially considering that you are exposing yourself both to the poltards and the weird leftist extremist sides that look down on your rational centrism. It sure help to remind that we are all human here and ideologies should be serving us, not driving us into anger.
If we lived in renaissance times you would be my muse
"Female souls accidentally born into male bodies"  Wait, is this what you believe? Tho I guess I should watch more than a minute before commenting
I really respect the courage you displayed for doing a video about something so personnal about your own life. Keep up the incredible work!
mama brought us a gift today!
Great title Natalie, very provocative, very controversial, very politically incorrect, I have been triggered, well done
I had to straight-up pause the video for a few minutes because I laughed so hard at that “this one’s on the house, Kiwifarms” bit. Also, fantastically well-constructed argument as usual.
Every video I see a piece of your heart, and it's beautiful.
Eloquent as ever. You look radiant Natalie!
Great video! It's always nice to get a notification from this channel. :3  (Also, I totally wear a bra to sleep. Mostly because I'm lazy these days, but as a teen it was because I was seriously distressed about the way my boobs sagged, and I couldn't feel comfortable unless something was holding them in place.)
4/10 not enough Skyrim references
Your final bit on the piano was great (plus, you know, the rest of that stellar video!!)
Thank you for your honesty and courage.
This video doesn't seem to dispute Blanchard's theory, it's more a question of emphasis. He didn't claim there was one single motivation among hetero males who transition. I think the key observation of gay & non-gay males who become trans is correct, as a starting point.
Gender psychology pseudoscience deserves to die. There were like half a dozen things I thought I would get to comment about during the video, but I think you pretty much covered all of them at some point. I have nothing to add to this, which is pretty damn impressive. Bravo!
As always with transitioning, YMMV, some have a change in sexuality and some don't. Some have it expanded while some make a total switch. I know, I have had my sexuality changed when on T. I am eager to find out what it will be on E.
I love you so much I could die, Contra! Please let me know whenever you come to Rio, maybe schedule a meet or something, I just... I don't wanna sound creepy but do you know the feeling that someone miles away would be a great friend if you met each other? Idk i'm sorry it does sound creepy whatever. Great video.
I'll have to watch this multiple times to understand. This is all so new to me. I'm glad you exist and make such good content.
thank you so much for this video. My girlfriend has lots of internalised trans-phobia against herself which I think is very tied up with her exposure to this theory. She often doesn't feel valid because of this. I hope you realise how amazing you are!! thank you again, I cant imagine how hard this must have been to make xx
This video was amazing, I absolutely love your work <3
Contrapoints: The Movie
43:01 😂
Is.....that....is that falcon from Gameranx?
I can't speak for women, but as a cis man & someone who's spent any time with bodybuilders, yes, there definitely are men who get turned on just by being men.
Anyone approve of a more egalitarian society I certainly do but not too much.
TL DR: Fuck blaire white
But wait... Isn't a theory that can't be invalidated suspect on its face? I'm thinking here of the fall from grace of the Oedipus Complex particularly, but there are plenty others.
As a lesbian, I thought garter belts and fishnets were super hawt when I was younger. It was actually one of my earliest indications. "I sure do love lingerie and breasts a lot for a totally normal heterosexual female youth." Yes, I also became a big fan of Rocky Horror. Columbia was my favorite. My tastes have matured a bit since then. I don't have much to add that you didn't already deftly explain. I liked the longer format, well worth the wait. I just adore you.
THank you COntra. THis is amazing
I'm a bit bothered by the very biological approach to male and female sexuality, saying that male and female sexuality are very different and that is only because of hormones. Many women have a different experience of sex than you have Nathalie, and it is not so clear cut what men and women are attracted to and why and what is the role of sexual hormones in this. I mean, I masturbated as a child long before having high sexual hormones and still masturbate pretty much the same way.
Like all of your videos, this one was very well done and well reasoned...though this one obviously took an exceptional amount of courage and selflessness. Thank you for making it.
@19:25 Wow, ok. At 23 years old, my own experiences have pretty much mirrored yours 1 to 1 and up until now I'v not been sure how to handle these feelings. I'd like to say I'm not shook rn, but damn if I'm not shaking. I think I'm gonna go sit down for a bit.... But with whole-hearted seriousness, thank you ContaPoints
(I actually did know a cis woman who slept in a bra... everyone thought it was weird but being a cis man I had no idea if that was normal or not so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )
I am rad-leaning in my feminism, although I do not agree with Blanchard's hypothesis. I won't clog your comments section much, but I want to thank you for your analysis and refutation  of his assertions, and thank you especially for sharing your perspective and life as a trans woman.
As for Feminine Essence: What do you think of the bed nucleus of the stria terininalis?
ah yes,, isn't it always nice when people "splain shit to other people despite having no practical experience with it.... like.. even science know that how we view things changes stuff- like thats a reason for the scientific method.. " i think transwomen are just fetish loving dudes" because reasons.. that's not really acceptable.
I got gatekept by a  Blanchard follower when I first started getting therapy. I ended up waiting almost four years before finally getting back to it. I'm finally transitioning now, but fuck Blanchard.
and i thought i was early
Incredible. Great work.
Fuck that guy, but also I am intrigued regarding the fucksaw....
Oof, this hit me deep. In a good way, I think? All I know is that this feels somewhat comforting, so thank you for making this video. Honestly I say "Holy shit, you just helped me realize I'm 'trans'" to too many people way too much, but I guess it's more like a step closer to acceptance each time; You really have been a major part in giving a voice to what I feel, but couldn't explain myself.
this is such a good and beautiful video. <3
fuck i didnt check how long this would be. oh well.
Thanks for doing this.
love you contrapoints your really beautiful
I watched this in 360p because that's just how entertaining, educated, and illuminating ContraPoints is.
Contrapoints is a genuine hero for making this video.
Thank you Natalie for being so open about you experience. I sincerely hope you will continue to feel that it was the right decision. I know that a certain cynicism is part of your in video persona but be careful not to let a part of your self-hate live on for the sake of "comedy" in your videos.  By the way i love the way the song at the end shows a more vulnerable side of your voice, it's beautiful!
I'm a filthy right-leaning libertarian but your videos are engaging and well thought out - always enjoyable! I had watched a video on Blanchard's theory recently and it's interesting to hear your critique of it, even if I disagreed with some of your additional commentary. I can also say anecdotally that female sexuality is very often 'autogynephilic' in nature. Great point about the lack of cis women controls!
I, a cis woman, have slept in my bra.
I'm very thankful you used your own privat thoughts and moments to help other's, i appreciate it. Yes, I'm a Cis-male, already quite informed but definitely schooled some more today, thanks Natalie 👍😆.
Brave stuff Natalie. kinda taking one for the team, in a way. I salute you  O7
Before even watching I wanna give a thought on this.  This is basically some douche saying "You're officially not allowed to like the way you look, or else we'll throw you in the nuthouse.  You are supposed to be ugly and we are going to use psuedo-medical-sounding nonsense jargon with officialness attached to it to threaten-force you to necessarily internalize that."  Nothing but a fortified shame trip attached to an ableist hate cudgel.
I'm AFAB enby and I often sleep in my bra because I pass out in my clothes.  Just thought you might like to know. ;-)  Also you're gorgeous.
This was incredible. Thank you for making this because DAMN you got REAL.
This was really eye opening for me. I've been involved in radical feminist online circles and, watching this, I don't know how I genuinely came to believe that trans women were autogynephilic. This has definitely made me reevaluate my beliefs. I also think that online discourse is not the best way to learn about trans issues; videos like this, with clear arguments that are easily accessible, are definitely the way forward. I've always loved your channel, please continue making videos this long, lol! 💖
I'm not even 5 minutes into the video, but I just got to say, bitch you're fucking glowing today sis.
I used to do Dr Scott.
am in a public place, and just completely  lost my shit in front of multiple strangers because of Abbigale's flashback
"... A woman I was seeing asked if she could dress me up in her clothes and do my makeup." Wait, this happens OUTSIDE of shitty hentai? It would be the easiest "Yes!" of my life.      Why does the all mighty hate me
I find that being super rational and objective is overrated: it's more important to explain why you feel the way you do (in general, about anything) than try and make it seem like the only rational option. IMHO
mega fantastic, you're the best, thanks for serving yourself up to all us faceless internet schmoes
This might have been simultaneously the most educational and entertaining video you've done. I learned some things today about the phenomenology of (a) trans experience, and the skit at the end made me laugh.
You are an amazing human being
This was beautiful, I love you so much
I'm intrigued by your voiced pronunciation of the sh in controversial. I'm not very familiar with American accents and English is my second language, is that a common pronunciation or a personal one?
Fantastic video. As a trans woman myself, I really appreciate such an in-depth exploration of gender identity and such a good refutation of those "ur just really gay lol" types.
Contra, I hope you get a Netflix series some day.
God damn, that's a big vid. You gave me what I need: More Contrapoints. Gonna enjoy this!
Honesty, I don't see anything humiliating or weird about any of the things you've shared about yourself in this video. I mean, I guess they may seem that way to someone who's a bit insecure about their sexuality (and whose sexuality gets a lot of stigma) but I really don't see anything in there that puts you in a bad light or makes you less of a woman.  Also, I'm a cis woman who wears garter belts and corsets and the like. I just like the aesthetic. Real women wear whatever the fuck they want.
The personal experience segment... God, even with your experience of public behavour that I can't quickly describe unoffensively (and so I wouldn't, because it isn't), using what most people tend to consider the most intimate and no-go-in-public thoughts and experiences to make a case against a profoundly dehumanizing theory so that others wouldn't have to do the same... That must have been fucking hard. I don't want to assume anything about how it actually was for you, but I am very sorry that you had to through it. Thank you so much for the video.  Upd.: You actually summed it much better than I did in the end, but I wrote the above before I could proceed with the rest of the video.
Ｔ ｈ ｅ　 ｄ ｅ ｆ ｅ ｎ ｄ ａ ｎ ｔ　 ｄ ｏ ｅ ｓ　 ｎ ｏ ｔ 　ｂ ｌ ｅ ｅ ｄ
Contra I have to ask. How is something being inherent in your biology, or psychology that tells you you're a woman any different from essential womanhood? Also using the t word really isn't cool. Don't try to reclaim it. It's irredeemable.
Thank you so much for making this. It must have been very, very hard, and it takes a shitload of guts to bare yourself like this. It's wonderful. Thank you. And my cat, sing more - you're lovely.
what is shitty is that in some places in the middle east are forced to tranistion if they're gay to "become straight"
I feel so called out by that comment on cis feminists and witches. Also the way you say "Bach" is hella cute.
So "Cluster B" are basically Jame Gumb? Could not his theory be tested by physically measuring the arrosal of these people when asked to see themselves as women.
What is with this insane concept that criticizing an idea is a boon to that idea? Are you so unsure of your arguments against it that you think more of your audience will be drawn into the concept you're criticizing than will be convinced against it?
How much is this just a plee to find a partner. Someone in Balitmore help Contra out and lick up dat milk.
Sorry Contra but I've finally found something that you said that I'm vehemently against. Some cis women DO wear bras! Sometimes our breasts get in the way when trying to sleep and a good sports bra can grant that.  Also, fantastic video! I'm so glad the algorithm suggested you!
Would you now identify as demi-sexual?
Bloody hell, Contra, I wasn't expecting 9.78 Sargons-worth of content!
Almost fifty minutes of Contra... I´m going to need more lube
I am all here for 50 minute in depth videos, keep up with the great content girl!
Is that a crop prop?
Loved the Electro Montegues and Capulets at the beginning
Natalie, why did you make Abigail so cute? Confused feelings about her. We can convert her, salvage that pink haired conservative feminist Quakeress.
"I was born a FUCKING BABY, just like everyone else." lmao
I wouldn't be surprised if Blair white believe this outdated theory and make a video on it
You know i actually argued with my mother about the rocky horror remake they  did recently because she thought Laverne cox wasn't dressed ambiguously enough, and I'm still having trouble with that statement.
Shit I enjoy my own body odor
This is really heartfelt. Thanks for sharing.
Thanks for this honestly - it was great! Also did that dude write that book just so he could try to fuck trans women and cash in on it... clever scheme
this is gold
10 minutes in, no lizards, no fenris milk, not even a shadow of the dark mother, cold mother.... what is this? Respectable academic discourse!?
The other day I had the unique experience of stumbling across the relatively small but active TERF “gender critical” feminist YouTube sphere. The surreal thing is they take on the image of the true radical feminists but mirror all the transphobic talking points of the YouTube anti-SJW sphere and in many cases are even more hateful. They mirrored the Blair White/Contrapoints debate and gave praise to Blair for “speaking the truth about biological gender” while creating multiple videos calling Natalie a “tranny pervert with a fetish”, continually using he pronouns. Maybe I just have a reflexive need to defend Natalie but the fact that this kind of ignorant hatred exists within feminism pisses me off and I think it detracts from whatever valid points they may have about reproductive rights and other issues relevant to people with working uteruses being overshadowed by the gender discussion.
Jesus Christ, Natalie..... Amazing video. Way to hit home.
How is this only available in 360p?
I think Nat's description of female sexuality is spot on. Of course it's generalized, and of course there is a physical aspect to women's lust. But I don't think I've ever heard the difference in male vs female sexuality described so well.  My favorite quote: "It's not a story about wanting a man, it's a story about being wanted BY a man." God bless u nat.
the lighting in this video <3. color theory on point
Making a 50 minute video to bury 50 Shades fangirling, though.
Wow a whole movie. I'm settling in for the night.
That highlight!!!!
as a straight cis woman i can say this is my favorite video you’ve made yet. listening to radfems talk about transwomen, they make a lot of emotional arguments that can be very persuasive. like, “is it that easy to be a woman? just wearing short skirts?” but i knew it didn’t feel right. being a woman is sexy & all — but that doesn’t mean it’s sexualized by everyone. btw straight cis women love & wear drag too & i could so relate to the rocky horror bit - sometimes it’s just FUN to be freakish & hyper-sexual, that doesn’t make you some misogynistic monster
GURL you better know I'm hella cis and I ALWAYS sleep in a bra. I hate not wearing a bra. In fact, I find that really uncomfortable.
I dont know if you read the comments, but could you please make the background music less loud, it makes it difficult to understand you. I know you want to showcase it, and its good, but it gets a little in the way. Love your vids 💎
I respect you a lot for going into detail about stuff about yourself that most trans people would never share on such a public platform. It helps some of us feel better about ourselves. Thank you.
Please put me in my place if my comment is inappropriate, but THAT HIGHLIGHT!!!! 😍
Shaun a contra on the same day omg I'm so happy
It's possible autophilia is a sexual orientation: look at the Golden One.
Wow, I found this video fascinating and intimately honest. And it didn't even feel long I was so wrapped up in it. I think you're brave and amazing for putting this kind of stuff out there. Also, as a cis woman who doesn't have any trans friends I really appreciate getting an insight from you on what it's like to be trans. Obviously your experience is unique like everyone's is, but it's still a great insight that I wouldn't have otherwise. I was not transphobic before,  but I was just vaguely well-meaning, awkward and clueless about it and didn't feel that strongly about it. Now I have a much better understanding I think. And when I see people being transphobic I will now speak up and explain why they're wrong because I think of you. Keep on being awesome! <3
Love the video :) (ps as a cis women I have slept in a bra since puberty :P )
I'm a straight man, me and my girlfriend find you attractive. Not sexually, at least for me, but I'm very attracted to you as a person. You're beautiful and I hope you keep up with this whole YouTube thing.
This video was powerful. I hope you find your happiness
You said psychosexual, that tells me what I need to know.
A 49 MINUTE CONTRA VIDEO WITH THE WORLD PHILIA IN IT GOOD LORD WE HAVE BEEN BLESSED.
This was very authentic which makes it inherently compelling (and in one sense good because authenticity in itself is good), but I found it unsatisfying to have two theories of transgenderism dismissed with nothing to fill the void. I look forward to a future video elucidating your views on the subject.
Yes, give me all the filth Contra  Btw, no trans here, and still gonna watch your 48 minutes of video with delight, so talk about whatever you think needs to be talked about, i'll eat all your filth
Autogynephilia is in the dsm v
That was stunning.
More emotional than "This is Us". #notCrying Thanks ContraPoints. Selfishly I hope your art will be ameliorated by your next love, and not let you fade away as smoothly and happily as a cool glass of Baileys Irish Cream. (Now I'm wondering if your channel is some elaborate native advertising marketing ploy by Diagio. #drinkResponsibly... what-ever-that-is.)
In regards to the sleeping with the bra thing in 44:40, my cis woman partner does it, partially out of laziness, partially because her mother told her that it was a good idea. Personally I just take the damn thing off as soon as possible when I get home from work.

24:19 Lighting like whoa 😍😍😍
So I loved the video, but I can’t help by being put off by how essentialist it is when it comes to discussing male vs female sexuality. I know this might be necessity for the video but... I don’t know, I have never been a fan of hearing how only men are “visual” but women actually hate the male body or are only turned on by “being wanted”. While that may be true for some women, I think it erases the sexuality of many other, not to mention ignore how socialization and not just biology play into it. Not to mention that the sexuality of trans women is not always “transformed” as yours was when you transitioned. I don’t buy that paraphilias are incompatible with female sexuality, and speaking from anecdotal evidence I have met many, many extremely kinky women. I just feel that in making your case of explaining why YOU are not driven by male paraphilia/sexuality you may have overreached and tried to define what female sexuality IS, which frankly is bound to be a fool’s errand, since every woman is different and there is no single female experience/sexuality, etc.
This was very impactful... thank you for sharing.
You look particularly stunning in this video--You rock those heart sunglasses!
did you steal my lifestory for the Patient #655321 bit? scarily accurate
I've recently become involved in a magazine looking to give a space for creative writing and art by trans people. ContraPoints is a space that is doing just that, Natalie is open about her gender experiences and creatively exploring interesting ideas. If you're trans and want a space to creatively express yourself (it doesn't have to be about specifically being trans, but it can be), submissions for our first issue are open for fiction, poetry, creative non-fiction, art & photography. acrossandthrough.co.uk
I'd like to think at least _some_ anti-SJWs might watch this and come to the realisation "You know what? I think there's a small chance transgender women might actually be real".  But then I realise that it's nearly 10 Sargon's long. They'll never finish the fucking thing and will just leave anti-trans comments without even letting it play.
Another interesting fact: A study showed that by Blanchard's own standards, a large percentage of cis women are also autogynephiles. Source is "Autogynephilia in women" (Moser, 2010) The evidence clearly shows that as women, whether trans or cis, we really ought to go fuck ourselves.
A new video essay featuring a sex robot & it's not Lindsay's????????
thank you for this great video :)
Remember when Stalin government used to use the same pseduoscience name calling of undesirables to ship them all off the death camps ,  same with Himmler against the minorities  , thats all what Blanchard is doing , even if there was a real thing as autogynephillia he has really tainted and perverted with hatred  any future study of it
Great job as usual, I always loved the subtle hint of exasperation in your vocal tone as you constantly have to argue your validity as a human being. Keep up the good work and I wish you the best for your bright future as you continue to change minds and help rationality become more mainstream.
I have come to the objective, scientific conclusion that you are brilliant.
Maybe I'm just not able to get off as easily because of dysphoria, so when it's not as severe it seems like I'm attracted to being feminine because I'm actually able to feel sexual attraction without being disgusted by myself
Digging this music hard
Love your style and humor Natalie, keep up the amazing videos!
31:18 "I want other people to think I'm sexy and want to fuck me...it makes me feel like I have value, and it fills up the void inside."  This is how those damn lizard capitalists get you!
48 minutes and 54 seconds!! YAAASSSSSSS GURLLLL YAAAAAAAAAAASSS
16:26 I'm here for that future video! I don't understand gender or what it means to say you're a man or a woman, so any light you can shed on that, much more transgenderism ... I'll be there paying attention.
I don't think I agree with a single thing on your channel, I still sat through the video because I was intrested in what you had to say, I appreciate that the presentation wasn't too vitriolic making the video rather easy to watch, but what annoys me is that there are no studies or citations to back anything you say in the video description, basing the whole thing on personal opinion.
And who can blame them ! *slrrrrrrrp*
Beautiful
"I don't want to be whistled at by a man who would want to whistle at me"  Lol I love it
I looked up the fucksaw incident and now I'm disappointed you didn't find a way to integrate a fucksaw into the video somehow.
Omg I love the Moonlight pink and blue lighting so much.
I've been on hormones for 16 months now and have to say i dont feel any different.  perhaps the changes have been subtle enough for me not to notice, but i've tried to maintain a mindful presence over any change, but ultimately have seen very little psychological change.  All that's changed really is an A cup as turned into an AA cup and my testicles have shrank enough to tuck in quite comfortably!
Baileys <3
Watching this video, and I’m not done yet, but trust me my mom has worn bras to sleep for literal decades. She says it keeps her boobs firm
I actually enjoy longer videos, but I typically listen at videos 2X speed because I'm a sonic fan who gotta go fast. Why can't I do that here?
Kinda random comment but I used to be friends with this cis girl who sleeps in a bra. I thought it was weird because I find bras pretty uncomfortable but like you are not alone or less womanly than cis girls who don't like bras and there's even cis girls out there who like bras or whatever.
I think this was my favorite video, I loved it
Well it seems like I'm an autoandrophilic cissexual female. Don't really know what to do with this information
Frederick II of Prussia wrote his Anti-Machiavelli, put it down to paper and publish your Anti-Bailey Natalie.
Hey, I had a room mate that would sleep in her bra, so you're all good there
I love you so much 💗
I love you contra jesus you are talented n pretty gawd
One does not simply see a new ContraPoints video in their feed and wait until later to watch it.
!! New vid yay!!
38:00 SIEGMUND FUCKING FREUD
This is a wonderfully made video and the way you spoke about intensely personal experiences is very brave. I hope people that aren't already understanding will watch this and develop a little more compassion. You're amazing!
*googles The Fucksaw Incident*  ...  OH.
Aaaay girl, almost 49 minutes? Sign me the fuck up!
can hormone therapy change sexual orientation?
I love the music Natalie uses. Some of it reminds me of indie game music.
I have slept in a bra - the idea that they are uncomfortable is as dumb as it is about corsets
Why is it only available in 360p?
I miss your old voice.
I've been waiting for a video on this topic.
Here we go again... like we're back at One-Eyed Jacks
its just a jump to left ...
You are allowed to be a witch too
Be my waifu?
Paused to google "the fuck saw incident". I must say I was not disappointed.
Thank you for this. It's wonderful.
Your content been getting great.Thanks for It :)
Hell yeah 48 minutes, also mad props to zoe blade!
22:00 *cue Hunger Games meme* I VOLUNTEER
I'm a definitely cis female (never questioned, but WOULD like to switch to a male body for a day simply for the experience of knowing what sex feels like the other way around). I'm also bi with attraction ratio of 80f/20m. However, apparently, according to the info you provided, I have a typically masculine sexuality (visual cues & paraphilias). I find this self-discovery fascinating.
THIS WILL BE THE BEST HOUR OF MY LIFE PENETRATE ME WITH FACTS CONTRAAAAAAAA
Bedazzled fucksaw is my band name.
you are just too cool for me 😭
or maybe P L A T I N U M for all I know.
<3
Can you do a video on history of socialism
I wasn't expecting such a long video. This is going to be a deep watch. I had already dismissed autogynephilia (and the original meaning of the term "transsexual") as being derived from ideology. Though I admit, I haven't read a lot of detail on it - it just seemed to fall quite easily into the standard libertarian objectivist behavourialist capitalist individualism perspective, which unfortunately seems to be the dominant world view at the moment. I.E. the priniciples behind autogynephilia seem to apply to everyone. Trans people are just at the thin end of the wedge along with other minorities, that we are all on. It is a lot to do with why many trans people choose the fatal option rather than living authentically - because authenticity would actually being giving a shit. Anyway. It's my birthday - and what better way to celebrate!  XD
"someone please fuck me" - contra ....    hey what up its ya boi
I didn't realize that the argument for those who identify as trans to actually begin transitioning is that souls actually exist and trans people are just misbodied souls. Am I missing something here or do you have to believe in mystical bullshit to identify as trans? I mean we have to assume no mystical garbage to do medicine. That means the rejection of the concept of a soul is a necessary componant of this.   I always thought of transgenderism as having an inherent preference which you cannot change no matter how hard you try which causes a challenge in adjusting to your biological body such that you desire to be of the opposite sex; for your body to be something that it can never be without significant genetic modification and only appear to be (that of the opposite gender) to such an extent that it causes you enough psychological turmoil that you cannot help but take whatever steps possible to appear female bodied.    I didn't realize there was an argument for a soul needed too...  Weird. So now you can only be transgender if you're a mysticist. Huh.    If you can't tell, that's supposed to be a critique of the theory by rebuking his concept of what is considered the other perspective - that of trans people. It's a total strawman of their actual thoughts. If you think you have a soul and your soul is in the wrong body and you want to use that argument to do science, if course your theory is horrible. But that's not what most trans people think, just how some of them talk about how it feels to be trans. That's not the same as a scientific argument.
Filthy+Informative!! Everything I look for in a Psychology class. Great job!!
The sexuality talk is so relatable it's sad. Off topic, but has Contra ever mentioned why did she choose her name to be Natalie?
Bout 8 minutes in and holy fuck the reading is hilarious. Thanks Peter!!!
That voice tho
I imagine another reason why the feminine essence theory shows up a lot is because of our totally not essentially conservative christian country requiring that you have a religiously sound reason for anything.  Edit: Also oh hey your descriptions of arousal sounds vaguely demisexual
A Northwestern University professor is defending a controversial after-school demonstration, which featured a naked woman “being repeatedly sexually stimulated” by a device he called a “fucksaw” in front of students.  The Daily Northwestern reported Tuesday that Prof. John Michael Bailey, who teaches a popular Human Sexuality course at the school, often holds after-class events which include everything from “a question-and-answer session with swingers to a panel of convicted sex offenders.”  Last week, the after-class event featured a naked woman being stimulated by a motorized sex toy called a “fucksaw” on stage, the paper reports. The woman was not a student.  The A.V. Club Chicago explained the toy in question:  The “fucksaw” in question is basically a dildo attached to a reciprocating saw which, when cranked up to full blast, can drive a person to orgasm.  ------------  you were not kidding
oh shit almost an 1 hour long
I AM autogynephilic, but that's why I'm a crossdresser, not trans.
Oh. 48 min of pleasure! Seem's like christmas start early this year
I think the YouTubes are malfunctioning.  It says I can only watch this in 360p...?
360p crew!
so if there is a philia then obviously there is a phobia , so this blachard  is a autogynephobic , and thus should be treated with exposure therapy
transphobic chasers my god its a revelation
Those musical bits you used in this video, it’s like a Saturday morning cartoon soundtrack. Kinda reminds me of the Bulk and Skull theme tbh lol (they’re great, I love them for it)
unrelated, but the fact you love opera and i love opera helps me sleep at night.
lol, holy fuck it's a 50 minute video.  I think I approve.
As a gay man I definitely have autoandrophilia, I love my dick and abs. 💪🏻💋
"theory"
Btw, I looked up the "fucksaw" incident... Boy... That was interesting...
PATIENTLY WAITING FOR THE VIDEO TO BE HD BEFORE WATCHING AND OMG 50 MINUTE CONTRA VIDEO YES
Lots of phycology are based off studies which fail replication. Maybe we need to move on to neuroscience to answer how people think ...
and then there are straight men or fathers and mothers  trying to understand
48 MINUTES WAS WORTH THE WAIT. BLESS
Yeah, I'm a Cluster B transsexual all the way listening to Q Lazzarus' "Goodbye Horses"  Hell to the yeah! Great video!
That 360p tho..
Omg Contra you are really spoiling us  And can you please debunk people like hunter avallone and nobullshit
Effiminate childhood, primarily attracted to women here. I'm not sure I agree with the clustering, but perhaps it's a question of whether the fuzzy like gets fuzzy enough that there is no line at all.  But OMG: Exhausting and humiliating.  THANK YOU so much for saying this!  I wish we felt more free to speak to this and similar points.
Isn't having a sample size of 1 like, a big no-no in science?   Look, I barely scraped through high-school chemistry and even I understand "I found somebody who made a sex robot" is a great VICE article but not good support for a scientific theory.
Yes! Give me filth!
YAS QUEEN
I googled it.   What the fuck...saw
Contrapoints The Movie. YAAAAAASSSS
You're fucking gay
I'm supposed to be studying rn but Contra uploaded!
FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
I was going to sarcastically say “you have such a lovely singing voice”, but then I remembered you actually do have one.
Mom
SO worth the wait!
Also getting only up to 360p! Hope the higher resolution ones are just taking a bit longer for the server to render :)
college, Jojo part 5, family, I sleep.  Contra uploaded a new video. I AWAKEN
love you lotz
A Shaun and Contra video in the same day?? What next? Hbomber?  Not that I'm complaining :D
i was not ready for this on this fine thursday afternoon
'Wow Bailey, great science writing.'
I always sort of wondered why this dumb argument completely ignores gay trans men (aside from the obvious: (trans)misogyny and mostly pretending trans men didn't exist until very recently.)
Hi I'm new to your channel and i thought you were genderqueer? Have you come out as a trans woman? I fully support you either way I just want to know so I don't talk about you incorrectly. ><
"I mean that's really the scientific ideal, isn't it? A theory that can't be falsified."  Sounds good to me! I'm right and I can prove it because everybody who says I'm wrong is wrong. Checkmate, atheists.
Is the highest quality 360p?
I don't know what that word means, but please give me your GoodOpinions™ on it.
All rise for the queen
Jesus, you sure you didn’t want to split this into multiple parts contra?  Edit: Still watched it and it was great as usual ❤️
you should never be made to feel reluctant to make a video on the issues of trans women, ik im stating the obvious but they're feminist issues and good feminists (looking at you Abigail) should care about how society treats all women, this was a hella brave video to make, from one sister to another much love 💛
You look more confident and beautiful with every new video you go girl!
New contrapoints vid.......ive been blessed.
ContraPoints knows how to distract people from learning for the uni exams: By uploading a video.
A Kurzgezat, Shaun, AND Contra video all in one day.  Nice
WUS POPPIN B
heart shaped glasses?
2:23 Contra, I love you.
Before we even start, this video has your best thumbnail no contest.
Thank you for existing, Contra. If you weren't part of our lives, we would be less educated, less moral and less happy.  Also, you're entertaining and glamorous and a role model.
Contra has the most beautiful voice ever, can you record  some audibooks `?
already watched the whole thing
You’re the only Youtuber I’d watch for 48 minutes straight
Jackie, your new videos get me out of bed in the morning.
you. did. not. just give me a 48 min contra video when I should be studying for exams.
I expected part two of Why Capitalism is Bad, but this will do
New Contra!
Every video gets weirder and weirder. Excellent.
my love! it is you!
oh my god what a blessing! i can't wait to dig into this fuckin SNACK
50 minutes? :O
Ayyy notif squad
I already watched this cause patreon, and it’s really good Contra. I’m not trans but all of your videos have put so much about depression and living into my head that has made my life better, and this was like that too. Thank you.
GOD I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WHEN YOU SAID IT WAS LONG
oh my god I'm so excited to watch this and 48 min? this is heaven
<3

Yes Contra! Totally haven't been waiting for that notification to pop up all evening and give me an excuse to stop marking.
"48 minutes?!?!?!" I hear you all gasp
