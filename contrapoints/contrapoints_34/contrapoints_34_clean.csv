"Unfortunately friends pleasure wont last , do you think slowly dying , aging , will be pleasurable ? i dont think it will be, in fact i know not. However honor , integrity , discipline , sacrifice can move humanity to ever greater heights until eventually we become all the adjectives we use for god . Ghost in the Shell and  Terence Mckenna elaborate on this very eloquently , magic is real and it is only a matter of time before we become golden immortal gods. (thanks to moral , hardworking people, not degenerates)  We will create some sort of thing that will for all intensive purposes end time. So instead of trying to dull the pain of existence with all the varieties of pleasure and hedonism , maybe we can vindicate our uncomfortable situation and honor all of the great selfless people who worked so hard to enlighten us and empower us with technology by keeping that alchemical tradition going. In other words i think you'll feel a lot better dying and knowing you help moved humanity towards a better future , in contrast to dying and knowing you cut your penis off , did a lot of coke and fucked a lot of people who just wanted to use you.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"12:11 G-d, as much as I like you ContraPoints and agree with you, but I must defend Nietzsche because he really was a good guy. He didn't value strong people over weak people, in fact, he believed that good people were gentle towards the weak. What Nietzsche did tell us was to listen to ourselves and work for what we want.  You yourself practiced this. You, Natalie, was born a male, but was jealous of women, something you wanted to be. Through a long, personal journey, you realized that you wanted to be a woman, so you became one through surgery. Through taking that surgery, you practiced Nietzschean philosophy.   I agree with the rest of this video, other than 15:19, where you encouraged your audience to care more about the immediate pleasures of drunkenness than the future, but other than that, good video Natalie.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

That all being said, to me freedom is of the utmost importance, hence why both the lefties and the righties don't understand liberals like me. I want you to be able to do whatever you like and I want to be allowed to say whatever I like even if it triggers weak people and yes I should be allowed to stay that SJWs are weak people fundamentally.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Rome collapsed inter alia because of high promiscuity, there were other things like general decrease in hygiene, the rats became the city cleaning services at that time. There are general rule - more promiscuous culture - less children are to be born. Combine it with spreading diseases(rats and plenty of sexual partners) and you get abrupt decrease in population - thus decrease in potential army etc. The so called barbarians kept themselves more 'in order' then, so their number increased, and they came for agregated wealth stored in Rome, destroying it as a side effect. It's very straightforward, and it's mostly about which nation breeds, and which doesn't. Polish people were part of 3 empires for 123 years, not having their own state, but when they almost tripled their number in about 90 years since 1811-1900 A.D., there were no force to prevent them from having their own prosperous state. Having in regard these information -  One can say, you are in the decadence when number of your people is decreasing, promiscuity contributes to it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"AS A BARTENDER, in the french quarter who recently destroyed a bottle of Vieux Carre (Translation: The old square. A nickname for the french quarter) I would like to help my friend CP as she has helped me. So, when imbibing with absinthe in a traditional fashion one is simply making themselves a cocktail ie. chilling, diluting & sweetening. That being the case, one would first pour about 2oz. of the absinthe into their glass. the next step is where you place the sugar over the glass via the slotted spoon. From there the process becomes expensive because what you would now do is slowly drip ice cold water over the sugar cube and the best way to do this is with an absinthe drip, a large expensive glass container with a built in faucet. You fill said container with ice water and place the glass under it's faucet and turn it to a med slow drip. What happens is the water dissolves the sugar, sweetening the drink as well as chilling & diluting. The cold water creates a chemical reaction and the clear green liquid becomes foggy & milky. That change is called the green fairy and you can now turn off the faucet. The whole process should take about a minute. To finish, stir the spirit, taste your work and if you would like it sweeter or more diluted you may add more sugar or water. Here is a link to a absinthe drip, for more questions on how to get sloshed with a lil panache feel free to reach out.     URL","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I know I'm late to the party, but im going to say it anyway.  The 'Gays came from class and gender oppression' statement has a historical basis (even if it's still an incorrect conclusion). Homosexuality was excepted in the pre-Christian Hellenic and Latin world, but it coexisted with slavery and toxic masculinity. Gay relations was only excptable if you were the 'dominant' male in the relationship or if you were doing your own slaves (particularly in Roman society). Women were seen as malformed men and therefore gay relations were seen as more Noble in Greek society. Needless to say, class, sexism and  sexual violence were the ugly realities of ancient Western cultures.  Of course, the assumption that this  is all there is to homosexuality is false.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

My main problem with the whole 'degeneracy' obsession of my fellow far-righters isn't that it's politically incorrect, 'racist' or 'homophobic' - it's that it sucks all joy out of life. There is more to life than just preserving your race, culture, religion, ethnicity, etc. Sure, those things are important too (otherwise I wouldn't be a far-righter), but we aren't supposed to be drones only doing that. There has to be room for joy, mischief, fun, etc. too. This is why traditionalism will never appeal to me. Most self-proclaimed 'traditionalists' are control-freaks who couldn't care less about their own race - they just use it as a fake excuse to control people. Most of them are crypto-incels who embraced 'traditionalism' out of sexual frustration, and conveniently only focus on 'traditional gender roles' (but only when it's convenient for incels, like arranged marriage).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I really enjoy your videos ContraPoints, but your comments about Gibbon are quite off the mark in this instance.  Criticisms of Caligula or Nero as degenerate come from the historical sources of Tacitus, Suetonius, Historia Augusta, etc, and are written by the highly conservative Senatorial classes, and quite clearly reflect the social norms of the time.  This is complicated by the fact that men taking a male lover at this time was not a particularly surprising thing in Roman society, and pederasty with male children was also considered somewhat acceptable.  The criticisms largely are based around assertions that the emperors in question were indulging in degeneracy and behaviour not suitable to their station at the expense of all of the other duties associated with their position, and we only need to look at Antinous to see how acceptable a male lover was considered if the emperor was competent in performing his other duties.  Obviously there's plenty to pick apart about the ethics of Hadrian's rule besides this point, but I hope you see what I mean.   As for Gibbon himself, The Decline... begins with the end of the reign of Marcus Aurelius and the disastrous failures of Commodus, and barely mentions Nero or Caligula at all.  He certainly does consider 'softness' and degeneracy when tracing the causes of the fall of the Roman Empire, but his main thesis revolves around the poor general management of clear problems in favour of egoism by bad emperors, the overwhelming powers of the military force, the fact that the Senate was a blunt instrument, etc.  He's not entirely convincing, it's true, but your comment here is flippant and as wide of the mark as Cammile Paglia's.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"To be fair, the goal of any logical person is to survive, fascism comes with the inherent selfishness that rests within the survivalist nature of all people. This can be said for every movement, especially things like anarchism and libertarianism. I say that being libertarian, I think that within reason anything that is not highly destructive to people other than yourself for anything other than shite emotional reasons, should be allowed, but I also say these ideals are just as selfish, along  with being slightly selfless in a way. People always want more, we wish to survive, but also to more than survive, such is in our nature. The fascists are the same, but at an expense to more people than other movements, same with traditionalism, albeit with much less perceived malicious intent. What I'm saying is, we all want to survive, even them, but to be the only survivor, or to want to be, is in part understandable even if disagreeable. On top of that, anarchism and fascism are both equally idiotic due to the amount of harm they create, the only thing  I've found that makes sense is libertarianism, as there's less cost to others when those others just have more reasonable rights without the detriment of the absence of law. Not going against the argument, but since this is primarily entertainment based commentary, I just wanted to throw something out for perspective's sake despite it being just an obvious clarification lacking a need for explanation. In other words, I got bored after the video maybe a little too quickly. I need a hobby.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a gay latin person, I find no contradiction between the supposedly queerness of the greeks and romans and their masculinity. If anything, it is the opposite. They LOVED manliness, like a LOT. And the greeks and romans were some of the greatest warriors in human history. Hell, even the legends. Hercules was into men AND women, because sexual power was a symbol of manliness for them (it also is for the alt right, but they flip flop between praising Alphas womanizers and claiming to defend morality and traditional family). Rome was all about order and civilization, power. It has much more to do with those people's vision of the world than the savage germanic tribes, who lived in hutts, couldn't properly write, and had no sense of unity, much like those people claim the 'savages' of today are.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"After coming to a broken cliff edge, nearer to it my mind pushes me. A wall with force behind it made entirely of her will, and others, and the world, of those illusions of my enemies both real memories of my trauma, and imagined evils of my mind yet to reach fruition. I am alive, and helpless? Am I helpless? And I feel it. I feel the will, from my very chest, as if my heart could truly grasp onto that will to keep surviving, as if I can truly defeat that fate, with my mind bringing crushing realizations of its futility. It remains continuously amidst that impossible oppressive force.  And with it I forge the weapons to defeat my enemy in any manner that I can. And I use it to strike at her own heart, damning her to eventual oblivion, and I bring her down with my own miseries, as she tells me that she has none, as if terrified of the idea that I could win my freedoms from her. And I will keep doing so, for as long as I am still living, in an effort to keep myself, inside of my own mind. In rebellion indeed, rebellion to others who would try to control who I am.  In rebellion to this horrid, wretched existence in my mind. And in reality, those people exist too, who tell me that my struggle is nothing. As if it will end my pain.

"If you read all the essays in theGenealogy of morals, you would know that Nietzsche thought that both master and slave morality are insufficient, and that in order to be truly free, the individual must make his own meaning and decide his own fate. You seem to be going off false ideas about Nietzsche and his thoughts. Most of these false interpretations originate from Nietzsche's sister (it could be cousin, I forget) who edited some of his works and put her own racist beliefs and published them after Nietzsche died.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"very surprised by your reading of Nietzsche. I think his point is not that 'the wrong' values are celebrated, but that the whole value system (good - bad vs good - evil) is fucked. master morality is not about being beautiful. it is about a value system that is not based on aesthetic, convention, or law, but on a sense of morality. in making a judgement based on 'imposed' values such as the 10 commandments or the law, morality is not an issue anymore: you just behave as you 'should', and are a good person. but this is not the case. morality demand that for each specific situation a new judgement is made based on values you as a person stand for, applied to the current specific situation. the 'master' is someone who thinks about their own moral values and does not base them off of some existing (immoral) system. just because the eating of animals is not forbidden by law does not make it morally right to consume animals; we can apply personal moral values and debate whether it is morally right or wrong to eat animals, and then make a decision based on the outcome of the debate.   TL;DR: I think Nietzsche's point is that we should think about our values and not just mindlessly assume that adhering to the values of the dominant value system makes you a good person. this searching for your own values he called 'master morality'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Degeneracy as I understand it has nothing to do with 'kind' but with productivity and creativity (or lack thereof). It is related to the word 'generate' as in to generate technological innovation or to generate electricity. When I label something as 'degenerate' I mean to say that it contributes nothing to community and society and may in fact damage everyone.    Degeneracy arises from a deep selfishness and hedonistic desire to recklessly consume the fruits of society (and other individuals) without contributing to the cultivation of the system responsible for those fruits or the wellbeing of the individuals that the degenerate behavior might exploit.   Degeneracy is by definition 'anti-growth' and is a destructive force within society, culture, and individuals.   'Degeneracy' is not a dog whistle to decry any one group, as degenerate behavior exists across many demographics. Plenty of, for example, trans people are not degenerate and contribute a lot of benefits on society. In short, trans is not degenerate except perhaps insofar as trans don't normally biologically reproduce, but they can and often are quite productive. Also some trans people can exhibit degeneracy sometimes. It's not an anti-trans thing, it's an anti selfish unproductivity thing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Fascinating essay. I myself am mixed race. You know, the variety that most people have in mind when they think of miscegenation. If you choose to acknowledge it, being mixed race is a precious gift. A gift that, if you are not immersed, and hobbled by racial identity, serves to point out the hypocrisy of both sides of your 'cultural heritage.' Where am I going with all this? I genuinely admire your eloquence, your wit, and your wish for us all to get along. Here comes the main but. Powerful forces, namely the mainstream media, are, in my opinion, deliberately trying to drive a wedge between trans people, gay and lesbian people, and heteros like me. I have never been homophobic or transphobic, but I can see the damage that the flamboyant, 'scene' Pride marching minority do to the sober sided majority who don't want their hard fought rights jeopardised by needless activism and wall to wall media exposure.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i read HARD into the ...as you put it, 'cult of Dionysus' interpretation of Nietzsche. at the time, i was also interested in Daoism, and saw the two as highly compatible, each basically saying that the path to self-actualization is different for everyone, discover and follow your own instead of enforcing it on others, and with a bit of reading between the lines, that a good society is one that makes it possible for everyone to discover and follow their own paths as freely as possible. on some level, this interpretation makes it difficult for me completely give up on Nietzsche in spite of learning how drastically different so many people seem to take his writings, especially in fascist directions. on some level, i *still* don't understand that as anything other than *incredibly* surface-level reading. like how people take the 'God is dead' quote in absence of how it continues (which i basically took to be a message similar to that in the song 'Stigmata Martyr' by Abney Park - society has killed God (in the sense of 'the divine'/spirituality) by using it to justify whatever actions and behaviours we want it to rather than the stated purpose of having our own actions and behaviours guided by it; this, in turn, is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to my thoughts on this, but this is already stupidly long for a YouTube comment so...). the other thing that i took from it was existentialism in the sense of 'optimistic nihilism': there is no real meaning to anything, which means you get to make your own (part of why the above is only the beginning of my thoughts on that subject). ...to be honest, i still regard Nietzsche as my favourite philosopher, because that was the philosophy i took from him, and - pretty much unchanged - is still the core of my own philosophical worldview. and i just regard the dislike (and, in my eyes, fascist appropriation and misuse) he gets as being an incomplete or inaccurate understanding of his writing. of course, it's easier to feel that way when i was basically the only person i knew who *had* read Nietzsche until... basically now, and that explicitly *was* the reason people i knew disliked him (e.g. 'God is dead' not being the full story of that quote). ...needless to say, getting to actually have some sort of conversation with you (senpai) on the subject is practically my wet dream right now... >.>","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Degenerate: 'an immoral or corrupt person.' Degenerate: 'having lost the physical, mental, or moral qualities considered normal and desirable; showing evidence of decline.' Degenerates are the exact opposite of traditionalism which the Americas and Canada were built on. When something isn't fit into 'Old America' it listed as Degeneracy, like Gays, Trans, Commies, and immodesty (Thots and sluts). The people who usually tend to be against these things are the Christian Conservative (or the average person). You going into depth is like saying that every 15 year old who says 'Faggot' is also sub-consciously meaning that he hopes every gay person in put into a concentration camp.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Kierkegaard proposed three stages of life: the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious.  One moves from the first, over time, to the latter.  Degeneracy means being caught in the first mode, made a slave to the continuing thirst for the aesthetical pleasures, while renouncing they ascetical.  We move from a love of pleasure into a more complete love of one's fellow man: 'Since love grows within you, so beauty grows. For love is the beauty of the soul.'  'Every man who knocks on the door of a brothel is looking for God.'  TGO is as degenerate as anything you do, but he merely worships a different idol. Where you devote your attention to the bohemian, transgressive vision, he devotes his attention to a prideful Nordic narcissism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Interestingly, there are actually contexts in which using the word 'degenerate' is acceptable and has nothing to do with fascism. That is in mathematics there are what we call degenerate solutions to equations, i.e. such as (x-1)^3=0 has a doubly degenerate solution at x=1, or in physics you can have degenerate quantum states which share the same energy level, and also there's degenerate perturbation theory. And i believe i've heard it in other sciences such as biology, it's really quite a useful word if you separate it from the historical connotations of pseudoscientific racism and fascism.

It's entertainingly written, and it gives a lot of insight into the frame of mind of a lot of Anglophone enlightenment types.  I find it odd that their takeaway from the work was so heavily focused on the degeneracy of emperors, when Gibbon himself basically argued that the tradition of the political military essentially began the slow bleed of decline.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The west has become deeply degenerate and is falling apart from the inside. You would think the degenerates would try to work to save it since their lifestyles depend on it, but you'd be wrong.

In Ecce Homo Nietzsche identify as a decadent. So your analysis of his ideas is a bit too binary.

"Zizek explains this in 'Towards a hermeneutic of tribal desire'  If we are talking seriously about taking back local communities from corporate hegemony, we have be able to confront the fact that many of these communities are going to be based around shared identities and values that are diametrically at odds with the neoliberal, globalist, multicultural (really monocultural) corporate status-quo.  Calling people 'racist' for wanting to form intentional communities based around shared identity and values is simply a cop-out, and indicative of government and corporatist social conditioning.  Left unexamined here is the a priori moral assumption that diversity or multiculturalism is necessarily a social good, and that any social conflict or bad outcomes it creates are the result of moral failings of the people themselves, not as a result of conflicts inherent to the neoliberal corporate multicultural project.  This is typically coupled with the religious incantation that we must overcome feelings of preference or kinship for racial and ethnic in-groups, but why? This is never examined, and I think this is due to social programming.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The most civilised countries in the world now are in Scandinavia, whose relationship to the American empire is limited.   Who is between Baudelaire and Wilde? Matisse? It's not Verlaine although it would make sense that you would put him there. Excuse me if you've already answered but I don't wish to read 2692 comments to find out.

"'The fascist quest is to be the only survivor'  You hit the nail right on the head here, main reason being is because I see this desire to be The Fittest in the Survival of the Fittest mindset fascists seem to be so enthralled with mirrored in escapist post-apocalyptic stories riddled with neo-conservative politics. You can especially see this in The Walking Dead comics where the running theme is that collectivism is portrayed as a weakness while the Individual is praised in all it's Lone Survivor trope-filled glory.   It's also why post-apoc fantasies tend to be a favorite of fascists, because the setting of the apocalypse allows for any sense of morality or ethics to be thrown to the wind in favor of self-preservation of you and your Tribe.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Biological devolution is actually an offshoot of the much older social devolution theory, which is observable in the earliest mythologies known to humanity. Btw, we know degenerates will always exist as long as people are allowed personal freedoms, and rightfully so.

A society of extreme plurals that exist in total opposition to each other can only exist for so long before it boils over, decadence can only exist if we are powerful and determined enough to defend it and if most of society have lived decadent lifestyles do you really think they will be able to defend it from those who abhor it, have grown up in hardship and are determined to destroy it?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Nobody who has been moved by the Frist Symphony would ever put it into that montage. I understand your disgust at the plebian aspects who hound you but this is a transgression of the spirit, not the body - and the argument of the blood-science folks was that the blood contained the spirit. As indeed did Absynthe... the Green Fairy.... Art is spiritual in nature... thus the argument was the degeneracy of the blood-spirits (which look a lot like mameshima) lead to the products of Modern Art. For example Tracy Emmin was described as 'this generation's Da Vinci' after she emptied a bunch of filth and condoms onto a bed and called it 'art'.  I mean, we can't entirely reject the possibility that Dan Brown might write the Emmin Code in the near future - but it seems unlikely. Even the lowliest club-footed hunchback recognizes that Da Vinci and Emmin do not belong on the same page of human history - so what the fuck is going on with these critics? One can only assume they have poisoned their blood-spirits... Your blood-spirits must be fairly irritated to put Beethoven into that Montage - but the fact you know Beethoven's 1st and chose the 4th Mvt speaks entirely of a betrayal of your own love for Beethoven... yet you claim the cultural suicide-instinct is debunked? I would recommend you buy a large quanity of Kelp capsules from Holland & Barret. Kelp heals blood-spirits.  It's entirely optional of course.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Contra I'm a huge huge fan of your channel and I think you're one of the best videomakers in this left wing youtube community, but even though I enjoy your newer content a whole lot, and plenty of people on your side seem to enjoy it as well, I feel that maybe this new direction your videos are taking might have problems when it comes to engaging people from the other end of the spectrum. what i loved about your older videos is how extremely accessible and personable they were. the down-to-earth nature of them and the way they got right to the point probably made right-wingers more willing to pay attention to the content. even though i, and other leftists, love watching your new videos, i can't help but feel like maybe these videos are too strange and indirect and uninviting to engage right-wingers, and i think that should really be the goal if we don't wanna just keep preaching to the choir. obscuring your arguments in artsy experimental film stuff probably just makes right wingers less likely to make it to the actual arguments and get anything out of the videos, or even be engaged enough to watch past a few minutes. but maybe I'm overthinking it a tad, I mean your videos on free speech and 'The Left' were pretty stellar. I just think that you should generally aim for more accessibility for the sake of the other side understanding you, rather than obscuring everything to the point where your only fans are leftists who already agree with you. i'd love to know your thoughts.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"In the 21st century two kinds of western identity have arisen. The first has embraced western culture's increased tolerance of homosexuality, feminism, and degeneracy etc... as part of the European tradition of liberty and individualism. They believe this liberty is under threat from the invading Muslims who will take away our liberty. People who believe this are Bill Maher, Sam Harris, Dawkins, and Douglas Murray. The second kind of western identity harks bark to a supposed golden age before all this degeneracy and tolerance took hold. They see the rise of liberalism, feminism, individualism and even liberal secular democracy it self as weakness. They think the weakness is what is leaving the west vulnerable to the ostensibly more alpha blacks and Muslims. People who believe this are The Golden One, Richard Spencer, David Duke etc...  It is interesting to see the conflict and conflation of the two. However, I think leftists have to understand the two are very different and require a different strategy to defeat.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a student of all things Rome, the traditionally feminine and degenerate traits that I assume these 1800s writers are discussing are present in the later weak willed puppet emperors. Nero was somewhat traditionally feminine and Elagabalus was possibly driven insane with power-coated gender-dysphoria, however batshit crazy emperors like Commodus and Caligula were sex craved, fighting, rich bitch, killers. Commodus was a manly af man. You should also consider that many Rome was so patriarchal it makes today's men look like slaves in comparison, if you wanted to make an emperor look bad you said they were sex crazed or feminine, I was just what they did because that what the antithesis of the classical roman morals.  The reasons for the fall of rome are beyond numerous wealth divide, all the economy, climate fluctuations, political landscape, military changes, (fuck it you can hate me) Adrianople, le Huns to an extent, and many more. What annoyed me a little is how you disregard the idea that the actions of the political leaders of 1st and 2nd century could have any baring on the 3rd, 4th and 5th. It would be like saying the actions of the founding fathers have in no way effected the america today. I mostly agree with your conclusion but your reasoning is weirdly off for you. You can see how the lack of attention on dividing barbarian groups in the 3rd century led to larger more organise groups of barbarians to deal with in the 5th.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"TL;DR Degeneracy is literally anything that any right-winger personally dislikes.  Also, ancient Greece and feudal Japan were possibly the gayest societies of all time. Both lasted for centuries. If anything, the Chinese believe that libertarians destroy societies and weak government combined with libertarian ideas is associated with societal weakness and dynastic or revolutionary changes. South Americans believe that authoritarianism destroys societies since South American dictatorships and illiberal democracies on the continent tend to either fall apart or get conquered.  What usually causes societies to fall IMO is a lack of legitimacy. Nationalism and tribalism literally ruin more societies than anything other than being invaded. Nationalism literally caused the destruction of both Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union and even today, the United States and European Union are being ripped apart by competing nationalisms.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Also keep in mind that a degenerating civilization has been part of western ideas since the ancient greeks.

"'Thus, a good man, though a slave, is free; but a wicked man, though a king, is a slave. For he serves, not one man alone, but, what is worse, as many masters as he has vices.' - St. Augustine, City of God, writing at the time of the collapse of the Roman Empire. St. Augustine both revolutionized and brought to a close antiquity's idea of freedom. A man was not a slave by nature or by law, as Aristotle claimed. His freedom was a function of his moral state. A man had as many masters as he had vices. This insight would provide the basis for the most sophisticated form of social control known to man.  Sexual liberation has, from its inception, been a form of control. Those who wished to liberate man from the moral order needed to impose social controls as soon as they succeeded because liberated libido led inevitably to anarchy. Aldous Huxley wrote in his preface to the 1946 edition of Brave New World that 'as political and economic freedom diminishes, sexual freedom tends compensatingly to increase.' These days, we are experiencing the converse of that statement. The rhetoric of sexual freedom is used to engineer a system of covert political and social control. Over the course of the two-hundred-year span, the development of technologies of communication, reproduction, and psychic control - including psychotherapy, behaviorism, advertising, sensitivity training, pornography, and plain old blackmail - allowed the Enlightenment and its heirs to turn Augustine's insight on its head and create masters out of men's vices.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"fun fact, in Spanish (and some other latin-based languages), 'genus', 'genre', and 'gender' are all the same word (not surprising seeing as how they come from the same root word), so 'degenerate' is typically also used to mean 'away from traits associated with your...' you guessed it, Gender!

"There's a pretty strong parallel here with Eugen Sandow, one of the first bodybuilders and originators of 'physical culture'. His whole schtick and popularity was bound up in high-empire/late-colonial concerns about lost golden ages and degeneracy/emasculation. He wanted to imitate Grecian statuary (which itself was anatomically impossible and, unknown europeans at the time, very gaudily painted not austere puritan marble), unsurprisingly Eugen did not live with his wife but with an similarly buff Dutch pianist (a fact that usually gets purged from his wikipedia article).  The whole charles Atlas/mr Universe/Golds Gym thing owes everything to him and Victorian ennui, Oh and his parents were Jewish. Oh and he was born in Prussia but left to lecture everyone on masculinity and coincidently just in time to dodge the draft.  Also in terms of dionysian new-man progressives there's always Charles Fourrier and his fairies.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"A good thing to ask White Nationalists is the point where individual queers/jews/etc become 'international jewry' or 'the gay agenda' and watch their reaction. They inevitably dive deep into the intangible large scale forces at work in our culture, which is the best time to point out that forces like systemic racism and sexism work in the same way, and ask why social conservatives treat them as absurd. This is the point where you can start having a human conversation, in my experience, as you've thrown out as much ideological baggage as possible and engage them at a point of similarity. It's a starting point for empathy, which might seem repugnant to some, but unfortunately even nazis are people too. We can't change anyone's beliefs, but we can encourage them to think deeply about them (and our own). As much as it's sexy to think that we're fighting against these people, we aren't. We need to live with and work with them, as the only alternatives require that we give up our humanity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hello, The Golden One follower here. I don't know why The Golden One was brought up in this video so many times other than you're trying to shame him and suppress his work. I follow his teachings because they've basically become lost in this generation. Everyone wants to stand out and be edgy and be unique. Be different. I get it. The ideology of wanting to be normal has almost become lost. As shown in this video, He can't even promote living a normal lifestyle without being attacked. His primary teachings are go to the gym, be healthy, successful, read, respect women, don't attack others, don't sabotage your life, don't sabotage others, etc.. These are values that seem to be slipping away from society. And this video is a part of the problem. He's being sabotaged for it. It's symbolic of what's happening in the world. Suppress the thoughts of those who don't agree with you. The Golden One isn't doing that, you are doing that to him. As are many others. And about the race thing, I've seen him support the likes of Assad and Gaddafi. Support the RIGHTFUL governments of their respective countries. Is saying, 'We don't want millions of people flooding into our countries at once' as bad as bombing the ever living shit out them like liberal leaders have been doing the past 8 years? 'We came. We saw. He died.' Liberals are the ultimate hypocrites. Not saying you're a liberal or anything. But you're at the very least on the same page with them as to where you stand with the suppressing of the views of those who don't agree with you. We're in an era where you're shamed and attacked for just wanting to be normal. I don't see any of The Golden One supporters out rioting in the streets, shaming people for their views, telling people 'hey it's ok to sabotage yourself!' It's the total opposite. And his following is far from just whites. Try reading the comments on his videos or see what his followers look like on other social media. His channel is about improvement, not 'hey let's tear each other apart.' That seems to be more along the lines of what this video is doing. . . On another note, One day civilization is gonna collapse and it's gonna be survival of the self sufficient. Another TOP PRIORITY reason why I feel it's important for me personally to follow The Golden One. We're gonna reach a point here where all these petty scuffles are gonna be meaningless when we're all on our own. So I choose personally to follow a man who's made me aware of that and help prepare for that. Overall you've helped me even further understand why I choose to follow The Golden One. You're doing to him what you're accusing him of doing. . . That part where you read YouTube Comments attacking you, I actually don't agree with that at all that they say that to you. That was indeed rude and uncalled for. But I can ASSURE you those aren't The Golden One followers. That is definitely NOT what he teaches. Sorry but by bringing him into this, you missed the mark. Maybe you can convince people who don't actually know what he's about, but anyone who's followed him and his teachings will quickly be aware by how far you missed the mark on this","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"If I can defend Nietzsche, his original works were repurposed and reprinted by his sister and her husband after he died. They were huge anti-Semitic fascist assholes. Because of that, most of his original works never made it to America; only his altered versions.  His original works would actually piss off a lot of edgelords, and is kind of uplifting.   The slave morality in its original form was just a declaration not to receive your moral systems from people above you without any element of critical thought.   But, yeah, fuck Nietzsche, at least in his popular incarnation.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"(wiki) Among the very ancient people of Sardinia, who were called Sardi or Sardoni, it was customary to kill old people. While killing their old people, the Sardi laughed loudly. This is the origin of notorious sardonic laughter (Eugen Fehrle, 1930). In light of Vladimir Propp findings things begin to look different. Laughter accompanies the passage from death to life; it creates life and accompanies birth. Consequently, laughter accompanying killing transforms death into a new birth, nullifies murder as such, and is an act of piety that transforms death into a new life.  In 2009 scientists at the University of Eastern Piedmont in Italy claimed to have identified hemlock water dropwort (Oenanthe crocata) as the plant responsible for producing the sardonic grin. This plant is the candidate for the 'sardonic herb', which was a neurotoxic plant used for the ritual killing of elderly people in pre-Roman Sardinia. When these people were unable to support themselves, they were intoxicated with this herb and then dropped from a high rock or beaten to death.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I grew up in a very, very socially conservative and religious family and went to Catholic school for 10 years from junior kindergarten all the way to Grade 8 and I never once really fit into it all. I was an INCREDIBLY effeminate child, I was questioning why God would send gay people to hell from the earliest moments of my religious education, and I had fantasies of tying men up from my earliest memory, among many other things. So, yeah, I was a very weird kid, and the kids around me at my Catholic school really let me know it. This, of course, left their scars, but now, as I sit here at 25, I am a proud degenerate! I'm a skinny gay dom who loves to dominate and humiliate guys who are bigger than me, I'm agnostic, I'm somewhat androgynous, I'm a proud intellectual and intersectional feminist, and I've never been more comfortable with my identity. In short, degeneracy is a blast and I think everyone in the world should be a little degenerate because, maybe, degeneracy is actually about finding yourself and learning about who you really were all along.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Fun facts on the ancient Spartans, who had strict policies on racial purity:  Any child born deformed would be abandoned at birth.  Non-Spartans were never allowed to marry Spartans. They kept slaves, but segregated, and procreation with them was forbidden.  Strict class structure meant that slaves could never become citizens.  This suicidal combination meant that after a few hundred years, Spartans were massively interbred, and what we now know as hereditary diseases were rampant. And, of course, babies born malformed due to these diseases were abandoned. In effect, their population was in drastic decline.  There are historical examples where the late Spartan 'army' would show up to fight with the other greeks, but was just a handful of men.  I just wanted everyone to know that the Hellenic Spartans, who advocated some of the strictest racial purity policies, literally bred themselves out of existence.  Have a nice day, Fascists!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"On the history of 'degeneracy'.  Be honest with yourself. Whenever you yourself refer to others as 'deplorables', what exactly is it you are doing here? Whenever you call people that, you are kinda doing the same thing. You're defining people in a way that degenerates their humanity. You  afford them less empathy because you have defined them as 'deplorables' in your mind.   It's the same thing.    The problem with the nazis wasn't that they had a conception of 'degeneracy'. The problem with the nazis is that they felt it was reasonable then to go 'cleanse' society of them.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is a very good analysis of the concept of degeneracy (as used by fascists) and your production values are top notch as always. But I can't help feeling a bit more critical towards this than your other videos. It gives the impression that it's the far right who are concerned about conserving and defending moral standards (heteronormative partiarchy, white supremacy, etc.) against their transgression and that we, as leftists or liberals, should instead embrace these 'degenerate' practices and happily transgress these boundaries. This implies that 'degeneracy' is an inherently rightist concept, which as you point out emerges from their idea of society as an organic body.  But don't liberals and leftists also have their own concept of degeneracy? They wouldn't call it that but for example the whole liberal narrative about our society falling apart under the weight of resurging racist and sexist sentiments, populist leaders and fake news, which manipulate the masses into voting incorrectly, is essentially a story about a society in decay. That's why it's selling so well among worried liberals who demand the calling out and purging the society of all these toxic sexist, racist and nationalist elements. Of course I'm not against that. I'm just saying that it's essentially the same narrative, just in a different form.  And if degeneracy is not inherently a rightist concept, then transgression is not inherently a leftist concept either. Here I take my cue from Angela Nagle (who you should invite to your channel for a conversation stream, btw!) who has written extensively about this. She notes, I think totally correctly, that today it's the youthful far right who are really the transgressive ones, even if only in style (e.g. Milo Yiannopoulos). That's why they love to break social taboos against open sexism, open racism, etc. and rally against leftist moralism and political correctness. It's kind of ironic that all this whining about degeneracy is coming from the darkest corners of the internet, which are otherwise known for their shockingly repulsive content and support for Trump, who isn't exactly a champion of morality and public manners.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's ironic that Paglia is referencing John B. Calhoun's 'Mouse Utopia' experiment as evidence for transgender women's harmful influence on society, considering the experiment showed not just a 'feminization' of the male mice, but also a 'masculinization' of the female mice. You could just as easily conclude that civilizations fall due to short haired, leather jacketed 'dragon ladies' like Paglia herself. Of course the experiment was complete BS to begin with. A bunch of albino mice living in a crowded cage doesn't even come close to the facsimile of a human city it was intended to be. For example you could also argue that civilizations fall due to unlimited food pellets. Surprise, when you torture mice, they don't do well. Also you spoke a lot about procreative straight couples vs. teh gays.

"The concept of degeneracy is actually way older, stemming from ancient Greece, and perhaps best highlighted by Plato's Theory of Forms. Plato saw the forms (genera) as sacred and perfect, with speciation through change as the cause of all later evil in the world. Politically he mapped it as the shift from his philosopher aristocracy ('perfection') to tyranny, then timarchy, then oligarchy, and democracy as an end state in the cycle in which everyone is a tyrant. Personal freedom was seen as the ultimate chaos.  The problem with his theory was that the truth of genera was placed before that of singular species, unlike Aristotle's idea, where demonstrable complex forms exist prior to the deduction of simple ones. Plato assumed singulars must fit genera, rather than genera only ever describing similar singulars, ironically tied to the idea of confirmation through 'white swans' rather than disconfirmation through 'black swans'.  Anyone curious about this would do well to read Karl Popper's 'The Open Society and its Enemies', which looks at how degeneracy theories tie in with fascism and early communism.

Daria would play that best... URL I don't see a need to debunk Christianity, let faith be what it is, what I do debunk is the inane fantasy of the evangelicals fomenting their family values lie. The FRC and ADF, etal, are imposing an insanity upon politics, families, municipalities, states, and now the nation as they've ramped up to invoke their new standard bearer, Der Leader Drumpf! News, to easily manipulated to present stupid and insane as needed equal time with reality, enables a sense of normalizing to those at the FRC and ADF.

"Also also (if you get to sometimes actually use your philosophy post grad, I get to use my medieval studies one!!) the idea that even the western empire 'collapsed' is highly suspect.  The 6th c. date usually trotted around is simply inaccurate.  We have writings from Romans, in mainland italy and the provinces, from far into the 7th and 8th centuries displaying a solid continuing roman identity, despite the lack of precise emperors.  The barbarians were not storming the gates.  They were trading and intermarrying and culture mixing.  The horrors!! Yes, Rome got sacked.  But that, in historical context, was not seen as it is portrayed to have been seen.  It was an act of war, yes, but just as many other acts of war.  It was not the collapse of a culture, it was one bad day among many, often likened in situ to pompeii.  Basically Germans and Goths were sexy and Romans liked sexy people, even if they sometimes also liked killing those same sexy people.  Cultures evolve, they do not suddenly implode.  There are no hard lines in history (or in biology).  Nothing decays, it only changes.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Social anarchism is pretty much the ONLY modern (1800s onwards) political tradition that's been cool with queerness basically from the get-go.  A lot of Emma Goldman's words on homosexuality, women's liberation, birth control, and polyamory seem fairly commonsensical by today's standards, but at the time (late 19th and early 20th century) even the most fire-breathing radical revolutionary thought they were extreme; and yes, 'decadent'.  She and other anarchists who wrote about sexuality, relationships, and queerness (e.g. Voltairine de Cleyre, Adolf Brand, Otto Gross, Paul Goodman, Daniel Guerin) are also good examples of radicals who understood that social transformation must not only change the political-economic structure of society - in social anarchism's case, to a voluntary confederation of directly-democratic communes and worker cooperatives - but also the cultural structure, seeking to transform popular consciousness through the arts, entertainment, education, and everyday relationships.  In their own weird way, the _better_ parts of tumblr (not the puritan 'self-crit or ban!' parts) are sort of carrying on that tradition. It's called 'cultural Marxism' by the fash, but it's got more in common with the joyful anti-hierarchical ethos of Emma Goldman than the stodgy pessimism of Theodor Adorno. It should be called cultural anarchism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Frankly I don't care what a person does as long as they are productive. Living on a planet is like waiting for space to kill you and if people are fucking idiots and don't realise that them not doing things because they are hard to do or slightly unpleasant can lead to the extinction of humanity. Im not saying everyone has to work in the coal mines. Productivity can be very subtle and hard to see. Your contributions to this world could stop the next Einstein from killing himself as a teenager when it seems like you just work an office job and party every weekend. However people who use identity and kink as a way to shirk on their responsibilities in life are not nice people in my book (like people who want to be treated like a baby again despite they being a 45 year old man with children). Things like songs, music and videos like these I would argue are productive as in they allow people to see new views or even just relax after a hard day at work. Basically I take fascist biopolitics to their obvious conclusion. The entire human species is one macro organism and making sure it doesn't die should be a top priority of every person involved. Ignoring things like climate change, space travel and ecological disasters is basically asking for your species to die out. Once humanity dies it out it basically means everyone's existence before that was ultimately meaningless and humanity as a nonadaptive species was rightly purged from existence. Which is why I'd argue the transcendence of human limitations should be a top priority for humanity.

It's doing whatever is necessary to ensure the survival of your nation in a constant state of total war. Thus many fascists simultaneously support both mild capitalism and socialism but hate communism and completely unregulated free markets. It seems clear that you can't be a fascist if you are pro free speech and pro free markets and pro nation since not socializing anything is in direct contradiction to historical fascist tactics.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm extremely anti puritan I'm miss the 90's Hedonism it's why I find Millennials such a boring bunch, when I was a child in the 80's and early 90's aids was a terror. But by 1993 rave culture and medicine caught up and the fear of toilet seats was gone (yes kids used to think you got STDs from toilets) and I had cocks in my but by 1999, fueled on alcohol and e's dancing doing karaoke in bumuda shorts with 1 of very nice series of holiday girlfriends boy friends and once a ladyboy.

"What could have been a humble, brief and coherant comment has been taken over by an insensitve glorified grandious pomposity for the sake of the youtube comments section and because I have a v.painful torn hamstring/slash sciatica and am being a miserable git. Lmfao - the following probably doesn't remotely represent my personality, thoughts or opinions, but somehow here they are. The video is a great because they all have been. And as usual I'll get triggered af.  RIP British Comedian Sean Hughes, aged 51.  Six points I was thinking about before watching this video (in order they popped into my head) i.e. I don't need your fucking videos to provoke my consciousness bitch, though it is nice to share I guess (even if I am like a fly just buzzing around in the comments...   or maybe a fly in your soup...   Or, or, maybe a fly that buzzes into your teleporter, yes, yes, that's right - insect politics! Be afraid, be very afraid!!! BE ONE WITH THE FLESH!!!! - You're afraid to dive into the plasma pool, aren't you? You're afraid to be destroyed and recreated, aren't you? I'll bet you think that you woke me up about the flesh, don't you? But you only know society's straight line about the flesh. You can't penetrate beyond society's sick, gray, fear of the flesh. Drink deep, or taste not, the plasma spring! Y'see what I'm saying? And I'm not just talking about sex and penetration. I'm talking about penetration beyond the veil of the flesh! A deep penetrating dive into the plasma pool!....ahem...  ok, ok, I'm fine.... It happens...): -  1) If there is no difference between the design processes involved in creating Wernher von Braun's Nazi V-2 Rockets/Saturn 5 Rockets, a Barbie Doll, a Porsche and an Incubator for Premature Babies - then can the process ever be considered evil? Don't we all just have a JOB to do? - American Pragmatism vs German Idealism vs Western Enlightenment Materialism vs Scientific Realism vs Constructive Impericism vs Instrumentalism vs Structuralism vs Queer (post-structuralism) vs Information Theory vs my god how many other perspectives are there? (and I don't understand any of this!) woh ho ho ho! objectivity and subjectivity, 'Fake News' and plates of spaghetti hoops in tomato sauce covered in icecream and sprayed with coca cola to chicken slaughtering voodoo rituals with a skinless Frank from Hellraiser dancing the Macarena with flaming kebab sticks in each eye while killing it in a stand up comedy performance on meth and putting down a heckling of one-liners such as 'I'll tear your soul Apart!' from PinHead. 'The Bureaucrat Song' from 'Futurama'. The amnesia effect of cash from Goldma Sachs. 2) An artist, a scientist and an engineering walk into a bar. All three of them go 'OUCH!'. Then the engineer apologizes. That was a joke about epistemological debate. 3) Do you now feel more of an urge to suck a person's whole body completely into your belly from between your legs if they have a good sense of humour rather than cock-twatting them in the face until they are unconscious from your comedic prowess? 4) There are three measures in-which males and females perfom more or less the same on average: - - The cambridge empathy and systemizing quotient tests (in which males were only slightly more systemizing than females, and females were only slightly more empathetic than males... but at the fringes only females had the very highest empathy and only males had the very highest systemizing) - The milgrim experiments in-which males and females showed the same outcome (if with different levels of displayed anxiety - also there were 30 different experiments....    The 'classic milgrim experiement' showed 65% of people shocking someone to death, whereas in some experiments these percentages were as high as 100% or as low as 0%). Though I don't know in detail if there were any differences like in the cambridge tests above. - Both males and females have equal rates of commiting embezzlement and financial fraud....  Again, I don't know if there were any differences like in the cambridge tests. 5) The Hilary Swank trilogy of movies: 'Boys Don't Cry', 'Million Dollar Baby' and 'You're Not You' - are we all just 'products' in as much as a Ferrari or a hand bag?... Even if you fully consider that we are flesh? FLESH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Buzzzzzz.....  Has the word 'Even' now been ruined? 6) Freedom?... Help from state establishment institutions works by getting you hanging by your finger tips over the edge of a cliff to satisfy their conditions before they'll hold out a hand to help you up to freedom from your plight... As you reach forward with one hand towards theirs and loose your grip with the other hand as the cliff edge gives way, they pull their outstretched hand away with a sadistic grin as they watch you fall... ...with the realisation it was them who put you into your plight in the first place. While the crime is excused and disguised under the 'freedom' of democracy and libertarian 'free will'. 7) (Bonus) When the only choice is between a horse cock with blue balls you can't control, or, being raped followed by having a painfully full milk udder. How is being non-binary/genderqueer/queer ever gonna get you away from masticating grass between continually throwing up from your stomach while being surrounded by tonnes of shit and lower life forms with David Lynch symbolism before you are eventually slaughtered by a leather face wearing chainsaw wielding maniac? 8) (bonus bonus) Bill Hicks joke about those who work in marketing should kill themselves. 9) (Fuck it) If am in a Contrapoints IdPol Cult (if?....), then do I have an identity? (identity?....) 10) (Christ) I am just scared I made it to ten points because it means maybe I'll have to list all my points in terms of a 'top ten' and I just don't know if I can handle it?  The theme tune to the above thoughts comprises 'The Forgotten Robot Soldier' theme From 'Castle in the Sky' by Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli (1986), 'F.E.A.R.' by Ian Brown from album 'Music of the Spheres' (2001), 'Fitter Happier' by Radiohead from album 'OK Computer' (1997), and 'Spacer Woman' by Charlie (1983 - KitLand remix 2013).
