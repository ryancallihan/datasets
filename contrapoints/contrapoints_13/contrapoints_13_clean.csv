"* Roosh, if his dumb book series is describing anything that really happened, is a straight-up rapist and he basically describes it as such and how miserable she felt. He's less a 'Casanova' and more a 'Paul Bernardo' without the torture and murder.  * To his credit; Roosh does practice safer-sex. I'll hand him that. * Roosh's head stick on a cockroaches' body is GOLD! * Also; The PUAs described here are not only revolting but their 'technique' is ridiculous and irrational. Instead of using charm and allure to make her really want to shag them, they are miserable manipulative jerks who insult and coerce a woman who's not into them into bed. * And none of them even enjoy the sex and pleasure aspect. Just a bunch of angry unfeeling sociopaths who just want to collect 'notches' in order to 'prove' their 'manliness'. Pathetic. * Pre-Transition Natalie as androgynous prettyboy nobleman (like the Golden Twink) is soops hawt and a 'boy' I'd love to 'BHHHAAANNG!'. * That said; I know Natalie's a woman and always was, deep-down and she's gorgeous either way and I'm happy for her in her transition. * I guess I could pretend that the Nobleman and Golden Twink are separate people from Natalie who exist in an alternate universe. The Golden Twink could be retconned as a fictional character who's a Progressive/Left-Wing spoof/counterpart to The Golden One. I'll call the nobleman Contranova, Natalie's male counterpart from a parallel universe. * The way Natalie goes 'BAAHHHAAANG!' makes me ROFL EVERY....SINGLE....TIME! * I love ya, Natalie!

The funny thing is, since I stopped making a date a test of self-worth and commiting my life to pleasure, women find me much much more attractive.

"Since you bring up 'Don Juan', the 'opera buffa' is an operatic genre where the pick-up artist is the hero! (Boy, is opera misogynous!) HOWEVER, (and I'm surprised you didn't mention it) Don Juan was Mozart's brilliant satire of this genre! The catalog-of-lovers aria is one of the best comic arias for baritones BECAUSE OF ITS CRINGE VALUE! Audiences at the time would have lapped it up because they had been forced to laugh WITH pick-up artists in countless opera buffa. FINALLY, audiences could laugh AT the pick-up artist for the despicable poonhound he was.  But the REAL kicker to this opera is the final act: the opera turns into FULL-ON HORROR spectacle when the ghost of Don Juan's father shows up to dinner, sings a terrifying aria and DRAGS HIS SON TO HELL. Then, the three couples, whose lives DJ ruined, enter as Furies and sing a sumptuous sextet about their vindication.   This opera is problematic but its important to music history primarily for the final act. Mozart made a daring move writing a dark ending to his 'opera buffa' but it was high time a pick-up artist got his just deserts and his victims got justice.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"0:09 For those people who don't know the story of Don Juan Tenorio (the character), which was the inspiration, the thing is that in the first draft of the story (el Burlador de Sevilla, great play by Tirso de Molina) he ends up suffering an awful yet justified fate: after he seduces the girlfriend of a marquis (Ines) and kills her father (Gonzalo) in a duel, his destiny is sealed: he invites a statue of Gonzalo to dinner as a mockery, and the statue appears, and latter the statue kills Don Juan literally sinking him to hell. On another draft, from the XIX century, Don Juan repents and Ines forgives him, yet both die going to heaven.  I'll just let that idea sink in: the inventor of the trope that PUA are inspired upon already though these people are awful and deserve a fate worse than death.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I started watching your videos today and you are such a joy to experience! You are funny, insightful and inspiring! Thank you!  I think about the women that have ventured to have sex with such a person.... they might pretend that they are enjoying it or do not complain about him being a dick.  I sure would feel like like shit and would try to find the frustrations in my life that led me to a situation where I was completely dehuminized. Where I participated in dehumanizing myself.  It is what this kind of guy will always experience from women. I pity them, seriously, if they really believe that only such a vacuous relationship with women is possible. That they cannot feel the joy of connecting deeply with another human being just because they must attain a certain value in society by treating women as purely cubicles for their dicks. Surely with such a miserable view of persons/humans there is no way that they can really have a deep meaningful relationship with someone (maybe sociopaths can).  And so both are completely unfulfilled because surprise! we are social animals that feel a such shoot of joy when we are social. How two kids, whatever their gender, will play and learn about the world together. It is a sad sad existence to not see the beauty in that and not see that we will always be that CHILD. Don't try to drawn it! :D   Looking at the algorithm on how to get a girl in bed just makes me think that we are so focused on living the most efficiently way possible, deconstructing every activity into logical steps that we disregard much easier ways.....how about practicing kindness? I would say that the algorithm for that is much simpler: 1. see a person in need 2. try to put yourself on their shoes 3. help anyway you can.   You will have a whole life of interactions with other people where you can choose to steer it in a more positive direction . The good thing is.. it gets easier and the feeling of being alive and sharing this amazing opportunity with other people can keep growing .......one love!!!!!!!!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Great video, I just want to point out that you're oversymplifying the whole rape and harassment matter. It has been shown time and time again that consent is not always crystal clear, and there seems to be no sort of correlation between the severity of the crime and punishment. You made a woman feel uncomfortable for 10 sec by holding her waist, (or shoulder in the case of Neil degrasse Tyson) and you're pretty much stigmatized for life and may be fired. There has to be some room for error, guys are not taught this and all the weight falls on them to do everything right so that girls don't feel uncomfortable. I don't think it's incredibly ignorant and misogynistic to say that a lot of us could use some guidance. You think I wanted to be a creep when I was 20? I just didn't know any better. Now I'm seeing famous people's careers and reputations being destroyed for similar things I've done and I can't live with myself, cause I know I didn't set to make anybody uncomfortable back then, even if I did a couple of times. And I assume most guys have been creepy at least a few times throughout their lives. We're not monsters. Most of us have to learn through trial and error. If these errors automatically turn us into disgusting monsters, than I predict men will take less and less risks, and both sexes will suffer for it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

You having sex is just a result of her making that decision of 'im going to have sex tonight' earlier in the day. I don't think men understand that 'seduction' often just isn't a thing. The girl looks at you, decides if you're hot enough for the evening, talks to you to see if you're a murderer or not, then decides to go home with you. The seduction part is just 'how to act normal enough to her so she doesn't think i'm a raping pickup artist.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think there's confusion out there regarding the distinction between pick-up and the larger manosphere. They are obviously intertwined and every normal man wants to get better with women so there's overlap but I would argue that 'pure' pick-up is dead in the 2010's. All the top guys are speaking very holistically and their message is that of positivity and putting a fire in your belly in all areas of life, which ARE interconnected; it can be compared to substance abuse treatment, criminal rehabilitation or other social work where the focus is on strengthening all areas of life to lead a happier, more productive existence. Even the primitive game advice in the 90's, 00' or even prior to the 90's was not about doing some underhanded magician trick that would somehow get a woman to fall in love with you (lol) but owning your sexuality and understanding how intergender social interaction works so that both parties can have a nice experience; let's face it; a woman is not going to go to bed with a man unless he has already evoked positive feelings in her; it's about mutual pleasure. If you're socially awkward, even on the autism spectrum, you may try, try and try and never get a positive experience for either party but when you own your sexuality, commit to self-improvement and understanding female psychology you can have a positive experience even if you get shot down because you now have the balls to go up to a woman and demonstrate interest, which makes her feel good on some level even if she cannot exactly reciprocate completely at the time. As for the exploitation of women thing; it's not real. Every guy that commits to game is growing in value and even cool guys with their life together and good social skills (and good heart) get shot down the vast majority of the time; sometimes rudely. Women will continue to play dumb and hoard attention from both beta orbiters and the game aware guys whose value is on the rise and the game aware guys will provide the women with validation and good experiences for nothing in return most of the time without making it awkward for the girls because these guys have internalized the abundance mentality and their ego does not rise and fall according to the response of the girl no matter how vitriolic it is so they don't become stalkers or violent. The game aware guys are making the world a better place for everyone through their positive attitude and go-getter mentality. He may not be the best looking guy but if you have a good looking socially unaware blue pill guy and an average looking positive minded game guy in a club what's going to happen? Well the woman (looking for male attention, sex and possibly a relationship) will eye the blue pill guy but if they get into a conversation (which is unlikely because the blue pill guy pedestalizes women and is ashamed of his gender) the blue pill guy will make a bunch of subtle social mistakes (nothing heinous, it's just that he cannot lead the interaction and make her lose her socially conditioned inhibitions) that will turn the girl off or gets stuck in the comfort building phase or whatever phase he's uncomfortable with and both the girl and the guy go home frustrated that night.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I first came across your videos only a month or so ago, was very pleasantly surprised, subscribed & started watching more. You're hilarious & at the same time you reveal a lot of sociopolitical views (most of which I agree with) which put these views across in such a creative, outrageously funny yet intelligent way that maybe some viewers will change their minds about the commonly accepted beliefs you explode. Hope so!    I've only one complaint about this one video, and that is your references to 'reasonable feminism'. You implied that there are only two types of feminism, & your definition of 'reasonable feminists ' seemed to mean those who seek equal rights such as fair treatment in the workplace, the right not to be raped, etc. I was actively involved in the early radical feminist movement of the late '60s into the earlier '70s, when there were a huge number of different factions within the radical wing of the movement. I've kept up with writings on the subject, also on queer theory & the movement, and there are still many different views & aims which I consider feminist, although the majority of women in the movements came to accept a view called 'pro-woman' by the mid-70s, and this majority ousted those whose views differed. Ironically, those of us who were a small minority back then have come to see our philosophies become part of the queer movement ( I'm thrilled that these views from the late '60s-'70s have resurfaced in a major movement).     In your other videos I had gathered that your views were more along the lines of what has come to be called queer theory. You often satirize sociopolitical views accepted by the dominant mainstream; you expose the mainstream binary sex views as unfounded social myths; you break down the commonly accepted ideas of innate masculinity of male & innate femininity of females. You're constantly changing your appearance, donning silky dresses & stockings while swooning about in an ultra-feminine manner, switching back & forth and revealing the insanity of roles most consider normal & natural...I love how you're constantly transforming & defying the accepted roles!    So why the comments in this video about 'reasonable feminists'? The definitions you gave of 'reasonable' sounded like the goals of NOW back in the '60's. It made it sound, too, as if all other feminist views & goals are off the deep end. I was shocked.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

And to think it's memoirs of girls banged, as if men are going to read other mens memoirs. You absolute fool. You have the mind of a woman not of a man.  And as for 'negging', it's banter/teasing that is only meant to be done by somebody that can pull it off and on a girl that would enjoy that kind of thing, so much of the time no 'negging' is done.   Somebody can get laid with PUA without 'negging' and somebody that can't talk to girls would not be taught to attempt it in practise until they are much less awkward with women.   You are making videos on things you know nothing about, and people that know even less than you are impressed. .","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"A few months ago I really got into this stuff (mostly rsd) and think I kinda put that into perspective. I think these arent that bad. Because most of the rsd guys (at least the ones I watched) are about 70 percent general life advice and their view on life and social situations is a sometimes very useful. Just take it with a grain of salt I guess.  So in conclusion I think make a valid piont about a big portion of the pick up scene but I think there are other examples too and maybe you could have adressed a broader picture, argue why it does not exist or say that you are just focusing and guys like rush v. Still a good video tho :)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I think the big reason Roosh went into very little detail in regards to sex in his book BANG is because by nature alone sex is about pleasure and reproduction not some over the top bedroom Olympic style performance to be scored on after the deed is done or some no pants dance style martial art that needs to be mastered like most people within mainstream society have come to believe due to bad information they receive from so called 'sex experts' and self proclaimed gurus who sell that kind of  bullshit to the public for the sole purpose of making a quick buck.    To be honest the little info that Roosh gave in his book helped me out a lot by getting rid of all these false notions of thinking that I had to learn over 300 sex positions or multiple thrusting techniques to be good in the sack but only made me a complete neurotic mess ruining my sexual experiences in the past by simplifying it which is basically a few minutes of foreplay until she is wet and ready to want my cock inside her, then proceed to pound her pussy with reckless abandon in whatever position I want until my nuts are drained. As ridiculous as Roosh's view on sex sounds to the average person, it made my sexual experiences with the women I been with way better by doing what nature intended sex to be for men and women...animalistic,exciting,and passionate instead of mechanical and complicated.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"In high school I was a complete dork and couldn't talk to women at all. It was so bad and so socially isolating that it drove me into a deep depression. Then, in my freshman year of college, I found pick up and with it I learned how to not only engage with women but also people in general. I don't use my pick up knowledge to sleep with everyone I can because that's scumy! I'm still a huge dork, but now I'm not so nervous talking to a woman that it hurts.  I'm not defending pickup artist who sleep with people without regard for there well being. But I am saying that a lot of the guys who follow the pickup movement follow it so that they can find a way to talk to people and women in a way that is confident non needy and non creepy","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Don Giovani, if I remember well, is not just about fucking as many women as he can. As you said, he doesn't even enjoy the women themselves, and it's not clear if the love is 'consumed' or not. As soon as the woman fall in love of him, he won. He got what he wants. What leads him to that behavior is to challenge god and its morality. It has more to say than the story of a sad man who runs after women to feel like an alpha or some shit. In a way, he can be compared to Carmen, who is a free woman. She doesn't list the men she loved, but she seduces them and is kind of like a predator to men. She is completely out of the social norms of her time, and experience complete free love, but i always thought she was selfish. She goes to say she loves a man, who will lose his wife, lose his job to follow her in her illegal activities, and then she will just drop him for another one. Both Don Giovani and Carmen challenge the moral of their time, one seeking to provoke god by having a lot of women, and the other by enjoying her life and sexual life completely freely, while never belonging to a man. A bit too easy to reduce don Giovani to a creep, isnt it?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Ok I don't know about that Roosh guy but your claim that 'He and other Pickup Artists don't actually care about sex but only do it because of their mindset that sex determines your worth as a human being' is interesting but isn't justified. The only think you gave as justification was that the act of sex itself was explained very less compared to act of getting there. And this isn't nearly enough proof. It may be just be that for desperate people, -people that usually consult Pickup Artists- any sex is good sex so it doesn't have to be very satisfactory.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I used to sleep around a lot until I got married at age 28. I'm 40 now and getting divorced. So I'm back dating and to be honest it's much easier now to get laid than it used to be about 15 years ago. Why do people need to learn anything from pick up artists? It's not that hard to find women to meet online.  Firstly, make sure you're well groomed. If you're expecting a beautiful girl who's well dressed and in good shape, it's only fair that you put in some effort on yourself. If you're not a good looking guy naturally then maybe get in good shape which is more than sufficient. Shave, take a fucking shower, buy some cologne, dress age and size appropriate.. It's not that hard.  It also helps if you aren't a prick to women. Don't use cheesy pick up lines. I've seen guys say shit to women at bars which is downright embarrassing.   Funnily enough, I met a girl at a crowded bar who was approached by a guy who was clearly drunk and slurred out some pick up line. The girl was standing next to me at the bar to get drinks. She realized I heard the entire exchange so she looked at me with a look of bewilderment. I smiled and said don't worry not all of us are assholes. I asked what she was drinking and bought her a drink. I didn't even bother saying anything to her and after saying thanks, she started talking to me. I was with my buddies while she was with a couple of friends. I didn't hook up with her but one of my friends did with her friend. Having sex with someone no matter what isn't my ultimate goal so I'm happy when I meet random people in bars and we end up having a good time which sometimes leads to sex either the same night or on second or third dates.  They say nice guys finish last. It's not really true. Treat women well. There's nothing wrong in trying to have sex if that's your priority but don't treat them like they're an inanimate object without feelings. There's more to life than sticking your dick into ever girl you see.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The trouble with collectivism is that it infects the mind to such a degree, as to completely disable critical thinking.  People make references to 'PUA's', or 'MGTOW', or 'Incels', etc as if they are all the same and have the same goals.  It simply isn't true.  There are *individuals* in this group who often even argue about what the best way is to do things, and have completely different goals.  I have read a LOT of pickup artist material because I didn't do well with women at all as a young man.  My problem was always that I didn't act soon enough.  There are PUA's who want to 'bang' as many chicks as possible, and then there are ones who want to find a life partner.. and then there are ones who just enjoy being social and dating.  Lumping everyone together is a terrible habit that the general public seems to be getting into, as if the individual members of a group were all the same.  They aren't.  All I had ever wanted, and attempted to seek from PUA material was someone to love, and be loved by.  Unfortunately that's not at all what the women wanted.  They just wanted to fuck.. so they left after they realized I was looking for a relationship.. and found someone totally not serious to ram it up in them.  There is a lot of bullshit social programming and lies going on, and it has men fucked up in the head.. and also has good men being punished for the actions of bad men.  Are we not sexually repressed enough?  Like.. how sexually repressed and shamed must we be?  At what limit will women and cheesy leftists stop slut-shaming men while claiming that female sexuality is righteous?  Why can't we just be happy and not manipulate people?

"Ok, if you read a 140 page book called 'bang' then you were looking to learn the art of pickup.   I totally get the pick-up artist. People are on some level simple. I mean they say that we all flinch when a snake strikes. And in general to some degree a person is going to derive self worth, pleasure, and happiness from the fact that they are more sexually active than another. Because procreation is a biological imperative attached to happiness for normal people. Also from the high number of sexual partners of course people get the satisfaction of feeling like they are more mature, intelligent, and experienced than others, even if it is technically only sex they are more experienced in. But I guess since to a large degree life is about sex it doesn't matter if they are intelligent, financially successful, or experienced in life if they are getting the ultimate end goal then they are winning a massive portion of the game that is 'the purpose of life'. Even if they are wearing a condom and not actually reproducing. It is basically like someone that breaks the shit out of Usain Bolts 100 yard dash record but stops just before the finish line and doesn't finish the race.

"If there are men who want a book that gives genuine, practical advice about meeting women, without the PUA aspects of things like BUAHNG, I'd suggest a book called 'New Game+: The Geek's Guide to Love, Sex, & Dating'.  The author writes a column under the pen name Dr. Nerdlove, and he actually had a period of time where he, too, fell into the PUA culture. But he found it unfulfilling and creepy, and took what pieces of good advice it did have to give combined with the things he learned on his own (which honestly makes up the lion's share of his advice anyway) and make a more genuine, emotionally-filling approach. Not to mention one that's more practical and identifiable to most people.  And yes, he does give thought to the woman's sexual pleasure, unlike Roosh here.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"How come you only look at Roosh specifically and not other pickup teachers who have more constructive things to say? I think there's more going on with pickup than you acknowledge, and there's more to be said about whats it's rising popularity means. Personally I think it's an attempt to reassert structure to the world of dating, the way it used to be when there were formalized systems of courting. Obviously pickup is nothing like 'courting', but in both cases there are clear rules and guidelines to the romantic world that can be learned and followed On the other hand, what society has been giving in terms of dating advice to men can basically be summed up as 'just be yourself!'. No real guidance or structure, just a banal platitude. That's where this problem is originating from.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

And your odds of rejection are super low--plus initiating sex is so easy.  Man, with claims like that I should try to sell this","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

That's why they get no pleasure out of it, to them it's more out of obligation than pleasure. It's sad because I'm sure he was more happy playing World of Warcraft, but all the bullying got under his skin and turned him into this. Because so many PUAs seem to be ex-gamers, I wonder if it's because they're conditioned to deal with problems by amassing points or victories, but it's probably just because they get bullied so much by the same media that promotes feminism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"A large percentage of homosexual men are outrageously promiscuous.  'Pickup artists' don't even come close to having had the sheer number of partners that a good 10% of the gay male population has had.  And yet gay promiscuity is not at all under a similar attack here.  So why aren't you criticizing the gay population for similar behavior?  The reason is simple you are a paternalistic tool that cannot imagine that it is remotely possible that women want sex as much as men do and so you don't view the women involved in 'Pickup' culture as participants, you see them as victims.  You are such a hypocrite describing the 'Bang' as being such a bad thing while being fully aware that there are men showing off their wedding rings under bathroom stalls while you are not bothered by the complete romance free nature of that one bit.  The real problem that SJW culture has with Roosh V is that they cannot stand the reality of the actual sexual preferences and behaviors of a huge segment of the female population and it drives them crazy that huge numbers of women do like aggressive, brash men who do not put up with their crap.  The fact that huge numbers of women respond well to behavior that is completely contrary to the SJW narrative that all men should be weak testosterone-free syncophants who treat women as their lords and masters just drives them up the wall.  Too bad the reality and rhetoric don't match up.  The book focuses on what it focuses on to undo the SJW cultural brainwashing that makes men less attractive to women.  I look forward to your video on Gay pickup culture.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I am by no means advocating pick-up artistry myself due to at best practical reasons and at worst that manipulation is a shitty and short term way to engage with women, but a friend of mine who does still believe in pick-up artistry said two things for which I had little reply:  1. That the coin toss analogy falls somewhat flat due to the fact that you cannot modify the coin's behavior in a fair coin toss, while with pick-up artistry you can modify your own behavior each time, and  2. The fact that talking to a woman about what she likes regarding sex or other forms of interactions is somewhat fruitless since there is a significant portion of women, from his experience, that do not know what they want in those categories, so you should try things until you find it rather than simply asking.  Just looking for replies, because sometimes I have trouble articulating my points. I did, at the very least, try to reply to the second point by saying that trying to gauge it is valuable since in the end he did figure out that his girlfriend didn't know. Better to do that rather than assuming.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I don't think you realize that a man's promiscuity or ability to get sex is strongly tied to his social worth. The dynamics for men and women are not equivalent, mainly because our society and biology aren't either. Say what you will, but there is evidence that women are more attracted to a man who gets a lot of ass than not. With men's it's usually the opposite in regards to women.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Came here from Noelplum. I must say some refreshing angles here, presented in a funny way ;-)  What I really don't get is that most men (at least all the ones I know) are not into sleeping with many women, but sleeping with one woman over and over again. And hopefully giving and receiving pleasure in the act. I mean isn't the whole point to pick up or be picked up by just one woman and then stay together and enhance and nourish the sexual fun you have together and also cherish the positive emotions the partner feels? I mean it's not only a good feeling to come yourself, but also to make her (or him or whatever) come. Seeing and giving pleasure is another form of extra pleasure so to say.  So why train pickung up women over and over, wouldn't it make much more sense to make guides on how to keep your relationship alive and happy and long lasting? Also I wouldn't want to manipulate a woman into sleeping with me, even if I am single, she is hot and it works. But then again, I am from Germany and from a background that many would describe as white privilege, so I probably don't count.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Solid video with a lot of good points.  It might be true that .01% of feminists are 'antisex' or whatever, but honestly its my opinion that .01% of men are these walking sex spreadsheets as well. Pick up artists are in the great minority.  Now, it might seem confusing, but I actually have a lot of experience with 'alpha males.' And I got to tell you, they're really just insecure dudes who want other people to think they're tough. How do I know this? Because I was on an NCAA Div II Wrestling team. I hung out with athletes. I actually knew them. And when guys get together they tell stories and embelish. Its what they do. Is it right? maybe not. I don't know.  But I know for a fact that most of the guys who do this are doing it for the show and the societal acceptance. Because its what they think they have to do because they're 'men.' You hit that point quite well.  So now the topic of conversation probably shifts to 'how do we change the culture.' To that I'd say, good luck. Trying to change people who are trying to appear independent, masculine, and 'strong' individuals is never going to work using the tactics that men use, or even you used Nick.  I think you know this, and I think that's why your videos are always serious, but pretty lighthearted. And yea, women do get raped from time to time and objectified or feel threatened, by it but I think that's because most of them really don't understand how alone and sad a lot of these 'alpha' males are. I'm not saying that women are at fault when they're raped, but I think there's a tendency for women to get caught up in that same kind of culture where they have to feel like they are to be 'pursued' in order to feel like they have worth. As a result, they end up putting themselves in quite compromising situations with people they don't know.  What's going to get the culture to change isn't to brow beat people and tell them how unhappy they are. They're just going to laugh at you and mock you. What's going to get people to change is for individuals to go out into the culture and connect with people on a real level. Plato's Cave is such a good allegory because once you've been freed, you don't shout the truth into the cave from afar, but you put yourself in real harms way by going back into the cave, speaking the truth, and then dying a horrible death to the wrath of the mob.  There is no other way to enact change for the truth. All other change will be merely political and subject to whomever controls the power. And if history teaches us anything, its that no power lasts forever.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The fear of being perceived as lacking masculinity is a performance for other men. It's a psychology of normativity that is about male sex acts performed for the gaze of other men. That this may seem a little gay is not lost on critiques. Watch the movie 'Goat' or 'Riot Club' and see if you can't develop the queerness of hypermasulinity a little.

"I was in the pickup community about five years back. I kept stumbling on communities of dudes who had the same problems as me so I gave it a go. I joined the local 'lair' and started practising pickup with pickup artists in my area - you'd be surprised just how many there are in urban areas.  I was the stereotypical awkward dude, 21, had 1 previous girlfriend and a couple of loser friends. I was trying to find a way out of my loneliness - in my experience a lot of the guys who do pickup are the same, either extremely lonely or sociopaths.  But, what really unions these people is that they're almost all overly analytical and as a result socially retarded. They're people who have slowly developed resentment for not being accepted by women or the 'alpha men' growing up. It's no surprise that you see books like Roosh's when that's the demographic. These people don't really care about the act of sex or romance, they're not doing it for connection or love, they're doing it so they can accept themselves and find a way out of the loneliness and the rejection they've experienced all their lives.  You find a lot of guys in the community will get decent at attracting women then give up on pickup. At that point there's really no benefit hanging around with loser guys talking about different routines and methods. These people start wanting more than just to count their results and begin to want more meaningful relationships and friendships. Some don't though, but like I said there are definitely a large amount of sociopaths in the pickup community who simply enjoy manipulating people into the most intimate act. I would guess Roosh is one of those people who enjoys manipulating people. Most of the guys who are decent at game and in the community for a long time are that type.  But there are some really good pickup artists out there who also focus on giving guys advise to improve their relationships. Obviously these are rarely the guys who get attention in the media, but not all pickup artists are bad dude. Most are decent guys, just lonely and often a little bitter. For me personally it change my life in a really positive way and I'm in a great relationship now for it. But even if I would have to say at least 20% of the community is toxic.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"DooblyDoo Dates back to March 2009 and was Coined by the Youtuber WheezyWaiter and eventually popularized by the VlogBrothers. Back then regular youtubeing existed within a singular community where most people watched everyone else and there was a lot of in-stuff and constant meta talk about the platform. the spirit behind coining the term I think came from the fact that youtube had multiple times changed the name of the description as well as it's location and there was a more general meme of 'ah! youtube's layout is alwaysd changing!' so it was kind of meant as a 'youtube will probably call it somnething else tomorrow so I'll just give it a jibberish name instead.' thing.  Also, the Youtube aesthetic as well as the influence of Nerdfighteria Culture celebrated quirkiness and peculiarity, so it quickly became a popular neologism in the community and almost a sort of subtle cultural indentifier. at this point, it's one of the relics of the spirit of the old community vibe still present in today's videos so it does stick out as a 'what did they just say?' thing for people who weren't around then.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Gotta admit this one was pretty hilarious. I think PUAs are an easy target because even a lot of us on the right fucking hate them. Something that's important which I don't think you brought up is how this PUA/slutty lifestyle is really psychologically harmful. Every time you form attachment to someone and then either dump them or get dumped, part of your ability to form those strong bonds is lost forever. You become numb and cynical. At the extreme end of this behavior, people become practically emotionally crippled, unable to form stable, loving, long-term relationships and to function as good parents. I'm not saying it's wrong to be a slut, only that people should know the risks before they go running into it. I think a lot of lonely men fall into this PUA idea that all you want is casual sex with an many women as possible, when in reality what these men need is a wife who loves them.

"CP truly cares about his fans.  He acts out split-personality yaoi fanfiction of himself before we even have the chance to write it.  On a serious note, I've never read any of Roosh's stuff (his reputation precedes him), but I'm surprised to learn he doesn't actually seem to care about the pleasure gained from sex all that much; how playing the role of 'alpha male' and accruing social status seem to take precedence. But now knowing it, so many things make sense.   He's not pursuing sex because he wants to feel as much pleasure as possible in his short life, but to fulfil a kind of life-path patriarchal society has told him will turn men into persons of worth and power.   It's kind of sad to be honest. I'd almost feel bad for the guy if he weren't such a raging douche whose ideology has severely horrid effects on both women and men.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
