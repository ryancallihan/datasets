1,"Well, that way a very effective way of giving people an idea of what living with gender dysphoria is like. Your films are very powerful and beautifully made. Thank you for sharing your own journey on YouTube. I can't imagine it was easy. You seem so much more confident and easy in your own skin.

2,"I have all these reasons rationally that I should be the manliest dude you've ever met. The physical evidence all says so. But instinctively I just want to put on a bra and girl's pants. I don't have a fetish over women's clothing. When I let my feelings be honest, I often get anxiety attacks over my shape. I feel like I'm walking with a mix between my guilt, my logic, my dysphoria, and my desires. That's how I feel my brain is split. Fine. Just ignore these super-helpful comments.

3,"*'Be a man'*  Here's a list of manly things I've done: *Swam two mile-long races, competitively* *Captain of my water polo team for 2 years, during which time we won 3/5 games the first year and 4/5 the second year.* *Won both my school's sit-up challenge (most in 60 seconds) (and the most we can do without stopping)* *I came second in the school's arm-wrestling challenge* *I won the long-distance running challenge at school against other guys who prided themselves on their speed* *I've won a silver medal in Breaststroke in a Championship* *I've won every physical fight I've ever been in. 2/2 both claimed to be the best fighters in the school* *I got ripped at the gym by the age of 16. I never even realised I was ripped until people started nicknaming me, 'Big Man ...* *I've worked through every psychological issue I've had with anything. My only worry now is what people would think and say if they knew I was a girl on the inside.* *I am an active team member in everything I do and I partake in activities regularly*  I've undergone tons of powerful hypnosis to give myself a manly-man mindset. It led to me developing bipolar disorder, and I would bottle up my feelings, and get extremely defensive about when people questioned my masculinity, or rather, I tried to convince myself that I should be extremely offended. I wasn't. When I look at it in terms of myself, I found the *implication* offensive rather than the word, because I had gone through so much to try and prove to myself that (yes, I am more of a 'man' than most men will ever be) but I identify as a girl. Through everything, it was the girl who told the masculine body to keep going, don't give up, keep trying. But the voice inside from the beginning was always a girl's; not my mum's. Mine. My own voice. All this history which increased my testosterone, got me ripped and made me the ( *maybe there's something dodgy about that person, they've raged a few times but are trying to be the best them* 'man' I am today). If I felt like this was all myself, I should be admired, I should be popular, I should be literally the king of my entire school. I have confidence in spades. I help people wherever they deserve it. I have good advice to go around. No one tells me what to do. I am not afraid of anything. I could be so many people; a police officer, a pilot, a detective; a business manager. I am smart enough to figure out how to do every job. And yet I still want to be a girl.  The only thing I am afraid of; who I am, and who I might really be I just never feel okay and like myself. I know who I should be as a man. The picture is so clear in my mind, well thought out and rational. And yet I subconsciously don't want it. And there is nothing standing between me and that, that it doesn't feel like me.",en,relativeinsight,2019-08-01T00:00:00,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
4,"*Hiya! A note to trans women, I can advise you on how to get the higher voice you'd like.* Not all of you like singing, but it will take time, and this is how I did it. You have to practice singing, and lots of it. Practice a range of notes, especially high ones. *Funnily enough, I helped myself get a higher voice. One that especially helped was singing Bohemian Rhapsody. Note: your lungs and throat will HURT, like HELL. But that's all the process of your lungs becoming stronger in different places, and your voice box becoming stronger.*",en,relativeinsight,2019-08-01T00:00:00,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

It also happens that I've been clean shaven recently as I'm looking for jobs and my beard does not fill out like it should. So this 'female version' of me was a little easier to visualise. I will say I did have a passing thought that maybe I'd be more attractive as a woman than a man.

Where every day and night I fight to validate my existence when I know I shouldn't have to. Ironically my appreciation for feminine expression came from the grace and elegance of trans women. I greatly enjoy seeing such creative expression on Contrapoints videos. I have nothing against womanhood, im just not a woman. And I will often conflict with cisgender men I know. I realize they are lost as well in this weirdly gendered game of social norms. We have to stop hiding behind the labels that define us, and define ourselves.

245,"I can kind of relate to trans woman, even though I am cis gay guy. I mean, I don't identify as a woman, but I do identify as effeminate. What do I mean by 'effeminate'? I am effeminate in the traditional sense, I am: non aggressive, I believe interdependence, shy, passive, home oriented, super moody, gentle, sensitive to other's feelings, kind, tactful, nurturing. On top of that, I dance shirtless to electronica, I love fashion, I love home decor, I love theater(I love performing arts in general), I am limp wristed, I am swishy, I talk with a lisp, and I prefer fruity cocktails and red wine over beer. I used to be embarrassed about being femme, but now I wear my queerness as a badge of honor. While I have absolutely zero intention of transitioning into a woman( I want to look like the gods from Greek mythology),I get frustrated, annoyed, saddened, when people tell me that they are fine with me being gay, so long as I don't act like I am gay.  I had to put on an act for people, just so I could blend in, and all it did was ruin my self esteem. So I kind of get where trans women are coming from; dissatisfaction with physical experience, an intense dislike of being told to act like a 'man', choosing whether you want to live authentically and be an outcast, or fit in society and be miserable.  All I can say is use self affirmation, tell your self that you matter, and that so long as you are happy with your self, then it does not matter what society thinks about you. It has been working for me for the past three years, and I feel like I am finally out of that dark pit of despair.",en,relativeinsight,2019-08-01T00:00:00,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

247,"I am not a trans woman, but I identify as an effeminate cis gay man, and I can somewhat relate to this. When people tell me ' grow a pair',' be a man', etc, it makes me feel like a complete nobody. I feel that if I were a masculine, butch, dominant man, people would respect me, validate me, and treat me like a normal human being. Since I am not only gay, but effeminate, I have been usually treated with disdain, and humiliation from family, friends, and classmates. I used to feel worthless, I used to feel like a freak of nature, and no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't be a 'man'. Now days, I use self affirmation to deal with these negative thoughts. I constantly remind myself that I am special, that I have value, that I have purpose, that I am fabulous, and that I am proud. I tell myself that as long as I value myself, it does not matter what anyone else says about me. And to be honest, it is been working for me for the past few years. I feel more confident in my skin, and I feel like I don't have to pretend for people. I have no intention of catering to people if it means that I have to be miserable. So long as I am happy with myself, fuck what other people think.  Good video btw, people need to realize that gender dysphoria is a medical condition, and that being transgender, nb, queer in general, is not some lifestyle choice.",en,relativeinsight,2019-08-01T00:00:00,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

370,"The depiction at the beginning sounds exactly like my thought spirals. I have general anxiety and depression, manifested largely as hypochondria and an irrational fear of instant death.  The thought spirals often start with something innocuous, moving onto something serious, then to something extreme, before logic takes hold. 'my left arm feels kind of sore, is my heart in arrhythmia? Did a blood cut form in my legs and make it to my brain? Can I feel my face? Is the left side of my mouth drooping a little?... your heart rate isn't even that high and your damn mouth isn't drooping you fucking scared piece of shit stop freaking out over literally nothing.'  I haven't had suicidal ideation in some time but that end point would also be where I'd start thinking about how my brain is defective since I'm almost always in some level of fight or flight without medication, how I'm worthless and not worth wasting time and energy on, and that I'd get a double whammy of greatness by relieving the burden on my loved ones while taking control of my death by just choosing when and how to do it myself.  So yeah, this hit pretty close to home even though I'm a total 'meh' on the gender thing, which I think basically makes me a happy cis male.

Like the hairline thing doesn't happen to me because I'm not as old as you (idk how old ya are but idc as much the point was still poignant), meanwhile the alienation to my genitals I can relate to (that bit was both very comedic and metaphorical), meanwhile the Tumblr bit was haunting considering I struggle with the criticism I think you were referencing (rapid gender dysphoria, I think? basically you go online and then see some trans content in some nature, then boom you're Trans but not REALLY???), and yet I get so anxious whenever I shave my body, and I can't help but feel myself. Who else could I be?  So what is this nonsense?! Am'I confused because I'm actually Trans and am being influenced by false information? Or rather is it that I'm a man in reality? If that's the case then am I being harmful to the community by trying to explore myself, or is this really appropriation? Am I just too wrapped up in my head...

591,"Have you read Mercedes Lackey's fantasy books? Magical horse companions, like huge My Little Ponies but more badass. I realize how ridiculous that sentence is. Anyways, there's a culture in there that has sorta sexual healer/therapist types who often have a blending of genders which gives them unique insights for helping people heal from emotional damage. Your video brought them to mind for some reason. I think it's because all this pain seems to be comparing yourself in this either/or habit instead of embracing the mix. I bet that the spiritual person for a lot of tribes throughout history was often intersex or gender-mixed because they'd see things differently. Imagining David Bowie, there's a power to androgyny. Seems silly to try to abandon that to choose a simulation of either side instead of being the wonderful mix that you are. I've had a similar issue from being bisexual and not really identifying with a lot of the masculine ideals in the culture around me. But I've been feeling the Camus influence, not really in depth into absurdism, but the basic idea of accepting the apparent lack of meaning and just going on with life despite it instead of trying to fill the lack of an answer with random garbage. Or at least that's how I'm taking it, not sure if that's right. So I accept that I'm a weird little bi spaz monkey creature and that other people are their own special blend of crazy and we're all rushing about until we die. Since death is inevitable, I figure might as well witness the experience of being myself in the world as it is right now. I might go Steppenwolf and off myself when I'm old and my body feels like crap but maybe by then I'll like a little pain, feel alive at least. No telling at this point, 37 right now. Feels like I'll blink and be 65 and wonder where it all went. That'll be cool, I'd like to see my old face in a mirror, drop acid first then stare at all my wrinkles in a really good fall light, all warm. See all the tracks of experiences of my life written all over my body. There's a part of me that is so fucking afraid of that so there's this weird feeling of release by contemplating it and letting it wash over me, or maybe I just have to pee :)",en,relativeinsight,2019-08-01T00:00:00,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

698,"'Why won't you fuck me?' 'I don't want to.' 'Why not?' 'It makes me feel like a man.'  I want you to know this specific bit of dialogue made me realize a lot of things about myself I hadn't been able to articulate, or even acknowledge.  I'm 24 years old and I've only just realized my hangups with sex were inherently linked to dysphoria. Hell, I didn't even realize I *had* dysphoria, I just thought I was having bad sex. For me, more often than not, it's not even anything to do with genitalia, or even secondary sex characteristics -- speaking as someone who's slept with men and women and people of all genders, you just don't *hold* a man the same way you hold a woman (problematic as that may sound, because I still don't really have the vocabulary to express that more effectively.) My past sexual partners invariably perceived me as something I didn't identify with, and it made me crawl so far out of my skin that I couldn't enjoy any form of intimacy, let alone sex, without dissociating into the fucking stratosphere.  I watched this video on a whim, more to understand what my transfeminine friends go through than anything, but that line -- 'It makes me feel like a man.' -- that literally hit me so hard I had to pause the video and process it for a minute. I always thought I was one of the lucky ones whose dysphoria is quiet, almost kind -- I always told people I didn't really *get* dysphoria, because in most ways... I didn't. I liked the way I looked, because I knew I looked good, even if it was in a way I couldn't identify with. I thought I couldn't really feel like I was in the wrong body if gender itself didn't feel like anything more than a performance to me. But when it comes time to let someone put their hands on me, when I can't hide the telling parts of me, I feel exposed -- like they saw me for who I am when there was still an element of mystery, but the second the clothes hit the floor, the pretense is gone. And I can't bring myself to be angry with them, because they don't even know they're doing it.  Maybe this is too much information. Maybe I'm getting a little too vulnerable here. There's obviously more to it than just the sex, but that's the part that revealed the most emotional baggage for me, and I've still got a ways to go before I'm done unpacking. I still haven't even figured out how to address that problem, but at least it's got a name now. All I can hope is that this show of vulnerability can help someone put words to what they're experiencing as much as this video did for me.  Anyway, I've been meaning to come back and thank you. I can't imagine how difficult this must've been to film, and you've got my undying respect.",en,relativeinsight,2019-08-01T00:00:00,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
699,"I don't know how anyone could watch this and not just fall in love. Seriously. I'm a trans guy, VERY early into my transition, and I feel a lot of this (just like, the opposite). Like the thing about sex- I honestly thought I didn't enjoy sex for a long time, until I met a man who accepted me as a man. Then I realized that the reason I hadn't enjoyed sex with other men was because it made me feel like a girl, and not like myself.  The hair thing. I seriously feel that, except the exact opposite lol. I look at the fine, light hairs that cover my legs and I feel hopeless. I look at my smooth, beardless face and I feel like giving up. I hear my high, pixie-like voice and I hate myself. It hurts so damn bad. The way I see myself in my head and the way I see myself in the mirror are unconnected, and it seriously fucks with me. I'm sorry that you have to deal with this, but I'm glad that you made this video and posted it, because it made me feel less alone. I'm sure other trans people feel the same. I hope the pain lessens.

I get the impression that it's more than that: they also claim to 'feel' that they are of the opposite sex, not just the opposite gender.   What I can't understand is 'feeling' female (or male, for that matter). Sure, having an erection, and having sex as a male 'feels' a certain way, and that experience is not available to females. And I'm sure that having breasts and a vagina allows for certain experiences that are not available to males. So I can definitely understand that males and females have different sexual experiences. But is that all that is meant by 'I feel like I am in a male body' or 'I feel like I am in a female body'? Again, I don't think so.   As the video demonstrates, trans people also claim to feel something like dysmorphia: they feel that they shouldn't have the secondary sex characteristics that are typical of their sex at birth, and that their body should be morphologically similar to the other sex. For example, FtM trans people worry about hair loss, the size of their hands, their height, the width of their shoulders, the size of their head, the depth of their voice, facial hair, general body hair - I understand that they also feel that their penis shouldn't be there, so much so that some even try to cut it off themselves.  This is what's so confusing, I think: it doesn't 'feel' like anything in particular to have less hair, to have wide shoulders, to have a hairy body. These are not things you feel and are normally aware of, unless you consciously think about these things (even then, you can only concentrate on them, there is no 'feeling' or sensation associated with the length of your hair, width of shoulders, etc.). It doesn't 'feel' like anything in particular to have a male body (a body with male secondary sex characteristics), and I have a very hard time believing that females can 'feel' what it's like to have a female body (a body with female secondary sex characteristics).  So I simply cannot understand: what does it feel like to 'be' of a certain sex, let alone of the opposite sex? Do trans people simply wish they had the sexual experiences of the other sex, rather than the sexual experiences that they currently have?   And it's still not entirely clear to me what it 'feels' like to 'be' of a certain gender: does it mean that you have say feminine interests, behaviors, and mannerisms? But what counts as 'feminine' is simply what is the norm for women, and just because some interests/behaviors/mannerisms/etc. are the norm for women doesn't mean that every woman has them - there are butch women, tomboys, etc. who are no less 'women' for having interests/behaviors/mannerisms/feelings/etc. that are not typical for women. In fact, when people say 'woman', I don't think they mean 'someone who has the interests/behaviors/mannerisms/feelings/etc. typical of females and other persons with the gender role of 'woman' ', I think they mean something much closer to 'female'. So when an FtM trans person says 'I feel like a woman in a man's body', I don't understand: do you mean to say that you feel like a biological female with female-typical interests/behaviors/mannerisms/etc. inside a biologically male body? That's incomprehensible to me, because I don't understand what it means to 'feel like a biological male (or female)'. Do you mean to say that you feel that you should have the sexual experiences of the opposite sex? I can sort of understand that, though I have a hard time understanding how one could imagine what it feels like to experience sexual intercourse as the opposite sex, and to specifically want that experience (I could understand though if you DON'T want the sexual experiences of your own sex, because you've experienced them already, and you might not like them). Do you mean to say that you feel that your interests/behaviors/mannerisms/feelings/etc. are more typical of the other sex, so you identify with members of the other sex because you feel that your personality is more similar to them than to members of your own sex? But then, why not say you're just non-binary, or even just say that you are cis-gendered but you don't have all the typical personality traits that are typical of your gender?   I simply don't understand what they mean. So when I heard that little piece of dialogue ('don't you feel like a woman?' 'No, I feel like myself.' 'well, exactly.'), that made absolutely no sense to me. I don't know what it's supposed to mean to 'feel like a woman',  and the 'well exactly' raises even more questions. What does it mean?",en,relativeinsight,2019-08-01T00:00:00,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

If I toy with the idea of one day for some reason I would wake up as a woman (and the different hormone levels didn't radically change how I behave) I THINK I would pretty much shrug and move on with my life much like I already do (after furiously masturbating for a few days with the new found parts off course). Getting rid of my body completely and live just as a consciousness is an idea far more appealing than change this fleshy shell I was born into. I have already lived most of life inside my own head and often feel eating and sleeping is a hassle with the having to interact with the outside world and everything.

If I can get the money together, especially after getting on hrt (had a friend who showed some hair coming back once she was several months in, so there is hope for -some- reversal... some at least), I'm going to look into some of those hair options where they take some from the lower back of your head and set it up on the top in a way that is supposed to look natural...

I'm bi, so you'd think I could relate, but I'd hate to say I really don't get it at all. For a long time I thought being trans was a mental illness, and sort of still do. I can get him being gay (which he is, by his own admission), because people like to fuck, have different tastes, and there's plenty of evidence suggesting that it's largely genetic (I think I can attest to that firsthand), and even him being more effeminate because, I mean who gives a fuck if he prefers painting his nails to playing football?  But I just don't get why someone would go to such great lengths to make themselves the opposite sex, or actually believe themselves to be it. I mean if you want to dress up and shit, fine. But to me there's a world of difference between that and 'I want to cut my dick off and swap it out for a non-functioning pussy'. He wants to transition, do the surgery and all that once he gets the money. As someone who wants to be a father, it just seems nonsensical and unnatural to me, even morally wrong in a sense, to give up your ability to have kids, or even get off, (no offense to you, but can you? Have you actually transitioned yet? I've heard the alternate sex organ they give you can't do that anymore) because he feels a certain way and might change his mind later. I mean....will he? How hardwired is this, and if you've transitioned, have you ever regretted your decision? This probably seems like a lot of questions, and I probably seem like a narrow-minded ass. But I'd most likely just say something that offends him or starts a fight if I tried being this blunt with him about how I felt.

What's so important about claiming the word 'woman' or believing in the idea of a transition? Even if you were to frame it as a male with a so-called 'feminized brain' wouldn't that still be fundamentally a male? Why adopt the gender binary for self-definition when you can be free of it and not have to artificially invade a sex class you do not belong to? Aren't you really just trying to bend reality to fit an idea it can't really fit because one cannot change their sex just their gender presentation? Wouldn't it be more non-conformist to admit your sex class but refuse to behave according to it's gendered expectations? Why don't you believe in learning to love your body as is without having to make radical changes to it? Why is it so important that you fit people's expectations of what you should be, such as  the issue with having a feminine voice rather than practicing and cultivating self-acceptance?  What's wrong with keeping your voice as is and looking feminine? Don't you think there's something wrong with caring so much what others think?

1194,"I've been looking into ethics and I kept going 'hang on a minute - this is all in Terminator 2!' - so I've been going back to that movie (watched a great 60 min presentation by 'Industry Workshops' on YoutTube from 11 months ago - gave me an overview of myths, story telling, visual narrative, and character arcs, but also how to engage lower and higher brain functions).   I started off with the stanford prison experiment (and the BBC re-run in 2002, which went differently but still ended up with tyranny). Then moved onto to Ethics of Care versus Ethics of Justice (Gilligan vs Kohlberg) and naturally went from that to thinking off a female mental institution experiment versus the male stanford prison experiment - thinking about Empathy and Relationships versus Power and Entitlement.... Things that feature in Terminator 2 (but is not represented in Sarah Connor's mental institution as a place of Empathy in contrast to the Stanford Prison Experiment as a place of Power - as Sarah's mental institution is shown as being no different to a Prison in that sense). Ethics of Care vs Ethics of Justice get chracterized along gendered lines - so maybe it's not a real distinction or it's platitudes ect?   I had already been researching gender identity in the brain though, which seemed to be down to a dominance of the Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis (BNST) in the 'reptilian' brain in males (driving masculine aggression and favouring action) as a result of oxytocin receptors in the BNST (that are fewer in females in the BNST) versus more reliance on the limbic cortex in the brains of females (allowing for more emotional cognition). These findings, if correct, are controversial because it would indicate that men are more adapted to deal with physical stress than women. And also that women have more of an ability to deal with emotional stress (the stereotype of the male flying of the handle with aggression when things go wrong versus the calmer female who tries to work through a problem)... These features of the brain appear swapped over in transgender individuals. I am not an expert though.   ...I've thought about this in terms of feminism and concluded that the goal of feminism should be to improve male and female mental health (regularly being aggressive reduces grey matter in the brain and leads to psychosis). The problem is that the BNST via oxytocin ties into social identity (mental memory and also muscle memory) - literally gender identity. So feminism requires more than just altering social constructs of gender but to succeed requirest males to compromise their prefered mode of being - something a gentleman should already be able to do.   As the BNST is less active in females (removing the BNST in males leads to more feminine type behaviour) I am less certain of where female gender identity arises from as it seems not a simple case of attributing it to the BNST (so called what causes transgenderism). However, new research indicates that memories form in mutliple areas of the brain at once to be later intergrated together to reinforce a memory. So it could be that females reliance on higher brain regions compared to males could be where the female gender identity resides? - as all memories require oxytocin, which is a social hormone.   Males do have more grey matter in their BNST and Amygdalae than females, whereas as females tend to have a thicker layer of grey matter in their cerebral cortex than males (also reflected in scans of transgender brains). Though this finding is complicated by the way grey matter converts to white matter in the process of 'trimming' as we develop - white matter being faster established neural connections developing from repeated activity. So it could be that in the case of the right hemisphere - relating to physical activity - in which this is more evident, that females just have untapped potential? But then isn't hemisphere activity related to amygdalae activity, which is more dominant on the right side in males - this also relates to sexuality as in homosexuals dominance of the left or right amygdala is swapped over. But then sexuality and gender identity are different (as you get homosexual trans men and women). White matter seems more important for sexuality (including peadophilia) - maybe the key to gender identity is in the grey matter (e.g. amount in different regions of the brain)? - both in the 'reptilian' brain and the cerebral cortex?",en,relativeinsight,2019-08-01T00:00:00,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

1203,"What is the 'Boon' for transgender people? I'm sure everyone is familiar with Star Wars - it was influenced a lot by Joseph Cambell's 'Monomyth', which was a generalised story arc of the Hero's/Heroine's Journey based on his observations of all the similarities of myths throughout the history of human cultures.   The 'Boon' is the goal or objective for the proganonist - such as destroying the Death Star for example...  The 'boon' is generally an achievement of both individual attainment and recognition by peers and a journey into adulthood generally as a respected member.   The Monomyth has three distinct sections: SEPARATION, INITIATION, and RETURN. Between each section is an event that creates a threshold moment - between Separation and Initiation Luke's aunt and uncle are murdered; between Initiation and Return Obi-Wan scarficies himself.   I think quite often for Transgender people there is a lot of pressure to 'stay on the farm' and get 'killed' by a Psychiatrist/Pyschologist Stormtrooper working within the system to prevent the transition from Separation to Initiation for the Transgender person - i.e. conform (die either spiritually or literally).  Obviously a problem is you can only get the 'Boon' if you play by the systems rules - if transgender people aren't even allowed to have the 'Boon' then how can they be part of the franchise?  Those who are lucky (or geniuses) or fight hard enough to tear themselves away from the ties that bind or just reach absolute breaking point between life and death, can find their own meaning in life and in a way that encompasses the human spirit - this may mean finding a higher purpose beyond the veil of the franchise and the system...   easier with the help of a mentor which is usually an experienced transgender person or transgender collective (their Obi-Wan) who knows how to get the system to work for transgender people.

1257,"I kant believe (sorry - bad joke) I can't believe I am typing this in a comment box on youtube, but, philosophically, is the cosmological string theory in physics transphobic? No seriously. I should explain that I have been attacked by a persistent TERF for about a month now on and off, and I ended up calling her a 'social darwinist'. I thought I'd read a bit more about the term and came across an unexpected link with 'Monism' and I though 'hmmm... don't I have monist views about cosmology?'. It is difficult for me to define exactly how I view the universe, but anyway I was more in favour of string theory over the multiverse theory (even though this theory makes sense in terms of quantum physics - 'everything that can happen does happen'). I guess I am a bit of a perfectionist, and I know that is bad for not just transphobia but viewing human beings in general. I also rejected descartes mind dualism... so does that mean I'm a monist - fuck? I'm a bastard. But hang on... There's existence pluralism (or priority plurism..  I have no idea), but basically the 'universe' in a monist view would have the cosmos made up of just one 'verse' or 'song'. Whereas as a multiverse would have 'multi-verses' or 'multi-songs' - perhaps infinitely many, like infinitely many ripples on a pond combining together...  that is actually more how I see the cosmos. I still think there is only one univese but I think it is made up of many verses combined (in a way much more abstract than the multiverse hypothesis - like the quantum approach.... it's just all in the maths). So I guess I hold a pluralistic view. But I hadn't really considered if how I view existence was affecting how I viewed everything else. I guess maybe it could help being less of a perfectionist? Maybe I need to also think about how I view the mind as well. That TERF is still at me...

1276,"Great video!  Changing the body to match the mind, or changing the mind to accept the body.  Is either more or less ethical depending on what the person wants?  But changing the body to match the mind using hormones also changes the mind.  I wonder if the bulk of suffers (if that is an appropriate term) of gender dysphoria would suffer it, if generalized gendered social expectations were different from what they are now.  But aren't those expectations, if they are really expectations in the current zeitgeist, built on generalized norms of behavioral characteristics that extend beyond social input and have a biological foundation?  I would think the biological foundation of gendered expectations would find strong evidence in the existence of gender dysphoria.  As in, (while there is much gray area in personality and behavior between the biological sexes) do males with gender dysphoria ever fit a stereotypical male behavioral template and vise versa or do they usually exhibit the behaviors of the other sex?    As a side note, I have caught on that there seem to be multiple meanings for sex and gender, while they are interchangeable have usually meant physical biology but also mean something different from physical genetic expression to encompass something different.  As in gender dysphoria, to my understanding, means to feel dysphoria about your genitals not who you are as a person (more masculine vs. feminine).  It seems that our feeling that we are a something in the driver's seat of a body, looking out from behind the eyes leads us to the belief that we are something more than our bodies.  That the mind has a sense of permanence that the body doesn't.  The same mechanism that gives most the belief in a soul or afterlife or reincarnation.  Therefore changing the body is of no consequence, where changing the mind would feel like changing the person into a different person.  It is near impossible to imagine changing the only thing you know, yourself.  Where the record of your changing body over time through age is there to see, the change in your mind through age can prove to be more elusive.  However, changing the mind to accept the body might not create a major change in personality, perhaps only a lining up of mind and body leaving the personality intact.",en,relativeinsight,2019-08-01T00:00:00,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

1317,"Thank you SO much for making this.  In my teens / early twenties, I struggled with gender identity.  I was born male, but didn't consider myself masculine, and in fact found most hyper-masculine behaviour to be repellent and scary.  I dabbled with transvestism, and found some sense in privately presenting as female, but never felt comfortable enough to take it public.  I'm in my late 30s now; I've made huge strides in reconciling my own masculine and feminine sides, and am happy identifying as male, even while there's still a 'female' part of me which goes unexpressed.  And, honestly, I've no idea *who* I would be now if I'd been exposed to the idea of transgenderism when I was younger.  All this to say: thank you thank you thank you for sharing your personal experience (and so entertainingly at that).

1321,"You know, this video isn't just being funny, entertaining and honest for the sake of a YouTube video. It's much more; this video is amazing. As someone who doesn't have any gender dysmorphia (that I know of at least, I'm the opposite of who you think of when you imagine 'perfectly normal and well-balanced' so it may play a role. I personally doubt it though for some reason) I can say that this really helps me understand what it must be like, even if I can never truly understand the full implications of the problem on someone who's going through/has gone through it. I think it might sound stupid at first, but I think the highest praise I can possibly give to a work such as this is: I get it. I understand now in a way that I didn't before. Thank you for broadening my empathetic vocabulary.  On a technical note, the video was done well. Most shots had a nice fore, middle, and background, but cleverly choosing to change that for the hallucination. The shots were symmetrical and visually pleasing or interesting for the most part, and this also had a sense of color and life that's rarely seen anymore (well, maybe you see it a lot on YouTube, but it feels fake, dishonest and usually disorganized with colors that don't match or convey a feeling that fits with the video, or some other reason. Take your pick, there's a million of them) It was more like the breadth and life of an Alejandro Jodorowski film. Plus, it had some very obvious, as well as some really subtle moments that were influenced by other great filmmakers and other artists. I now see your creative vision, and when I have disposable income, I imagine myself giving you money of patreon.  I do really hope that you do more content like this though. This was masterful Impressionism, excellent use of color, great placing and decent blocking, original ideas and methods of conveying feelings that need to be better understood, and so much more that can't be quantified from my critical perspective.      Incase my review of a YouTube video, (I know, a review of a YouTube video. Regardless of how good the video is, that's unquantifiably pathetic as a critic) here's the td;lr: Great video, watch it to get a better understanding of dysmorphia.

1330,when I was anorexic I used to keep journals with calorie numbers....I would use bracelets to make sure my upper arms were thin enough to fit what would fit around an average persons wrist.  I had certain rituals I would do every day to measure certain parts of my body. eg I decided my shoulders were too disproportionately big compared to the rest of my body. I failed exams due to checking these measurements and spent hours in the mirror going over these insane things...so ashamed that people would think i was vain...even though i hated myself. The more starved I got the more distorted my perception was. in hind sight...there was nothing abnormal about me. I Know Th is isn't the same as gender dysphoria...but I can relate so much to this video. For me it wasn't about fearing being the wrong gender...but being a woman as opposed to a girl. Having curves...having Boobs....which I used to flatten to make me less womanly. It was about staying a child. And believing that if I looked like one I wasn't sexually provocative.  It wasn't conscious. I just felt safer that way. I love you Contra. I hope these feelings ease AA they have for me,en,relativeinsight,2019-08-01T00:00:00,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

Even as a supporter and empathizer, I know I can never understand what goes on inside the mind of a trans person, not being trans myself, but I think I got a small insight. When I saw the 'why do I have hair here?' part I had tears in my eyes because I have a lot of hair in places no human should have hair (shaft and foreskin if you're wondering), and being a person of color, as a child i always felt it's because my ethnic group was inferior, less evolved, and are 'closer to animals'. It took me a long time to get myself out of that thinking. Still hate the hair though. :)   We are all disappointed with our bodies in some ways, but your video makes me think that gender dysphoria is all that disappointment on steroids and LSD, and all of it is perceived as how it takes away your body from its true gender. Good Lord, the cycle of being reminded of the flaws, depression, and forgetting long enough to be happy must be tiring. Too tiring. I've experienced some of that.  It must have been cathartic to point them out in public, instead of keeping them hidden.   I really don't know how to deal with my own body issues...I'm just hoping to find someone who actually LIKES the errors of my body. Maybe only then I can let go of it. I'm hoping the same for you.

As someone who by and large has to behave and present as a male, and who has experienced tons of Gender Dysphoria, I can relate to pretty much every single scene. I know what it's like to try on outfit after outfit, makeup, and everything else I can think of only to look in the mirror and see the most obviously masculine features. I know what it's like to despise the hair on my body which grows so quickly. I know what it's like to be rejected and made to feel worthless for being unable to be sexual with partners because of that. The part that hit the most home, as a singer and musician, was where you sat in front of the microphone discussing how your voice didn't sound feminine. That felt like it could've been me, to an exact tee. My voice is actually probably the worst, come to think of it... it's impossible to feel like I will ever be who I want, or express myself how I want. And all the people who tell me I should just do it or just be myself don't get that it isn't so much other's perception or their support or lack thereof that affects me, it's that I know that I cannot be in any way feminine convincingly, as much as I might want, least of all too myself. I...I don't know, I've rambled too much... this just hit me very hard...

So much of this BS that you've had like a ton of lead over you all your life ebbs away and you achieve a kind of calm you never thought you could have. I first took estro about 14 years ago and it was a revelation to me, all the emotional ill-fitting pieces just worked when I just let them sort out by themselves. Transitioning is not always pretty, but it allows you to become yourself and mostly (it takes time) forget about all the dysphoric nonsense. As for the voice.. I had (technically have) a baritone like you but I worked it into the voice I've been using for the last decade and a half and  I never have trouble passing. I even worked over the phone without a hitch. I still don't like my voice that much, and I really, really wish it was a pretty singing voice, but it works and goddamn it it's mine. It just takes some work to hit the right place, but when you do, it works like a charm. The training also allows you to extend your voice a ton.

I don't have gender dysphoria and am pretty vanilla when it comes to my gender expression, but I do know what it's like to hate one's own body and to think, 'This can't be my body, this can't be real.' The last lyrics of the closing song, 'Is this even real,' really drove that home for me. I used to be 100 lbs at 5'4', and a professional art model. After a couple of years, my lifestyle of...indulgences...caused me to develop adult-onset, life-threatening asthma. The meds I needed for my asthma subsequently caused me to gain about 40 lbs over the course of 2 years. It was really traumatizing, I couldn't even get out of bed the first day I saw stretch marks on my body. The calls for modeling jobs waned, and then stopped entirely. I didn't even want to have sex anymore because all I could think about was how fat I looked to my partner (which is not what he thinks at all).

I will always say that I envy everyone with a platform upon which they can express their inner thoughts and ideas. I never really cultivated an artistic pursuit of my own, but you (Contrapoints) and many other artists have shown me that it's still possible. Seeing the development of your artistic expression grow over time has really inspired me.  About the video itself, I feel like I identify with some of this more than I've realized. I haven't experienced major dysphoria, but there's definitely a minor form of it I feel sometimes. I'm very uncomfortable with too much masculinity and I try to minimize it somewhat and exaggerate my more feminine traits to help balance it out. It's very striking seeing some of my own thoughts in this movie being expressed (even if they're to an extreme), and I feel like I understand dysphoria much more.  How would the general population see something like this? Hopefully they feel as uncomfortable as they were intended to feel, because it's all about delivering a subjective experience.   Anyway I basically love you, Contrapoints. This video is amazing. You're amazing. Keep doing more of whatever it is you do, please.",en,relativeinsight,2019-08-01T00:00:00,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

1506,"Hopefully without sounding too prescriptive here, because I'm really not trying to be, I think it would help alleviate some of the pain you're feeling to at least explore the possibility of HRT. There's a community on reddit for DIY HRT (/r/transDIY), so you don't even need a doctor, which I know you've said was one of the reasons you were avoiding it. And you don't need a 'full' dose. You can control it yourself as long as you're monitoring your own levels. And you don't even need to add estrogen, right away. You could take justan anti-androgen for a couple months and see how you feel without male testosterone levels before committing or not.  Maybe you'll discover that your brain likes testosterone better, after all, and it's just physical things, which can be changed, that are the source of your pain. Maybe you'll find that a more female hormonal balance is better for you psychologically. You won't know until you find out, right?  And with all that being said. I'm not saying 'change your body.' I'm saying that I empathize very, very strongly with the emotions in this video, and from both my own experiences as a trans person as well as countless other trans people's experiences, both binary and non-binary, HRT does *a lot.* It's not just about the physical changes, it touches something a little deeper than that, as well. Something less tangible but at the same time very visceral than body dysphoria.  And if it helps at all, your voice is already pretty androgynous. It really is. But if you did want to feminize it a little more, then I really don't think it would take you very long to train it if you followed a good guide. Another trans community on reddit (seriously you should spend some time exploring the trans subreddits, a lot of them are super great) is /r/transvoice. There are guides people have posted on how to help feminize your voice the right way. It takes some practice, but you're a at a great starting point already. I think you'd probably have pretty quick results in finding a voice you're more comfortable with.  Anyway. I've rambled enough and you probably won't read this. But if you do, know that there are a lot of people who know a lot of what you're going through right now. Don't shy away from the experiences of those who have been down that road before.

Truly, everything about it, from the witty and honest script, the editing, the music, the gorgeous lighting, your outfits (that all-pink one in the strawberry eating sequence is so fucking good, my jaw dropped) - this an absolutely stellar piece of filmmaking. Thank you for being so courageously open and vulnerable on this way.   And I'm sorry that you've been struggling so much. As a trans person, I understand how fucking much dysphoria sucks. Everything you said here resonates with me so strongly.   It's my deep hope that you'll be able to see all the things that make you feel like less of a woman right now as more of one later on. You can be a woman with thinning hair, with body hair, with a deep voice, tall, with a dick - that's fine. None of those things define womanhood. And as a bigender fella that wants to be seen as more masculine, I get wanting to adjust your body and feeling such terrible guilt and shame when you can't be as malleable as you hope to be. But it's important to remember that gender is defined by us. We make it what we want.   All I'm trying to say, and probably failing at, is that I so deeply wish that you one day find peace in yourself, and love the magnificent woman as well as the wonderful man and all other forma of gender you may happen to be that you are. You are a brilliant mind and a creative soul before anything else. All my love. ",en,relativeinsight,2019-08-01T00:00:00,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

So my main goal is just to make art, but I also hope that depicting an individual experience of dysphoria in detail helps non-trans people understand it better.  I should say that this does not represent everyone's experience of gender dysphoria. AFAB (assigned female at birth) people will have a very different experience. People further into their transition will have a different experience.  Also, I identify as genderqueer, which is a complicating factor that I don't completely know how to make sense of. My dysphoric feelings are pretty 'binary' in the sense that it's mostly being non-female that hurts me, rather than being non-androgynous. The one really non-binary moment of this thing is the blues song, which is kind of a celebration of gender non-conformity and embrace of a masculine trait (my voice).  For people curious about the state of my gender situation, I'll just say for now that I'm still figuring it out. But enough about me, let's talk about me.
