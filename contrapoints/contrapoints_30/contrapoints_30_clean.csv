"It's very scary when you say 'class and racial distinctions are excluded from the diagram altogether', because it may only mean race and class interfere in the formation or determination of sex, gender and orientation. Of course being, for example, a poor cis woman in NYC is different from being a middle-class cis woman in the Republic of Myanmar, in ways and levels that doesnt even fit to mention here, but still none of them is less cis or less a woman , at least in terms of rigths and validity of feelings and interests, or it should be. Since the diagram, simplistic as it may be, purpotedly applies for the entire species, class and race really must not be taken into consideration, exactly because they dont apply for the entire species. I daresay that anything that purpotedly apply for the entire species should never take into consideration cultural elements, lest it fall into the same framework of thinking as, for example, eugenics, physiognomy, maternal impression or phrenology.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I feel so bad for this guy, his parents and society have completely fucked him up. The fact he thinks he will be happier if he pretends to be woman is very sad. Having a dick and balls makes you a man having a vagina that when inseminated by a mans sperm you can create a child makes you a woman that's the one and only definition of sex. You can say all this other bullshit determines your sex but thats dishonest and complete bullshit. You can site the .00001 % of the time when these definitions don't fit but that changes nothing, in those extremely rare cases then you can use other things to determine the sex but that is only for those extremely rare cases.

No one gives a shit if you are a man and want to be a woman or vice versa, but trying to claim it's somehow normal and good thing is so wrong it's not funny. Im also sorry I have to say this, but I don't want these people anywhere near my daughter kids have enough bullshit to navigate through they don't need a freak like this putting insane thoughts in their head.

"The conventional genders are for societal organization simplicity, from my understanding, but now that we have more time to philosophize as regular peoples: we bring those constructs into question and point our how flawed they are relative to truth; and all the injustices those simplicities have created from the older generations being lazy with legal semantics for political rulership.   The problem with the modern philosophy of all this is that it is impractical to implement the inevitable infinity-system, and too much to put into realistic legal semantics without causing the opposite desirable effect; at least with the way that the modern Left have been trying to do so anyway.  The older ways create injustices to the minorities, but the modern way is to create injustices against the majority.  The best solution would be get rid of all of the injustices, but _that_ is what many from both sides fear: a society that does not give a f* at all and destroys all diversity in the legal semantical context by enforcing universality in their legality; pansexuality & either 1 gender or genders not based on personal & biological constructs, but rather on something like 'Internal Citizen'/'External People', and effectively 1 gender otherwise by not giving a f*, and in doing so acquires equality across all legal spectrums.  But _that_ upsets too many people to accept. IMHO","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"If a person has a vagina, ovaries, xx chromosome etc. at birth, then it is a female, if they have a penis, xy chromosome etc. (again at birth) they are male. Any other combination of this is an abnormality. Using your own statistics we see that the most common disorder of the list would be 'Late onset adrenal hyperplasia'. Say we This occurs in 1 out of 1000 people, or .1%. Using .1% of the population and making a conclusion based on the .1% would be scientifically incorrect as there is not enough evidence to support that claim. The standard significance level of .05 or 5%, tells us that the probability of an event occurring must be at least .05 to be able to impose a conclusion of that upon the population. Any other of these disorders have even a lower probability so the same applies to them.    There are 2 genders, male and female. Gender is a biological term. Using gender as a cultural term is lack of creativity to define your own term. Defining a person's gender by the way they act, feel etc. is wrong by definition. Cultural aspects don't define your gender, your biology does. If a male acts very 'girly' or dresses like a 'girl' or whatever you people say, doesn't mean they are girl. First of, defining certain actions as masculine and others a feminine is not supported by science and it's entirely cultural. This is why imposing those sets of rules conflict with scientific ones. If you want to create a new term that explains these cultural values then go ahead, but it is inappropriate to force those beliefs upon science even though they are literally incorrect.  Now fuck off and stop making conclusion about entire species based on a handful of outliers.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"When you argue that a primary binary view does not want to adjust to reality, you're very comfortably ignoring reasonable explanations that are offered, which is unexpectedly dishonest of you. It does make sense that you want to ignore that, as on one side, one would be approaching vague and difficult definitions of 'natural' and 'normal', on the other hand there are many people that take offense to such perspectives and explanations. You could argue for example that 'normal' humans 'naturally' have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and that down-syndrome for example is a sickness and a 'deviation' from 'normality'. In the same way, swyer syndrome is generally viewed as a deviation from normality, something that is 'normally' not characteristic of human beings and does not define them. In this way, those 'other genders' or however you wanna define them, can be viewed as 'deviations from normality' or sicknesses, that would 'normally' not occur 'naturally'. Many people object to such perspectives, as this was for example used for explaining homosexuality and transsexuality. The occurence of homosexuality and transsexuality may be deviations from some kind of normally but do occur naturally and have for as long as we can tell. In particular transsexuals take offense to the view that their condition may be viewed as a sickness or disorder. I do however believe that that would be unproblematic, so long as people aren't fixated on it as something negative or bad. It's a kind of difference from some kind of normality with advantages and disadvantages. Proposing tons of different genders that are always changing does not some like something practical to me, in particular when this kind of understanding of gender overlaps so much with what people traditionally just mean with 'personality'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Interesting why there is not one single woman who  - started a war, committed a mass murder, was the perpetrator in a mass shooting & including school shootings, was behind murders (such as charles manson), committed bombings, and women are almost always the people who (and I don't like to say victim, survivor is acceptable) the targets of revenge porn, are the survivors of rape, sexual harassment, domestic relationship/intimate partner violence.  Now don't misunderstand me, there are certainly men who are the survivors of rape and domestic partner abuse/violence. It is the Vast Majority of women who are on the receiving end of these types of crimes.   And revenge porn is also seldom done by women.  It it sad & frustrating that most often women are hurt at the hands of men, then things like victim blaming happen on top of that.  There are both good & bad people that are both men & women.

"Okay, so, as a cis-man who is trying to be nice and 'woke', as someone who has trans friends and family and who cares about their well-being and about having a clear and healthy understanding of gender... 'How do I explain this to kids?' Now, I don't mean the above question the way most people do, like a sort of 'I don't know how to explain this to my kids, so _stop existing! (angry face)'_ I mean it like this: When I was a kid, gender was taught to me as: 'Boys have penises, and girls have vaginas.' and that's what I accepted. As I grew up and learned about the diversity of gender expressions, I learned: 'Men are those who identify as men, and women are those who identify as women.' and I am fine with that definition.  I accept it. But.... what if a four-year-old asked me: 'Hey, agiar2000, what's the difference between a boy and a girl?' and I said: 'A boy is a child that says they're a boy, and a girl is a child that says they're a girl.' and they say: 'Okay, but... which am I?' and I say: 'Whichever you feel like, or something in between or some entirely different gender, if that's what you feel.' and they say: 'But, how do I know what word I feel like, if I don't know what those words mean?' and I say: 'You're weirdly articulate for a four-year old.  But anyway, I don't know what to tell you.  They're social constructs.' and they say: 'Social constructs meaning what?' and I say: 'Damn it, I'm trying to be woke, here!  I'm sorry!  I don't know!  I don't know what it _really_ means to be male, female, boy or girl!'  Maybe someone can help articulate this better to me.  What would _you_ tell a child who wants to know what gender means?  What is an age-appropriate introduction to the concept for a toddler?  I promise I'm not looking for an argument.  I genuinely want to hear some other perspectives on this, such as from trans folk, non-binary folk, and others who are better versed than I.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"1) The fact that  some natural phenomena can be defined as taking place on a spectrum (like an evolutionary chain) doesn't necessary imply that everything does. It is true that every change, movement, dynamic between a state A and B can be read as running along a spectrum, but it is short of being true that every existing state of affairs, or phenomenon or object happens to switch one another. I can imagine person A exchanging all his molecules to person B until they fully switch their respective identities; under this hypothesis A and B can be conceived to be on a spectrum, but to assert that two existing human beings are on a spectrum is just non sense. Similarly, asserting that female and male (or woman or man) can be ideally put on a spectrum, doesn't imply that they actually are, because it is still to be proved that a shift is possible between the former and the latter. Of course, through surgery or therapies a similar change can take place, but this leaves unanswered two questions: is that actually a change from being a female (or woman) to being a male (or man)? Should such change take place?  2) Answering the first question is strictly related to my second contention, because it is a matter of definitions. If I understood your words correctly, you assumed that words are signs used to refer to objects, subject to several requirements or conditions that mirror the features of the objects we usually label with such names (It is a complicated territory of linguistic philosophy, I would be glad if you corrected me should I have misconstrued your view). I may concede this is tenable (even if a little bit circular: the conditions for the application seem to be at the same time the outcome of the application). You also asserted that it is impossible to define once for all every condition of every definition. I can concede also this. The point is that from everything you stated doesn't certainly follow that the construction of a word for the intent of its application in a specific case can be arbitrary or unwarranted. Given a certain definition of woman that follows the aforementioned conditions, why are we supposed to use it with regard to individuals who fall more or less short of the definition? It is not a given that I should use the word 'woman' for referring to individuals that do not have neither ovaries or XX chromosomes, assuming that I previously included these conditions among those necessary for the word to apply. It seems to me that you are taking as a given that transexual woman are to be defined woman and, on the ground of this assumption, you argue that the chromosome based definition of woman is flawed because it doesn't encompass them. But, respectfully, I think you are committing a petitio principii here, that is to say you are taking as a premise for your conclusion something that you are actually supposed to prove, i.e.: that transexual women are actual women.   3) As to intersexual people or other sex related anomalies the issue it is definitely more complicated, and I acknowledge it is not my field. However, I can make two contentions that do not require any specific expertise on this fascinating topic.  Firstly, even assuming that there are individuals that for the aforementioned conditions can't be labelled neither as woman or men in accordance with the standard definition, and assuming that, even after a strict scientific scrutiny, it doesn't emerge that they might fit in one of them, this doesn't necessary provide any ground for gender theories. Indeed, acknowledging the existence of intersexual people compels us to redefine 'woman' and 'man' so as to encompass also this people or, in alternative, to create new definitions. What this fact doesn't allow us to do is setting forth definition fully detached from any biological ground. In fact intersexuality refers to a variety of conditions or anomalies that are deep rooted in biological and genetic features. In other terms: maybe we overrun a strictly binary definition of sex, but it would be a surpass well confined within biological reality, not leaving any room for a social definition of it.  Secondly, whether the existence of intersexual is an argument for transgenderism is really disputable. You used (at least in one case) the word condition yourself, underscoring that these are anomalies that amount to pathology or run on the borderline of it. They shouldn't be held to be the criterion against which measure the paradigm of the biological and conceptual relationship of genders.  4) I don't know whether gender is or not a social construct. To be frank, it seems to me that the most feasible hypothesis it that it is so, at least to a certain degree, but being also rooted in biological features. My point is different. If gender is a social construct, it would be only as a complicated set of patterns of behaviors, social models, preferences, attitudes. This may explain why some people prefer to adhere to some behavioural paradigms rather than others, but it can hardly explain those individuals who feel they are born with 'the wrong body parts'. It seems to me we are talking about issues that deeply differ in substance one another. Indeed, even accepting the suggested distinction between sex and gender, people who accept to pass through often painful therapies to change their physical features are not just adopting a different social model, they are affecting the most immediate and direct physiological factors being expressed by their chromosomes. If they are not changing sex, they are definitely doing something more than adopting a different gender intended as a social construct. This is to me biggest flaw of every gender theory.  5) All your arguments are fascinating, but appear to be more theoretical speculations rather than actual evidence based theories.   Personally, I remain skeptical as to those set of assumptions usually labelled as gender theory. And even if, under a legal and ethical perspective, I abhor every form of discrimination, I can't sincerely rule out that transgenderism is not a fully healthy system of belief (or whatever you want to define it). And that was the answer to the second question of my point N. 1)  p.s.: did I have to put a trigger warning somewhere? I am Italian, this is not a thing among us yet...luckily.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"People who believe in a gender (or sex) spectrum just don't ever get it. People born with abnormal chromosomes are usually deformed, suffering from mild to severe mental and physical disabilities. They are statistical outliers and therefore do not shape the common-use term we use when we say 'male' or 'female'.  Also the term 'gender' is a word invented by Dr. Money to describe /societal/ roles people play based on their sex. Females predominately display feminine traits and therefore shape their own societal norm, same with males displaying masculine traits. It's written into human's DNA. We are hard-coded to live certain ways. That is the statistical norm. That is the majority.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"im gay. and gender to me (before the trans community hijecked the word) means 'do your produce eggs or sperm.' here is the thing. as a gay person there is nothing the opposite gender can do to them selves to make me love them sexually. im not into them. i dont care how many operations they have. i accept anyone of the same gender no matter if they wear dresses or a suit and tie. makeup, or no makeup. im not attracted what they look like, im not attracted to how masculine or feminine they are. im attracted to their body and what their body is. is their body physically the same as mine? then i like them. that means internally too. i happen to be a man so they need to have balls and they need to be able to make sperm. there is nothing a woman can do to make me attracted to her. no amount of hormones or surgery can make her into a he. she will always be a she. unless she removed her reproductive organs, then she will be an 'it' and not a he or she.  saying all that, i can love 'anyone' emotionally. but i have to be true to myself. i would rather live who i am, rather then who i am not. if i could, id probably change myself into a female. being male is nice and everything, but i like males so for me it would be easier to be female. but i cant do that. it just isnt possible. that would be me living a lie. i am a male and i like males. that is who i am.  also here is a simple way to answer the question of 'who you are' if you wanna know what gender you are. look in your pants. but if your asking who you are as a person. that is for you to fill in and anything at all can be places in that void. the only solid thing you cant easily change is what is in your pants. you can cut it off, you can reshape it but that doesnt change much. that just takes away from who you are  rather then adding to it.   i will personally accept trans when a complete and total transformation can be made. when you dont have to take pills. when you can go from a man to a woman and bear children by making eggs. even at that point i still think there is something to be lost when you change.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"4:56 To be fair, picky biologists, to my knowledge at least, don't characterize biological sex by sex chromosomes (maybe if we're talking about Drosophila). I thought most biologists and scientists in related fields viewed sex determination in humans as based on the presence/absence of the SRY gene (primary sex characterist genes). This is why people can be XX and be phenotypically male and XY and phenotypically female. To be fair, if you go by this logic, you will end up with 3 sexes instead of just 2 (to my knowledge aneuploidy and mosaicism of the Y chromosome or ovotesticular disorder cause other forms of intersex in humans). This is all the more reason for why humans need the concept of gender. Unless you're working in a lab that in some way deals reproductive biology, genetics, or something like that, I just don't see a practical every day use for biological sex.

"I'm sorry in advance Contra but I have a question that might be triggering or ignorant. I just thought I'd ask and get some answer, no matter how harsh. So basically there's this one person I know from twitter who is very open about their being trans, and non-binary. What I'm confused about however is that they have the appearance and all the physical characteristics of a regular cis man. I understand they claim to be non-binary but isn't this just pretend in a way, since they're not making an effort to look less 'cis male' (whatever that might be, I understand its pretty stupid to say that)? I'm not trans myself but I had serious dysmorphia when I was younger and in general don't really define myself by my gender. Back then my ONLY wish was passing for the opposite gender. So I can't understand someone not doing that and being happy with people misgendering them because they're not giving any outer sign that they're of another gender. Maybe I'm wrong to think like this, IDK. I'm just wondering what your answer would be. Thanks for your help.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Wait. So if gender and the like don't exist, then how can we expect anyone flipping and transitioning through these emipheral boundaries to gain rights? Then they're compaing about nothing? So consequencially they're also being attacked for no reason. But this lends barely anything to the cause. People shouldn't hurt people, and I think perhaps Trans people should be carful to screw around with the most complex systems on the palnet, because they have an identity crisis and are living in accordance and putting a lot of emotional emphasis on something you claim not to exist?   That's another issue. Masculinity and feminity clearly come from somewhere, they are expressed because there is archetypal significance to these themes. They exist psychologically and are brought more into reality by the biology. Its hard to say what exactly they are but clearly they exist. This is clear in any degree of analytical psychology. Should we let this control us? I don't believe so. Therefore both sides are at fault in a way. Not that people struggling with identity should be punished, but they are campaigning around something that doesn't really exist, gender, because of percieved roles created by general conciousness. And the people prosecuting the former are just assholes.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Love the way you talked about how language is insuficient to define just what things actually are. This happens 'cause words are not tied to things, but to the idea of the thing. Saussure said language was sound with meaning, but I'm inclined to think, like Chomsky, that language is actually meaning with sound. That is to say: what you mean precedes the way you say it because language actually began as only a way of reflecting on what you perceive and not of communicating it (and that is pretty obvious once you think about evolution theory, given that language and such traits can only be the product of mutation - which means there was a time in which only a selected few had the 'Language Faculty' and therefore a time in which there was no social conventions about the way sounds should be arranged to mean things) . Also, the way you say it is tied down by a certain number of rules that dictate meaning inside a certain context and by a limited but everchanging vocabulary. Words like 'transgender', for instance, did not exist for a long time, and that does not mean that transgender people did not exist, only that people didn't know the proper way to deal with this and therefore didn't include it in their language, probably causing great suffering on those who felt that their existence was null or who felt like they didn't belong anywhere. Luckily for us, language is also the way to preserve and evolve human shared knowledge and it won't be long before people actually learn to accept those changes in vocabulary that represent a change in the very way we think. It is inevitable. No amount of bigots can stop that. P.S.: just found your channel like yesterday and I'm loving it. You truly are a great communicator.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Don't pretend that every human social construct has the same fluidity and uncertainess. Gender is a social construct with rather strong boundaries as it is tied to the observable mechanism in mammals which requires binary 'non-fluid' agents: one carrying the baby, the other fertilizing the egg. Sex variants can be considered as malfunctions of this mechanism. You can define Gender as you want, of cours,e there is no essential or correct definition. A new Gender definition which lumps together well-established distinct and related categories (biological sex, gender roles, gender identity) just seems to add some bluriness for the sake of turning gender from a descriptive into a semi-normative category.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Gender is whatever each culture wants it to be, though yes, due to our tendency to dichotomize,  it has been pretty binary in most cultures( there are a few exceptions if you care to look them up).

People really need to leave those people alone and stop using them as evidence of your 'sex does not objectively exist' ideology. I say that as a liberal scientist.  The combination of the genes expressed and hormones are not optimum to result in the complete and formation of naturally FUNCTIONAL gonads that requires the sex selective biochemical pathways. And yes I can mark them as incomplete if the product does not result in being fully functional same way can mark a person born with no functional kidney inconpletely (only in that case its acyually fatal).

"Well I still think that the gender binary model makes the most sense, even philosophically.  For example if you want to take it to the extreme every person that has ever existed has a different gender. I think that gender has to do specifically with biological functions. What comes after that is sexuality (your attraction to others and to your self) wich in my opinion is what those dirty french philosophers call ' gender' . It is possible that this whole new idea of gender is just a missanderstandig caused by how poor human languages are. Maybe there isn't a word with wich to describe how you feel in your own body. And the roles that society puts on people make things even more confusing. But gender is for sure not the right word to describe that feeling.  Even I don't feel like a human sometimes (maybe I'm autistic I don't even know).  So to end all this: be who you think you are and try to be happy with your self . And to avoid confusion stop putting labels on your self. People will accept you for who you are but they won't accept you changing their vocabulary just for you.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Came here to understand what could be a form of definition of womanhood. They ultimately seems to abide most willingly by the rule of ''Feeling to fit into the body of a woman'' But isn't the whole point that biological sex isn't always intertwined with gender?!   Another definition is '' Gender is a performance, a series of imitative behaviours''.  BUT WHAT ARE THEY!??!?!?! WHAT ARE THE BEHAVIOURS?! Are they socially constructed ??? Then WHY do we even have gender if they are arbitrary definition to define individual? It doesn't help to have gender or transgender. It usurps behaviours from one gender to another. As if ''caring'' had to any else to do then being experienced through  ''caring people''. As if 'courageous' should be attributed to any one except  ''courageous people''.   Why.

"Bravo. I have a thought though. I preface by saying I really don't give a shit about who wins the competition of ideas so much as how the game is played. Where I see a potential disconnect regarding the definition of sex by the thoughtful scientific right and the thoughtful scientific left is the intended scope when talking about sex as binary or nonbinary. When the right says binary they're really describing something bimodal, and when the left (and you in this video in a well put way) describes the inherent lack of precise definition due to the variability of the pieces of the modes being mixed and matched, they're kind of skipping over the baseline that all the pieces that are mixed and matched are themselves binary - which gives rise to the continuum in the bimodality. I.e., having x or y chromosomes in and of themselves may not define sex, but they are binary choices inside of a complex bimodal system. So the right is always like hey, you're denying the modes, so all this nonbinary talk is nonsense (They don't say that, I'm paraphrasing my idea of the subtext of what they're actually saying), which is an obvious logical overreach. And the left is so busy showing how all the parts can mix and match to create an obviously nonbinary spectrum that they never talk about the binary qualities of the parts themselves. Unless I'm forgetting sex characteristics that are not divided into the male/female bimodality. Like is there a sex characteristic that is not male or female? I mean, it literally wouldn't be sexy.. uh.. paradox? I'm no pro. Anyway, you brain good. I'd love your thoughts but I know this is a late comment on an old video. Best of luck :-) P.S. I'd like to apologize for my use of 'left and 'right'. It's also a bimodal, not binary, system.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

There has to be middle ground here.) and that the gender you're trying to identify with, won't recognize you as one of their own (which again is social and I won't say that it should be respected as long as I can see evidence where trans people are being recognized as the gender they identify with among those normalized gendered groups) OR can we really just be chill with just saying 'Well its weird but it works so lets roll with it' Cuz that's what I'm doing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

That doesn't mean other mixtures of biological sex and gender aren't possible. I think shitlords get so caught up on 'only 2 genders' because these distinctions can initially seem overly abstract and subtle, so they think this is all a word game designed to show off lefty-cred and intentionally stifle the right by calling them transphobic if they don't find these concepts immediately intuitive.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I think that in the part of biological sex, evolution must be taken into account. In sexual reproduction, two individuals with two different sex cells make an embryo. This, I think, explains why a binary concept of sex can be uphold. Intersex people can be only classified as conditions because (as far as I know, which is little) they are usually sterile.  Think about it this way: why did the concept of sex gained traction, not only in humans, but in animals? Because of sexual reproduction. Biology doesnt work without evolution.   This raises another interesting point: because of this, do males and females naturally have distinct behaviors? If we think about evolution, many scientists say that there are on average. This is because sperm is created more rapidly, are much smaller, and live much less than their egg counterpart. This is thought to urge males into a more competitive state, where the best reproductive strategy for them is to have sex much more frequently than women. This can have some basis to gender being related to sex, and therefore binary.  However, social and psychological effects on humans is an important part, and so I dont know how to separate them. Maybe the social influence is so strong that it ends being much more important than biology. And gender identity, expression, etc. Are just new concepts without a clear scientific consensus.  In conclusion, I think there is enough evidence to at least doubt the traditional gender roles.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"In response to 5:15:  You are confused. Breasts have nothing to do with defining biological sex. They are sex characteristics, physiological features that are used to recognize sex, they are in no way part of the definition. Literally no scientist on Earth thinks a female person becomes less female following a mastectomy. What is this strawman you're trying to build here?  Chromosomes determine sex. To say XY individuals are female is tautological; 'female' literally means 'has XY chromosomes' and absolutely nothing else. That is the only definition of that word.  This 'preconceived scheme' is part of those hard sciences you alluded to before, and the existence of intersex individuals does absolutely nothing to ablate this foundation, any more than the existence of mutations demonstrates that there is no such thing as 'species'. Science is not prescriptive, it is descriptive. Calling basic biology 'bad science' is ridiculous.  And you don't even need any of this bullshit for your actual point, that's the really silly part. The existence of biological sex and its validity doesn't detract from your arguments on gender.     In response to the argument about the value of gold/money: This is a perfect illustration of the establishment 'progressive' attitude: a profoundly conservative position that serves to enforce and perpetuate the very structures of oppression you claim to oppose.   Gold is worthless. Money is worthless. The worth of these objects is a lie that is forced on people by a system that uses these values to manipulate their behavior.  Just like gender.   The solution is not to create a hundred intermediary categories between 'man' and 'woman'. The solution is to stop thinking in those terms entirely. Reinforcing the notion that gender is 'real' and that it is normal and expected for individuals to internalize gendered understandings of themselves is deeply harmful.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You're completely misusing the Dawkins thought experiment you're referring to, in the most retarded way possible. It's really ironic how you're using science as a theme here, while having no understanding of the science you're referring to. Biological sex, and sexual maturity (what you would call the difference between a child, and a man, or woman,) are not the same as evolution, which is what the Dawkins example was referencing. Biological sex is a binary, taxonomical classifications are a spectrum. No matter how fucked up your sex organs are, you produce eggs, sperm, or sometimes, you produce neither, but you never produce another vessel of passing on genetic information besides eggs, or sperm. Evolution takes millions of years, developing an intersex condition happens during a child's development in the womb, in a single generation, they're not close to being the same things.  Also the term 'man' has various connotations, like 'woman,' if you're talking about how society views a person, sometimes people reach adulthood, without people seeing them as a (mentally,) mature man or woman, ever. On the other hand, if you're talking about a man, or woman, just in terms of the physical stage in life, there's a very clear line, it goes, newborn, infant, toddler, child, predolescent (slightly prior to, and during puberty,) adolescent (after puberty,) and then adulthood. The new, hippy dippy, retarded snowflake generation seems to think it's a good idea to keep pushing adulthood farther, and farther into people's old age. They view college age adults as children, and treat them as such, so they start acting as such, throwing tantrums about pronouns, for example. I'll call you a 'her,' or a 'she,' if that's what you want, and you pay me mutual respect, but I don't owe you a fucking thing, least of all being expected to remember all this zee, zir, zerself horseshit, because you want to play pretend at the age of 25.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"while i like this video, there is a total lack of discussion about the scientific research and forming consensus on gender and specifically how trans people fit in.  In particular, neurophysiological studies - namely MRI scans and autopsies, show that there is a section of the brain that is gendered and that trans people tend to have brains more similar to their identified gender rather than what they were assigned at birth.  additionally, there wasn't even a discussion on fetal development and how sex and gender are developed.    i do not prescribe to gender being socially created, as there is sufficient evidence and research to support that gender physically resides in the brain.  This also lends itself neatly to the current theory that gender dysphoria is caused by a mismatch in the physical gender of the brain, what it expects and how the body developed.  furthermore, this explanation of the gender residing in the brain explains how come cross sex hormone therapy (HRT) is so effective in treating gender dysphoria.  if gender were a social construct, then HRT would be ineffective and actually quite harmful.  i do appreciate the video, its information, and artistry.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"It somewhat confuses me that the term used for everything seems to be ''gender'', even when mostly talking about sex as in the physical body. How can a surgery reassign your gender? - Is it some kind of horror movie brain surgery? As was pointed out gender is not strictly binary and the distinctions have been more and more blurred in the last few decades. Imagine your average day presenting as your biological sex, you get up, shower, eat, go to work or whatever, speak to other people etc. Now imagine the same day, but with the body of the opposite sex. Did any of those 2 versions act in a transgendered way or were both just showing perfectly acceptable social behavior? If you are a very manly man the second version might be seen tomboyish or if you a very girly woman the second version might be seen as a bit of a sissy, but it is not like you wouldn't come across people that are like that normally.  It seems to me that the crux of the transgender issue is just wanting to have the body of the opposite sex. If humans were a species that could perform sequential hermaphroditism that would not be a problem, but we are not and we can just change some of the sexual dimorphisms with our current technology. If it was impossible to tell a transgender woman apart from a cis woman I dont think there would be all this drama about it. You can easily see that trend if you compare the reactions of the general public to young transgender women that pass reasonably well to people that transition in their 40s or 50s and often cannot pass at all.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Evil pinko non-binary queer person here. Judith Butler also observed that sex is actually gender all the way down. What she means is that prevailing ways of organizing body parts and behaviors into 'male,' 'female,' or 'intersex' are actually cultural customs; growth hormones, body parts, and chromosomes may contribute to one's behavior and gender identity but do not produce straightforward effects or meanings in themselves. While Natalie/Contra hints at this perspective, I wish she would give it more attention. J.B. Preciado discussed how growth hormones were gendered in the first half of the 20th century, and Anne-Fausto Sterling has basically revealed the shoddiness of supposed gender or sexual differences in brain imagery. Differences in people exist and have some biological component to varying degrees; our ways of classifying them and the assumptions we tie to those classifications are artificial. I just worry that straight cis people are using science to contain and limit their own possibility of being attracted to multiple genders or exploring other gender identities and presentations.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"First of all, hardly any scientifically literate person sees sex or gender as a rigid binary and most people don't see either as an evenly distributed spectrum. In other words, there is a huge middle ground to be explored. Both sex and gender represent a polarity, rather than a strict binary, where the majority of people are either male or female and where the majority identify as man (masculine) or woman (feminine). That's because there really is a strong biological basis for gender identity or expression, refined by cultural norms. The middle ground of intersex & transgender (or gender queer) is real, but it's sparsely populated because natural selection favors those who have the equipment to reproduce offspring. Our primate cousins don't have culturally defined gender roles, and they don't wear fedoras or wedding gowns, but they do exhibit some level of gendered behavior. This video makes no attempt at understanding the interplay between biology & culture. Comparing the male/female polarity, having a sparsely populated middle ground, with the continuous spectrum of evolutionary transitions, is a very bad analogy.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I have an argument. As somebody who is studying linguistics, if there are only two genders, than why do languages often include pronouns for more than two genders or none at all?

It could relate to how much you correlate with gender roles and expectations, but isn't this toxic as it implies the more you stick to male gender roles for example, the more of a man you are?

"In response to the rigidity of gender and the Richard Dawkins reference:   You're right , MASCULINITY  ( traits we consider masculine ) , and FEMININITY ( traits we consider feminine) , exist on a spectrum, however biological sex doesn't, there is only one thing that determines whether you are a girl or a boy, chromosomes.   The Richard Dawkins reference does not prove your point because he is referring to evolution and species, not biological sex. Sex doesn't change or morph through evolution, the species as a whole does, there will still be a clearly definable male and female , as is needed to reproduce and keep the species alive, no where along this timeline will a boy suddenly change into a girl, or vice versa.   While yes, some guys are more ' girly ' or feminine, this does no change the biological truth that he is a boy, even if he despises this fact, he is still by definition a boy.   If we are to disregard the definition of sex and say that someone is a girl simply because they feel like it ( emotion does not portray reality ) , or because they try to look or act like it ( appearance does not reflect reality ). Then we are openly disregarding logic in favor of what makes us feel better, or in favor of how we feel reality should be.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"how can you talk about chromosome and completely neglect to mention that being male is determined by the presence of the Y chromosome period even if you're XY and don't have the SRN gene active (just for the record that means they develop like a biological female but biologically speaking they are male). next they are anomalies because either the cells didn't divide correctly aka an extra chromosome is present or one is missing like Turner syndrome like XO. next certain chromosomal anomalies don't do anything XO and XXX still developed like normal biologically females. in  rare situation the X chromosome will have a mutation and gain the SRN gene thus the biological women develops a fully functioning male reproduction system.

Yes, there are arrangements other than XX and XY but these are genetic disorders that have as much to do with gender expression as Down Syndrome.  The point you're arguing against is that chromosomes are entirely responsible for determining your body plan, including all primary and secondary sexual characteristics, and you're not addressing that by pointing out genetic disorders. I wish my gender was a choice - I've always wanted to be a woman. But it's not, and pretending otherwise is just hiding from reality.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I feel dumber for watching this. This is a fantastic example of why the soft sciences are not respected by hard ones. The application of the scientific method is not respected at all. And all arguments presented dont even account for statistical measure here, something highly respected in science, especially biology. In most biological measures, you can accept the majority of populations of events as the norm and anything outside of this as abnormal, or a variable. So yes biology is fluid, be it has statistic majority for classification (which most people in this thread and Contra would know if they remembered this simple stuff from early high school). This whole video neglects statistics, just saying there is variance. No one denies the variance, but gender in this case is measured on majority which from when i last checked, was over 90% of populations (for all anomalies, including sexual preference).   If we applied this same kind of logic to say medical science, another fluid biology, people would be dying. We apply what we know in the majority of cases and research those that are different so they are protected from the statistical majority treatments. These are abnormal. And trying to deconstruct English, or common language to suit, really fucks up society, because if we decide language is that fluid, no one will know what anyone means because everyone will start to make up their own shit.

"If I may add to the conversation, I'd like to revisit the chair idea. Those philosophers you mention (and by 'philosophers,' I assume you mean Plato) have a theory about chairs, or more generally, the theory of forms. According to this theory, Plato says no chair is a true chair. Rather, all things we call 'chair,' all the things we recognize as chairs, are just imitations of the perfect chair, with varying degrees of 'chairness.' So a chair you sit at the dining table with might be 95% chair, thus earning the title 'chair.'  With that in mind, let's examine gender. In the form 'woman,' there are varying degrees of womanness. So, someone with xx chromosomes, but no other obviously womanly characteristics, they might be 20% female. Assuming their other characteristics are male sex organs and secondary sex characteristics, they'd be 80% male and therefore considered a man. Conversely, a trans woman with male sex organs, xy chromosomes, no functioning gonads, and female secondary sex characteristics may be considered 60% on the womanness scale, thus earning the title 'woman.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Sorry but you're fundamentally wrong.  The determining genetic marker for male and female is the Y chromosome.  So even if you look at the rare cases of genetic anomalies, XXY is still male because it has the Y.  As for the evolution of species, once again there are genetic determiners that separate species.  Even one from it's ancestor.  One trait is that of reproduction.  The evolved species can no longer produce off spring when mating with the previous one.  To use your own example, the rabbit can not have offspring with the chicks because the two are too far genetically removed from each other.  The notion of gender being a social construct is absolutely absurd.  Such people have clearly never heard of the term 'subculture'.  Examples of which are Jock, Punk, Emo, Goth, etc.  These are not genders but when people talk about the 'social construct of gender' and describe what it means to be a particular gender, it's obvious that these people are conflating gender with subculture.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"gender comes from the greek genus which can mean race,stock,kind,order and inparticular (male and female) PIE root of genus (ie the protolanguage that dates back to 3500bce) is gene which means give birth, beget.lets look at that so give birth is obviously the female roll in reproduction, beget- '(especially for a male parent) to procreat or generate male offspring'. i dont know about you but the word gender in its very origin as far back as we can date it seems to reffer to defining or grouping people based on reproductive characteristics not on how feminin or masculin they feel, seems like the word gender is based on biological reproductive roles not social construct if you are a feminin male your gender isn't technically female nore is your sex, you are just that a feminine male because the intended purpose of your genitals is the reproductive roll of a male. dont get the two confused sure masculinity and femininity are on a spectrum because masculinity is just (in general male traits behaviour and atributes and is not at all an absolute) same goes for femininity and and the odd female being an acception to the atrbutes you can in general deffine as characteristics typically atributed to the female sex. but as for gender looking at its very origin it becomes clear, its root is cut and dry it relates to the 2 biological sexes required for procreation and the particular one an individual falls in to based on well the fact that they are equipt to for the male roll in reproduction or the female roll in reproduction. now does this mean if you are unable to have kids you aren't a gender? no because a deffective spade is a spade none the less. as for intersex people they are a defect and dont really fit into the equasion of reproduction (which is after all the very point of sex and gender in the first place and without it the concept is well none existant) but ok lets say i give leniency and say ok there is room for a third gender for hermaphrodites which again isn't a gender not to be cruel just tecnically isn't how exactly is that an argument for a male who expresses more feminine trates then masculine trates a female? it doesn't because again thats irralivent to the persons biological reproductive roll and as we just assest thats the only thing ralavent when discussing what is male and what is female because thats the point of male and female to beggin with. this isn't to shit on anyone by the way if you are a male that wants to live out the life of a female because thats who you are then the best of luck to you or if you are a female that wants to live out the life that resembals being a male because you are more masculine then thats fine there are outlyers and not everyone fits in the general rule and i wish you all the best i really do...but that said if you are going to try change what words mean or there intended purpose to suit your feelings over the fact then i am going to call you out on it, and even if the deffinition has changed the reality the word depicts in origin is still a reality even if you ignore it, and ignoring somthing that fundamental about who and what you are is more often then not counter productive to yourself and wellbeing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Okay, so let's start off with basics.  Biological sex all comes down to which gamete you produce.  Nothing more.  Now there is a slight argument about individuals who genetically can't produce either gamete, but even these are NOT a new sex as they don't produce a gamete.  A best they are a non-sex, but we don't do that in biology, you just get tossed into the nearest category because it is impractical to create a new one and unnecessary.  Which leads us to the next point, sex is sometimes used loosely on those secondary (emphasis on secondary) sex characteristics to define a category.  Think the Olympics.  But here the issue is entirely practical.  Now only are a good number of the intersex individual very closely aligned with one of the existing male/female categories to the point of it being useless to distinguish them (and often quite insulting to those individuals btw), but the few that aren't are predominantly suffering from serious health issues to the point they can't even compete practically, and we're already starting with a number generally sub 1% of the population area.  So with those extra issues in play, there is no practical purpose is defining a 3rd or 4th pseudo sex category as there is simply too few people to take advantage of it.  Now, the second situation could at least in theory want to us definite a new psuedo sex under certain circumstances, but I've yet to encounter ANY practical situation that exists for such.

"Problem is with your chromosomes argument is that somebody with XYY is still male. They still grow up male, can produce sperm and father children. They often have no idea that they are different from XY. Why classify them as intersex? They are not a new sex, they are not a third sex. They are still quintessentially male. Thats why we still rely on the ever reliable presence of a Y chromosome. That will always hold true.  Except in the case of AIS, where the Y chromosome isn't activated or doesn't respond properly so they never get the hormones needed to become male. They develop as a female. These people are genetically male but pragmatically female. They produce ovaries and all female characteristics, they can give birth, and many don't know they have the condition. Technically they are male but not practically. Thing is though, this occurs in less than 1 in 20,000 births, so only a couple of thousand people in the entire world have this. But they live their lives as female without ever needing intersex labels or being transgender. So we rightfully call them an outlier, and not some new rule where chromosomes don't matter.   We can in that scenario actually identify what went wrong and how it went wrong. Its a birth defect or genetic defect. Thats not to say the individual is less of a person but something abnormal happened during their development in the womb. But the human body still adjusts trying to fit to the male/female dichotomy. Why do you think somebody born X still is fundamentally female? Sure, they can't reproduce and they have physical deformities, but their body and their mothers body still used what DNA it had to try and create a female. There is therefore no need to define them as a new sex.  When it comes to biological sex, its all to do with reproduction. You need two individuals to reproduce, and it so happens in most that each serves a different role, one brings eggs, the other brings sperm. Eggs cannot fertilize eggs, and sperm cannot with sperm either. So anybody who brings sperm, or attempts to bring sperm (whether or not that sperm is fertile or can be produced at all by the body is irrelevant) because they have the machinery built for it, they are all part of the same group. If they cannot breed with each other, why call them different sexes? Especially if they cannot breed at all. But if they can breed with somebody who has eggs, does it matter how different ones eggs might be from anothers?  Consider this thought experiment. I state we have two biological sexes, for simplicity - 1 and 2. 1 can't breed with 1, but 1 can breed with 2. You propose there are sexes 1 through 10. But sexes 1-4 cannot breed with another 1-4. Sexes 5-9 cannot breed with another 5-9. But any of sexes 1-4 can breed with any 5-9. And 10 (or lets say 10 and beyond) cannot breed with anybody. Why are we classifying them so differently when fundamentally 1-4 are just one group? Its like saying a Holden is a different type of vehicle from a Honda. Sure, they have cosmetic differences, and one might have a different engine than the other. But both are still cars, and not trucks. So when talking about vehicle-ness, they are still the same category, they may differ within that group but they are still part of the same group.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Well, whether we can create a working definition of 'biological sex' doesn't seem to discredit the idea that sexual reproduction in humans only has two functional roles. Which is what 'Biological Sex' it is describing. There are people who are inter-sexed or who have chromosomal disorders, but I don't know of any cases where a human has been a functional hermaphrodite or have had an alternative method of reproduction that isn't based on semen inseminate an egg. Just because those people exist doesn't mean they fill a sexually reproduction role, which is what biological sex is describing. Its like saying that humans are bipedal because some people are born without legs or a third malformed leg, a birth defect is a defect and doesn't invalidate the idea that humans are a bipedal species on any meaningful level. I'd be perfectly willing in a social situation to say that someone who is transgenders, or a person with chromosomes of the XXY or XYY or X or Y or XYZLMNOP variety is a male, female or whatever else they want to identity as.

Also in you Genderqueer video you said about people indentifying as both ends of the spectrum and as neither(nothing at all on the spectrum, i pressume). Soo... how can you be both? You  a duck AND a rabbit? And i don't mean a middle of the spectrum, i mean BOTH ends of it. Aren't you one one creature and choose only one place in this spectrum? If not then analogy is actually misleading. Or how can you be not on the spectrum at all? That genders seems to me as trying to be original and outgender outqueer your friends to be more unique.

"Intersex people are not what is being talked about when talking about sex in this argument 90% of the time though. What's being talked about is people who are phenotypically male or female who do not have Swyer Syndrome  (Swyer syndrome is specifically when a Y chromosome lacks the part that turns someone male because of a copying mishap that put it on the X chromosome instead). If the whole 'sex is a spectrum' thing was only referring to people with chromosomal abnormalities, then I don't think we would have any real debate on this (you might have some argument about a birth defect not being a sex or something I guess).  Maybe I am just misunderstanding what people say, but whenever it is brought up, I definitely get the impression that there is a claim for much more than just people with chromosomal abnormalities being something other than pure male or female sexed.  Later you talk about using different definitions for different contexts. Perhaps the problem is that when people say sex is binary (or almost entirely binary with a  few intersex people perhaps), they are referring to 'without surgery,' or 'what their body was before alterations'?  When I use the term 'biological sex' it is a term for prior to surgery or other alterations.  If biological sex is not the term you wish to use, then what is the term for 'at birth penis havers' and 'at birth vagina havers'? I think male and female do fine in this context.  *The above has no bearing on my opinions on transgenderism or people who undergo surgery in any way, I am only arguing the point on the term sex*","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I don't know how anybody can be conscious of all the comments under their videos but here goes...   I was watching your post Blair White debate analysis interview on the youtube Destiny channel. Towards the end consciousness and free will came up. I am going to qualify what I say by admitting I am still learning about physics (for example I struggle to get my head around the bit 5 minutes and 30 seconds into PBS's 'The Higgs Mechanism Explained' - well done if you can understand it). My view on consciousness (if I am understanding physics correctly) wasn't even possible until the 20th century. I think modern understanding has made consciousness more special than it was using the old Newtonian physics (that you get taught as a teenager). For me the fact (again I don't fully understand physics) that Einstein's General Theory of relativity and Quantum Mechanics are incompatible at scales just larger than the atom - the scale at which infra red phenomena occurs (movement of atoms and molecules) - creates a great unknown regarding what consciousness actually consists of and whether consciousness is even possible at larger or smaller scales...     So when people take conversations about consciousness away from the physical scale at which consciousness exists (i.e. the scale of sound and language, at speeds and frequencies we associate with consciousness, and where the two modern pillars of Physics overlap and disagree) by the terms I have defined then I think that is doing disservice to the subject of consciousness, and moreover can no longer be defined as a conscious conversation. It is well known that we have levels of consciousness while we are awake ranging from trance to the conscious state of meditation - the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is of interest here as it is less active when in trance and dealing with material objects, but more active when in R.E.M. sleep and interacting with people or while in meditation. It all comes back to love essentially.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"9:46 'Gender is a performance, a series of imitative behaviours.'  First off, sorry for this wall. Second, a nitpick (or a pretty big correction, depending on how significant you think etymology is here). There is this wide (misrepresented) notion that Butler opines that gender is a 'performance', but she makes a distinction between 'performance' and 'performativity' that many people seem to miss (a very common misconception born from academia, much like how people think Marxism has anything to do with giving everyone equal stuff). Basically, as I understood it, she says that to say gender is a 'performance' would mean that you are 'acting', that it is an egoistical (rational/logical) decision to 'do your gender', and so, everyone would be able to change their gender as their mood comes and goes (dysphoria wouldn't be a thing under this definition). Butler, instead says that gender is 'performative', and by this, I understand she means that when a group sees among themselves a collection of behavior that it can, without the involvement of the ego, categorize under a single name, it will do so, and in this case it is named 'gender'. Under this definition, gender is not an egoistic construct, but it is created (through repetition) by the transgressive properties of our superego. All a bit weird sounding, sure, and heavy on psychoanalysis (also, in Gender Trouble, the two words seem to slide into each other, and it took me a while to understand her perspective, too), but basically, I think the distinction is that the former def has to with 'putting on a face for others that you can shed at any time', while the latter is 'being observed as someone who doesn't become 'someone' until that face is part of their identity', hence the concept of 'doing your gender wrong'. Performance presupposes a preexisting subject, while performativity contests the very notion of the subject. There is a Big Think video on YT where Butler explains the distinction. Also, I understand that this is just kind of a beginner video, but I just wanted to complicate the discussion because it is an important one. Hope you're well!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Already did an effort post before that got ignored so this feels like a damn waste, but whatever.  You say that the XX XY categories and generic penis=man vagina=woman don't work because there are less than 1% of people that do not fall correctly into these categories. Okay so that means that we have to redefine the definition because some few people who have something fucked up about them do not fit into them? Even if gross mass majority of normal people fall into their categories perfectly and even with their sexuality.  You make a point that gender is a social structure in a way like money because how people interact with money is very real ect, and gravity is different because its meaning to everything is not determined by humans. Which is kinda true, but you are ignoring the fact that gender as structure is a thing in animals, even if these structures are the opposite of the normal human ones. Some animal females are stronger so they take the dominant position, or there are animals that can even change their gender. But the fact that gender exists and gender created dominance hierarchies exist means, that gender is practically universal in animals. You can't say that gender is social construct done by humans when its done by millions other species as well.  Also its kinda funny you use picture King Louis XIV wearing what today we consider girly clothes while carrying a sword. Does it not contradict your point?

"I caught your debate with Blair,  and I want to make a very simple point,  that I hope doesn't go over your head as you try to make everything so complicated.... But,  Blair is right,  A man cannot turn into a woman, and a woman cannot turn into a man.  The fact that there is a category called 'Trans'  proves it.   There would be no need for Trans-rights, or Trans anything if a transition would actually be possible,  because then you would simply be man or woman.  The existence of 'Trans' as a classification proves that transition is impossible and your just acting as the opposite sex.  Again,  If you could actually transition,  you would simply be male or female.  Do you see how simple that is ?  Its self defeating.    Also, I'm really curious,  whatever happened to people just being themselves, and embracing and loving themselves,  and now people are obsessed with labels and fitting into boxes and conformity.  I'm rather baffled that I'm watching a debate on transgender conformity, and I don't know if that's what you even realize you are arguing for, stricter labeling, stereotyping, and conformity.  Also, here is another pointer on self defeating talking points,  I would stay away from mentioning science when your talking about gender, which is claimed to be a social construct.  social constructs are unscientific by their very nature.  If it was scientific,  it would not be a social construct.  You cannot have it both ways.....  wow, now I just got to the part where blair is having to explain to you what a vagina is, and what a wound is,  and your claiming because you can stick things in a wound that it's a vagina.  So, If someone fucks my ear, can that be a vagina too ?   From the bottom of my heart kid,  Do what makes you happy,  and that's all the reasoning you need.

"I think I'm still unimpressed with the proposals to blur the lines of biological sex. This is a binary that transcends the human species & as far as I'm aware, applies to just about every animal (I think you have a few hermaphrodites, mostly plants, but that just ends up being the exception that proves the rule given that they are decidedly BOTH male and female and not a nebulous halfway inbetween).  You can expose a male fetus to a whole lotta hormones or chemicals & make him grow into all kinds of crazy shapes. It doesn't make him any less male (though it may cripple some masculine part of him, render him infertile, or make him appear more feminine). He's no closer to being female than cutting off your dick as a full grown adult would, or a cancerous growth that resembles tree bark makes you somewhere on the spectrum between plant and animal. He's just twisted into a similar shape. Stray mutations generally aren't considered when deciding what constitutes the characteristics of a group of organisms, even when they're fairly common.  And extra/missing chromosomes is generally the result of a misfire or cell damage in cell division. That's not exactly a variation on a sex as much as it is a birth defect. It's basically down's syndrome for your genitals. Sure, mutations could lead to a new gender (from the look of the Y chromosome, that's probably how we got males), but it appears to have happened ONCE since we split from a common ancestor with mushrooms (google fungus genders).  Personally I'd prefer to focus on stripping away the social & behavioral expectations of men & women. Let male and female be the rigid chromosome binary, but don't necessarily let that dictate how you live your life (beyond the obvious physical limitations). I worry that this philosophy of biological sex as a spectrum is deliberately erasing terminology that doesn't fit chromosomal diseases in what can be considered sex so that there's room to indulge a delusion with one's very own 'god of the gaps'. Not so much worried for society, more for the individual that doesn't seem capable of accepting their state of physical being.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"If their best argument for more than two genders is that this isn't a new thing and it's been around for thousands of years that's absolutely bullshit. God only knows how long people thought the earth was flat, and that bathing made you sick. There are only two genitals, a penis, and a vagina. Only two genders male and female respectively. You and everyone else on this planet have every right to dress and act however they want, but don't you dare tell me to go against what is scientifically and biologically concrete. If you're a male that wants to transform into a female, there is nothing wrong with you and you have every right to do so, but gender has absolutely nothing to do with sexual preference and people change their minds on that all the time. You can't bounce back and forth between male and female on a whim. If you have a penis you're a man, and a vagina you're a girl. If you undergo sex changing surgery and fully transform your body and put in the time effort then I understand wanting people to address you as your preferred gender. But being a whiney, attention seeking brat because you want to be different is an insult to all trans people who are really trying to make a change. You complain that it's so hard to be you, that you're oppressed and tormented by society, look at the real problems on this earth; murder, rape, starvation, natural disasters, kidnappings, war, genocide. You really think wanting to be a boy one second, a girl another, or neither is a real issue? The world doesn't revolve around your indecisiveness, and I am strongly opposed to anyone who throws science out the door and claims it's a social construct. Yes girls like dolls and boys like trucks is a social construct, but gender is not. You are not assigned your gender, and it is not an act of violence. There are people who truly suffer on this planet beyond what any of you can ever comprehend and your need to be sexually identified as a stapler is a fucking joke and I will not, WILL not cater to it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Describing a trans woman as a trans woman, does not make that person less, it is just an accurate description. If someone is intersex, then they are intersex.

Moreover, all of one animal doesn't turn into all of another. The lineage continued and simply branched off, but that base is still there.

"I can certainly appreciate your points about the tricky nature of language; the argument about the way we categorize chairs reminds me of a lecture by Steven Pinker, and I've never quite managed to summarize his points as concisely as you have here. I can even agree that the way we classify biological sex is generally reductive, and that most of us tend to make that classification at first glance by assessing a combination of physical traits. We get really, really hung up on these categories, too. I've seen men who were really incisive about one topic wax on at length because they felt conflicted about their attraction to a trans-woman, convinced that because we can't change our sex, and because 'gay' is this rock-solid classification used to describe people attracted to the same sex, that any expression of gender is irrelevant, and they must be gay. It's certainly not that simple.  We just have to disagree at 5:24, though. I think biological sex is a meaningful classification despite our tendency to assess what are essentially phenotypical characteristics and classify based on some measure of inductive reasoning, because biological sex is a tool that we use to make distinctions between organisms with different reproductive functions. It seems pretty clear that people are overwhelmingly male or female, and have characteristics that are largely consistent with these classifications. That a very small fraction of the population resists easy classification isn't persuasive evidence to suggest that any kind of spectrum exists, because a spectrum entails equal representation at all points. We don't see that here. We see a few aberrations, many of whom are mostly male or mostly female with minor variations.  Meanwhile, many intersex people can be classified using a binary, and their gender identity reflects this. A woman with AIS may have internal testicles and XY sex chromosomes, but we classify her as a woman because her physical traits are largely consistent with other women. Given that most women with AIS would appear to identify as women, it's not necessary to reinvent the wheel and demand that we classify these people as some third or fourth or seventh sex, nor as something in between male and female. It would be one thing if they played a different role in sexual reproduction, but they don't, so why would we need to invent a new sex to describe them?

"*a e s t h e t i c ! ! !* (somewhat lengthy message incoming):  Goodness, gracious, pink-wigged Jesus, you are awesome. Like, 'cool, cooler, coolest' awesome. I've determined that I would be remiss in not sharing the importance of your vids. For example, it took only two of them (this, and the one about being genderqueer) to completely upend my misconceptions about gender. And mind you, those videos are, as of yet, the _only_ ones I've watched.  See, I generally hover on the line between 'liberal dilettante' and 'hard science bro'. With regards to gender identity, this meant that while I accepted that people have different life experiences and identities and should obviously be allowed to make their own decisions regarding them, I was skeptical of the objective grounding for nonbinary. I agreed that gender is a social construct, but that understanding didn't extend to what I saw as the construction of novel and frivolous identities. This resulted in me being less-than-sympathetic about some of the issues facing those who so identified.  However, this and the genderqueer video have vastly expanded my views. They characterized and contextualized nonbinary gender identities in an entertaining and aesthetically-pleasing manner, and I now feel all sorts of enlightened and ready to do some research and introspection of my own. So thanks! If I were to praise your work by means of comparison, I would say that it's like that of 'Kurzegesagt -- In a Nutshell', 'cept with more synthwave and infinitely more dabs.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'Gender' = sex roles and sex role stereotypes One of the biggest mistakes feminists made in the late 1970s was using the term 'gender' to replace the older terms. It opened the door for the word 'gender' to be deliberately conflated with sex. To use the older and more accurate terms makes it far easier to inform the public of the ludicrousness of transgenderism and exposes the vast majority of the trans as the fetishists and kinksters they truly are. Nobody can 'identify' as a sex role. It is a performance, an act, a group of behaviors assigned to each sex to make them 'complementary' to each other ('masculinity' and 'femininity'),  and it is not rooted in biology.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Interesting video. We don't have a word for 'something that is slightly a rabbit' or 'something that is mostly a rabbit' for a simple reason - words describe things that people know about, and when people started speaking languages, they had no idea about evolution, all they could see were rabbits. There is no point in having common words for these, because they don't exist anymore and only scientists deal with them (and when they existed, rabbits didn't). The problem with defining 'chair' is that meaning changes with time. People make an object for sitting that has a certain shape and they call it 'chair'. Then someone else makes another object for sitting that has a slightly different shape and they call it 'chair', because it's used for sitting. After some time people will know a pattern of a shape of the chair (or multiple shapes) that they have seen and start calling similar objects a chair, too. As of the problem of gender, I think that the solution is quite simple. We can say there are two genders - male and female - and then there are rare exceptions. Most people have all or almost all characteristics of either male or female gender, including biological sex. I don't know whether gender could be called a social construct, because it's more or less based on biology. There are clearly psychological and physiological differences between men and women - men are generally stronger and women are more emphatic and they give birth to children => men are more suited for manual work and women for other things like taking care of children => they wear different clothes, woman used to (and to some extent still do) cook, do housework etc. more than men (because it is/used to be more efficent - men manually work => women do other things). Nowadays manual work becomes less important -> the difference between what men and women do is decreasing => a lot of things that I mentioned is becoming more or less irrelevant => the past becomes the sole reason for some (but not all) differences between the genders.  Gender is clearly not a psychological state - its meaning is derived from biological sex. Gender dysphoria is a rare disorder where the gender is for no logical reason the opposite.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Contrapoints appeal to Dawkins discussing the nature of evolution and the consequential difficulties as related to the classification of animals into species as an argument for a 'gender' spectrum is an absurd false equivalency in multiple ways. >_<  Whereas the fact that the evolutionary 'spectrum' exists in a single dimension progressing in a single direction across time going from proto or psuedo-rabbit to modern rabbit the 'gender' spectrum (assuming such a thing exists) while similarly one dimensional, progresses in two directions and is naturally divisible as a binary.  You have more feminine, less feminine, neutral (possibly androgeny), less masculine, more masculine.  or  Female/Feminine | Male/Masculine as the general categorization of anything applicable to 'gender' as a descriptive (adjective, not noun) concept.  Gender is binary in this nature because sex IS NECESSARILY binary, due to the fact that procreative potential, or to be more precise, assumed/presupposed procreative potential IS binary. Either you have a past/present/future procreative (cap)ability or you do not. This is a metaphysical attribute intrinsic to all animals. Human beings tie various cultural values, norms, and social conventions often represented by specific behavioral and visual aesthetics to procreation because humans recognize the existence of sexual reproduction as well as other numerous factors that compose the identifiable categories relevant to classifying the individual.  Thus 'transgender' is a naturally emergent category and class of people who appropriate the stereotypical presentation of the biological sex they are not and sometimes adopt the normative associated stereotypical behavioral mannerisms of their appropriated biological sex, relative to their culture, with the intent of being perceived by others as an individual who has (or does not have) intrinsic procreative potential.  All this queer theory and genderbread man shit is complete nonsense. Trannys are either fetishists, delusional, or mentally ill. Those are the people which transgenderism encompasses. Period. I don't know which one Contrapoints is, probably a fetishist based on his obnoxious anime-esque pink wig presentation or a delusive based on his defense of queer theory and slander of gender critical radical feminists as 'TERFS.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This video was really confusing; and not just because of the weird shit with the watermelon and beakers (which was awesome BTW).  You appear to assert that there is no difference between biological sex and gender in the first half of your video; and then in the second half you act like there is a difference even though you never specified one.    The gender of a trans woman is female and the sex of a trans woman is male.  That is what makes them trans.  Otherwise, the word 'trans' is unnecessary and meaningless.  Sex is rigidly defined in the science of biology-- and it is done this way because it is analytically useful.  The existence of anomalous intersex individuals does not change the fact that sexually reproducing life is largely organized into a binary biological specialization.  Gender, on the other hand, is a complex psychological and sociological construct dealing with how an individual is internally driven to represent their biological sex-- one that is generally only applied to human beings and their behaviors.  No one asks what gender a cockroach or a spider is, at least not in that sense.  You asserted that gender is a social construct without addressing the elephant in the room... and I have to say, I'm really tired of this elephant being ignored because it's been left filling up the room of academic gender studies with dung for a long time now.  Meet elephant:  Most trans people are socialized their entire lives as the opposite gender from the one they eventually assume... and they reject it, often at great trauma and risk to themselves.  Similarly, boys who have had badly botched circumcisions have been raised as girls, and that has backfired with them returning to their biological sex without even knowing what their biological sex was.  That only makes sense if there is a hard biological basis-- that is, some aspect of their consciousness-- behind it; at least in part.  Obviously that doesn't mean that all of it is biologically driven, as is evident in the existence of widely different gender-based cultural norms such as crocodile-skin man, but it does imply that there is something extra.  The gendered cultural norms, however bizarre, are an expression of something.  Wouldn't you agree?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I appreciate the honesty and humor in this video, especially the jab at philosophers. This is not a scientific in the least however. There's too much to address with a single comment, so I'll be brief. First of all, sex is purely binary. Sex is a phenotype. It is based on 2 mating types being anisogamous. Chromosomes are irrelevant, they are merely a way to code the genotype to phenotype map (in some reptiles, sex is mainly determined by temperature!). Your particular anatomical features are irrelevant, they're just a way to produce the gametes that actually define your sex. Secondary sexual characteristics are irrelevant, not all anisogamous sexually reproducing species are sexually dimorphic (A. vittata, for example). Sex exists in plants, and in all of Animalia, and in Mycota as well. In some plants, the single organism can have both sexes as the same time! (We call them true hermaphrodites). Some organisms, such as the clown fish, can only express one sex, but can switch its sex within its lifetime! Human beings are sadly not one of these organisms. You use intersex people as your trump card. These individuals commonly suffer from aneuploidies (extra or missing chromosomes) in their 23rd slot of the karyotype. Same as Down's Syndrome patients have an extra chromosome 21. It is not normal. It is a medical disorder and these individuals deserve to receive are empathy and understanding. That being said, however, these individuals usually fall into one sex or the other, as they still produce sperm or eggs. Sometimes they may not be able to produce neither, in which case these people have no sex. If you find this idea confusing, simply ask yourself: 'what is the eye color of someone that has no eyes?'. The XY female is another phenomenon used to confuse. In these individuals, the SRY gene of their Y chromosome has suffered a LOF (loss of function) mutation, rendering it non functional. In humans, the 'default' of the development program is to create a female, male development must be 'turned on'. At the risk of oversimplifying this, it is the SRY gene that starts the male development program. No SRY, No male. You do the math.   As to what gender is, you never define it rigorously, only say it is a social construct. You add that it is about psychology. Gender started to be distinguished from sex in a non linguistic context by John Money, who believed the same social constructionist ideals as you do. His hypotheses (which he developed through gross scientific misconduct, may I add) have been falsified. Sexual dimorphism extends to behavior, through sexual dimorphism of the brain. Sex explains what we see, making 'gender' totally irrelevant. You conflate 'gender', which is fundamentally categorical, with gender (or really sex) roles, expectations and societal trends. I agree that many of these ARE social constructs. Nowhere in our genes does it say boys=blue, girls=pink. But these are expectations and associations, not the categories themselves. And yes, sex and biology predict who's the primary caretaker, it's called Bateman's principle, which in spite of the flaws of the original study, it's been shown to hold.  You don't address what mating types are, Fisher's Principle, or any population biology which is the field that uncovers the natural laws that govern living populations, including us. I don't mean to be mean or disrespectful with this, but the science is severely lacking.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Intersex people don't ruin the idea of bi-modal sex and that's not to do with forcing reality to fit your preconceived notions.   For example, we might say there are a two classes of animals. Bipeds, and non-bipeds. Humans are bipeds. The fact not all humans have two legs doesn't mean we're 'forcing reality to fit preconceived notions'. It works because humans almost always walk on two legs.   The same is true for sex. As a species we come in two different sexes. Some people don't but that no more ruins the bi-modal nature of sex than one legged people ruin the characterization of bipedal.     Here's my view on these concepts, tell me where I'm being inconsistent or failing to provide sensible frameworks for the social sciences to explain things;  1) Sex exists and is bi-modal.   2) Masculinity and femininity exist and refer to societal constructs. This is lipstick, child-raising and skin scarring. They DO change depending on society because duh, they're constructed by society. Who you are inside doesn't make sense in terms of man/woman any more than it makes sense in terms of bi-ped/mono-ped.(of however many legs you have).   3) Gender doesn't exist. If it does it refers to ones preference to be a given sex. It's a neat shorthand but that's about it   It might seem like all I'm doing is changing gender to masculine/feminine and that might be true, but doing this seems to fix all the confusion generated by the current cluster-fuck of definitions that attempt to explain gender at present. I don't see why people insist on the frankly contradictory definitions that seem to exist for no other reason but increase the special snowflakedness level ones 'identity'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"No mention of the SRY-gene? Pft.  Gender identity is informed by biology. The fact that one can consider gender identity some kind of spectrum, doesn't mean that gender isn't in fact binary. It is informed by the role and purpose of gametes. The gender spectrum doesn't even make sense if there isn't a male and a female endpoint to the spectrum, seeing as we're not a Hermaphroditic species. There are roles of reproduction in our species.  The fact that we can now afford to shed those roles when it comes to daily life is neither here nor there.  But one of the biggest problems I see when it comes to the concept of gender, given that it's used as a term referring to social negotiation, is one of pragmatism. I have a hard enough time remembering peoples names, the reason that pronouns are used in languages is to be able to grab the attention to and negotiate with people you don't know in your surroundings. It's just not practical to ask people for their pronouns before you engage with them.   The problem creeps in here when people expect some sort of social or legal consequence for misgendering people. Even the most well-meaning and polite person will eventually slip up and accidentally misgender somebody, so I don't have any patience for treating it as deserving these consequences. But I also don't really see the social consequences when it comes to being deserving of somebody respecting your pronouns, even when you're being misgendered through intent. If you've resigned yourself and you're in agreement that gender is considered part of an active social negotiation, somebody has every right to negotiate with you on their own terms. You have no right to their respect.  Also, I do have a problem with the dichotomy that you seem to be resigning yourself to regarding gender identity and gender expression, you perfectly encapsulated it when asking *'Who Am I?'* and referencing your previous video.   From an outsider perspective, it feels to me like people who identify as something other than man/woman _(non-binary, genderqueer, agender, what-have-you)_, have simply resigned themselves to identify as that because they feel like they can't be bothered negotiating their gender expression and that this somehow helps to reorient and organize themselves in their society given this conundrum. This seems like a cop out that seeks to avoid rather than address the problem head on to me.  Why is it so shameful to simply identify as a man/woman that expresses their gender in a non-conforming way? And no, I don't consider trans people or intersex conditions to be a third (or higher) gender.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

This is brought up a lot in these types of arguments, but intersex is not the smoking gun, if anything it proves that in nature there are pretty clear lines, and that those lines are only blurred maybe 1.7% of the time (if we're being generous here). If the distinction of chromosomes and physical characteristics were ill-defined (i.e. intersex) in EVERY human (or the majority) I would agree that intersex is a valid point to disproving biological gender.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I feel like what I commented in the other video still applies here. The entire concept of 'feeling like a woman' is empty and non definable unless you are referring to stereotypes (wearing a dress makes me feeling like a woman) or biological (menstrual cramps make me feel like a woman).  ALso, why did you call science masculine? If a woman is interested in science, does that make her masculine? Or is she just a woman who likes science? It's sexist to imply women are only interested in social sciences.  With the research I've done, every person who has been recorded as intersex with a combination of female and male organs, has had either a penis and a non functioning vagina, or had a vagina and a non functioning penis. As far as I'm aware there has been no recorded instance of anyone having both functioning organs.The pressense of one prevents the other from functioning. In many cases, neither the vagina or penis function. This is why I consider it a deformity. This is not an insult. People can be born without arms or legs. That's not a new type of human, that's just a deformed human. Again, not an insult. Amputees can still live great prosperus lives.  Yes, sex is a spectrum. But that statement is misleading as it includes deformites that cause infertility. And none of that justifies a transperson's gender.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Erm, sorry, but 'rabbit' _does_ have a specific definition laid out by biologists, just as all well-documented species do. In that rather inane thought experiment you gave from Richard Dawkins (which I am sad to say, because I admire the man on many fronts), there would actually be a point where there are rabbits on one side of the line and non-rabbits on the other, because the ones on that side would not fulfill all the criteria contained in the current definition of the word 'rabbit'. The reason that thought experiment doesn't work here at all is because it takes a case where you string out the entire evolution of a species, which spans a _large amount of time_, but apply the _current_, i.e. single point in time, common usage of a single word to _everything_ on that string.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Jesus, production has gone up, but so has the speciousness of your arguments. How can you show a list of human chromosome abnormalities and say that this proves gender isn't binary. Would you say being born armless is not a defect? You can be born with an abnormality and it does not imply we must redefine all mammals. Just because you are born does not make everything about you totally normal.  You also say that science cannot truly define what gender is because what humans mean by words might be very complex. Science is not dependent on what humans mean when they say a word. People use the term weight, when they mean mass, it does not mean that mass and weight are the same in the eyes of science. Water is defined by science despite people using it to describe all sorts of liquids.   Social sciences is not considered at the same level of biology because it lacks rigor, around 80% of social sciences studies cannot be reproduced.   Your ego is getting the best of you and you seem to lack the ability to check your emotions to understand other people's arguments.

"Hi Contra, I appreciate the video but I have just a few questions:  1) Is it really useful to under sex as under a cluster-concept/family-resemblance model? Surely it's still easier to understand male and female as relating to chromosomes and regard intersex persons as just that I.e. neither male nor female)  2) Just with regards to what you said about their being as many masculinities and femininities as there are cultures. How can we understand what is a 'masculinity' without having some underlying/unifying feature within them. It seems to me that there must be some cross-cultural gender ideals for us to be able to identify them as such  3) Isn't applying different understandings of gender in different contexts intellectually dishonest? I'd imagine there must be something which drives the need to apply these different models and this higher-order value ought to be the focus of the decisions instead (if that is the case)  4) Not really a question but rather a criticism of your readiness to halt further investigation/your pessimism about the limits of philosophy.

"I was hoping you would address the argument that being intersex doesn't count as an exception to the sex binary because intersex characteristics are 'abnormalities,' 'deformities,' or 'pathology diagnoses.' This argument seems to be a non sequitur to me. It boils down to 'they're rare, so they don't warrant a distinct sexual category.' Rarity, of course, doesn't necessarily determine the validity or utility of a category.  Folks who use this also seem to think that intersex people are examples of when something 'goes wrong' with nature. In other words, they're saying that examples that contradict the binary sexual description of nature don't mean that our description is wrong, rather these are examples of nature being wrong for failing to match our description of it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I believe that if we are using different 'operational definitions' for gender dependent on context, what that really means is that we have different but related concepts of gender, and these concepts are relevant in different circumstances. In fact, the labels on the genderbread person can be seen as an attempt to separate and precisify those concepts. When we are discussing abortion rights, what matters is your genital anatomy, hence we talk of biological sex (ignoring the features which aren't relevant). When we talk about gender roles and stereotypes in a culture, what matters is the way you look and appear to others, so gender expression or performativity is relevant. When we are deciding what pronouns to use for someone, what matters is what gender they psychologically identify as (if we are nice), so gender identity is relevant. So gender really is a cluster of connected but separate and to some extent precise concepts, which, when separated, we can in fact make a good attempt at defining. The big problem, which has not been satisfactorily solved, is what exactly grounds gender identity. We can say that your gender identity is what gender you identify as psychologically, or internally. But there are many unanswered questions. Where does gender identity come from? Can it be right or wrong? What does it mean to say 'I identify as a man', other than 'I psychologically identify as a man'? More troublingly, it's not clear what sort of answer we need for these questions. Do we need a scientist to tell us where gender identity is located in the brain, and its chemical and social causes? Or do we need a philosopher to explain what it means to feel like you have a particular identity phenomenologically? Or perhaps a philosopher should reinterpret identification with a gender as some type of preference, for instance a preference about your body, or how you would like others to treat you. Or maybe it comes down to feelings about what societal norms 'apply' to you, but not necessarily which norms you think are right or wrong. In discussing the grounding of gender identity, it is important to not fall into positions which imply either that women ought to stay in the kitchen, or men ought or cannot wear dresses, whilst also allowing trans people's gender to have some meaningful basis. I have not seen any convincing argument for a particular position on gender identity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think you oversimplified what denotes someone's sex. In addition to gonads, genitalia, hormones and chromosomes, there's also things like skeletal structure and brain chemistry. And a trans person can't change their genitalia, they can only change the aesthetic of it through cosmetic surgery . And Intersex conditions are usually anomalous deformities of the gonads or chromosomal structure; They don't encompass the wide array of factors. There aren't more than two biological sexes because there's a biological imperative behind sexual dimorphism. I feel like your explanation is more an attempt to fit a palatable political ideology rather than explaining the actual science.  And this isn't me trying to insult trans people.

"OK, so I want to pose a difficulty I'm having with all of this gender stuff.  I have been convinced that gender is a social construct and that biological sex is a different thing.  I have also been convinced that there is definitely a spectrum of genders. Your spectrum point (vs binary) was very good, and I think that can be applied to every single debate we have.  BUT, here's my slight contention, would love to hear your thoughts on it.   IF people went to the doctor, came home, and said, 'I have xy chromosomes but I have breasts, therefore I am a _______' fill in the blank. I would be OK with this type of scenario. You have a medically testable diagnoses, and here's what 'you are'. When people bring up the fact that all these different chromosome combinations exist, that that is supposed to be the standard or something.  But, that's not what I see happening, there's a gap in logic. I feel like people are taking the fact that all of these different combinations exist (lets not forget that they're quite rare, as well), and then taking a logical leap and simply deciding what they're going to identify as. There is no standard, at all. Maybe one isn't possible, I'm not sure. We're mixing biology with psychology. All I hear from transgender people is, 'I have always felt like a girl, so I am one', which I don't really have a problem with, but it would be nice if it could be tied to something testable, instead of just what someone feels. Totally happy to be wrong about any of the above, but that's how it appears to me.  Hope that made sense.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Does Bruno mars is gay? Do 'I' mean anything? Are these drugs safe? Why do people hate porn? I love porn? Is that wrong of me? Why are we obsessed with giant mutant ostige eggs at easter time? Why do you look good in lilac? Is that even lilac? Do colours lie? Was that one dress secretly made by magicians to trick us into thinking colours can change? Is 4chan right about the reptilian takeover? Does Trump like carrots? I actually really like pepsi and hate coke does that make me a bad person?

Isn't the socially liberal stance of personal freedom over social responsibility, (communicated ironically and self-parodically here, but ultimately in earnest), inherently unsustainable in the long term?  If our definition of gender serves an operational purpose and differs depending on the context, aren't we, as selfish beings who no longer abide by static morality, going to adopt whichever suits our selfish purposes and not the purposes of society?

"A lot of people don't seem to understand how messy biology can be.   Gender is like an inverse parabola with the majority of the population at the poles, male and female. But there are those who are not, they are in-between in some fashion, Usually they are close enough to count as one of the poles. However there will be an amount who don't conform. Basic biological principles, any given population doesn't have consistent gene or gene expression across it. There's diversity within every group and you can naturally assume gender expression is part of that diversity. There's nothing special about gender that makes it set it stone, your genes don't care. It's a basic part of life and biology.   Gender is not a social construct, if it were gender dysphoria would not be a thing. That's the one thing that really irks me about 'allies' when they speak of transgender issues. They implicitly dismiss the entirety of transsexual points of view. I think you mean gender presentation is a social construct. Gender identity, by necessity, must have some sort of biological trigger (genetic, environmental, neurological, etc). Gender presentation does not, it cannot. As you said, different cultures define gender roles and their expressions vastly different.   As an aside, XXY trans women exist, I am likely one(karyotyping is too fucking expensive). Come at me bro, I'm collecting all the special snowflake points.

One major problem for me is that what people SAY and what they DO are very different. You say 'Define them however is appropriate for the context or however is right for you.' But I can't do that, can I? Because someone will come along and say MY definition is sexist, transphobic or whatever. If I say that, to me, identifying as a woman includes being female, then I'm called a transphobe. So the sentiment that 'define it the way that's right for you' barely seems to be practiced even by the ones advocating it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

For cispeople everything is totally ok, nothing feels wrong or out of place so there is no thinking about gender identity unless prompted to do so.   The 'progressive' understanding of gender comes from transpeople, who have a very unique experience with gender, and as a result a lot of cispeople, myself included at one point, expect that they can't be cis because they don't have any feelings of connectedness.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"In my perspective, the divide of gender and sex did its part in the past, especially to highlight the social construction and power dynamics.   The problem I (and others like Stefan Hirschauer >> Undoing Gender <<) see, is that it still naturalizes sex as a pre-existent thing Biology and Medicine stumble across. The vid shows, that the concepts in those disciplines are flawed (or more precisely: often misused), but it still gives them the credit of an essentialist observation and thus making the naturalist scientist to modest witness, to speak in Harawayian terms.    I recognize that, as ContraPoints highlights in the comment section, that this is a 'giant topic' and thus 'shortcomings' (as I perceive it) are inevitable.   I'm looking forward to the video about the relation of Gender and Biology and what's your take on (realism vs. construcitivism?).   Your content give me something to think about. Often I agree on a general level, but see specific topics different. That sharpens my reflexivity and positioning, helping to formulate thoughts.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Sex is discrete characteristic not a spectrum, your argument for sex fails with even the most basic understanding of biology. All of those sexual characteristics (breasts, hormones, vagina, ovaries) all of these are DIRECT consequences of your sex chromosomes, X/Y, which even you admit is binary. It is not enough to say that there are people with genetic problems e.g. XXX or XYY chromosomes, these are not naturally occurring and result from errors during meiosis and are not transferable through generations. Furthermore, in most of these cases the body 'self-corrects' and deactivates the expression of genes through those chromosomes through methylation. Despite all of this, the argument still fails as logical falacy called 'exception that proves the rule', where you are trying to use a 1/85,000 event to discount the overwhelming predictive power of sex to determine sexual characteristics. Science is not perfect and on some occassions makes  exceptions to laws (when there is good reason), but your argument attempts to use an exception to reject a law which is non-sense. That being said, since we live in a liberal society you can delude yourself to be whatever gender you want that's fine.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Feminist theory isn't the only social theory that explains 'Gender'. Behaviorist have their own complicated explanation for your own and similar sexualities that differ from Feminist hipotesis. But personaly I find psychoanalytic theory explanations much more refined and precise. Even Freud's 100 year old explanation on sexuality is way better. Check out the Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (German: Drei Abhandlungen zur Sexualtheorie), sometimes titled Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex, is a 1905 work by Sigmund Freud which advanced his theory of sexuality, in particular its relation to childhood.  Psychoanalytic theory postulates that a particular sexual drive, the principal component for 'gender' has definite characteristics: the source, the intensity, the object, and the goal. Feminist theory ignores every other aspect of gender as defined by Freud, ultimately half-hearthedly recognising 'the source', which are biological components such as postulated on this video by you.  To answer the question 'what are you', i'd need to go deeper and I don't consider it to be apropiate on the comment section of youtube, Though I would venture and say that the question is badly phrased. You are thinking of yourself as an object, you are not a 'What', but a 'Who'. 'What' is the domain of biology; 'Who' is the domain of Gender. Perhaps such objectification is the source of your misconceptions.   Ultimately, the point still stands. There are many more social theories that explain on detail different perspectives on why most feminist models on psychology are particularly wrong. Most of it has to do with the fact that feminism was first a political movement and then became a formal ideology.  Though there is middle ground, since there are a lot of psychoanalist that consider themselves feminist (though most would not agree with your conception of gender), I'd recomend Julia Kristeva but only if you are familiar with the 3 essays.   Is not that the 'general public' is right. Is that acording to many other experts on the subject you are wrong.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hey I live near the sculpture of a chair that nobody sits on!!! I really liked this video, it gave such a good insight into the matter. But I have questions!   I am of the view that a person's personality and character should have nothing to do with whether they are man or a woman (aka gender roles are bad). Therefore I fail to understand what 'gender identity' actually means - I say I am a woman because I have a vagina and not because I identify with society's idea of what a woman should be. Me being a woman has no bearing on who I am as a person.   However this seems to go against current thinking; that people have an innate gender identity which allows them to call themselves a man or a woman or neither as they wish. Is this not reinforcing the view that men and woman are a certain way (so if you dont act that way you're either trans or genderqueer, instead of just a woman who likes football for example)? I feel like I'm missing something important here in my understanding of gender so I would love if you could make a follow-up video on what 'gender identity' and 'gender expression' actually are.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think gender is a spectrum, defined by social constructs that are rooted in biological traits. It would make sense for most cultures to view men as the dominant, given our evolutionary roots. Men generally have stronger bodies and it's really important to take advantage of those differences in a hunter gatherer context where survival is paramount on having every advantage you can against nature. It also seems to explain the relative expendability of men in society, as reproductively there's way less eggs than sperm, and pregnant women needed protection from predators in order to propagate the species. A big problem is that these days these biological factors are far less important, but they still play a disproportionately large role in society determining gender. I don't think that the archetypal biological man and woman will ever be categorically identical, but we've definitely got a ways to go in terms of adjusting how important biological factors are in determining gender to be more proportional to how relevant it actually is in this day and age.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Obviously this is a giant topic that many academic careers are devoted to, and you can hardly solve the puzzle in a twelve-minute video, but I try to make a couple good points, which is the most you can expect from a YouTube thing.  One thing I didn't talk about much is the relationship between gender and biology. Gender is a social construct, but it does have some relationship to biology (as does everything human, since we are organisms). By relationship, I do not mean, 'male hunters on the savannah provided for their families therefore it's natrul for men to have the white collar jobs.' I mean that gender as we know it is the culturally evolved form of a system designed to deal with our dual roles in sexual reproduction. But of course in typical human style it's now a whole baroque thing that has little direct relation to reproduction. It can, and I'd argue should, be altered. But that's a topic for another video.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"*'Be a man'*  Here's a list of manly things I've done: *Swam two mile-long races, competitively* *Captain of my water polo team for 2 years, during which time we won 3/5 games the first year and 4/5 the second year.* *Won both my school's sit-up challenge (most in 60 seconds) (and the most we can do without stopping)* *I came second in the school's arm-wrestling challenge* *I won the long-distance running challenge at school against other guys who prided themselves on their speed* *I've won a silver medal in Breaststroke in a Championship* *I've won every physical fight I've ever been in. 2/2 both claimed to be the best fighters in the school* *I got ripped at the gym by the age of 16. I never even realised I was ripped until people started nicknaming me, 'Big Man ...* *I've worked through every psychological issue I've had with anything. My only worry now is what people would think and say if they knew I was a girl on the inside.* *I am an active team member in everything I do and I partake in activities regularly*  I've undergone tons of powerful hypnosis to give myself a manly-man mindset. It led to me developing bipolar disorder, and I would bottle up my feelings, and get extremely defensive about when people questioned my masculinity, or rather, I tried to convince myself that I should be extremely offended. I wasn't. When I look at it in terms of myself, I found the *implication* offensive rather than the word, because I had gone through so much to try and prove to myself that (yes, I am more of a 'man' than most men will ever be) but I identify as a girl. Through everything, it was the girl who told the masculine body to keep going, don't give up, keep trying. But the voice inside from the beginning was always a girl's; not my mum's. Mine. My own voice. All this history which increased my testosterone, got me ripped and made me the ( *maybe there's something dodgy about that person, they've raged a few times but are trying to be the best them* 'man' I am today). If I felt like this was all myself, I should be admired, I should be popular, I should be literally the king of my entire school. I have confidence in spades. I help people wherever they deserve it. I have good advice to go around. No one tells me what to do. I am not afraid of anything. I could be so many people; a police officer, a pilot, a detective; a business manager. I am smart enough to figure out how to do every job. And yet I still want to be a girl.  The only thing I am afraid of; who I am, and who I might really be I just never feel okay and like myself. I know who I should be as a man. The picture is so clear in my mind, well thought out and rational. And yet I subconsciously don't want it. And there is nothing standing between me and that, that it doesn't feel like me.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"*Hiya! A note to trans women, I can advise you on how to get the higher voice you'd like.* Not all of you like singing, but it will take time, and this is how I did it. You have to practice singing, and lots of it. Practice a range of notes, especially high ones. *Funnily enough, I helped myself get a higher voice. One that especially helped was singing Bohemian Rhapsody. Note: your lungs and throat will HURT, like HELL. But that's all the process of your lungs becoming stronger in different places, and your voice box becoming stronger.*","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I am cis but my genetics suck and I am naturally just hairy all over and I hate it. I feel like less of a woman. I hate the fact that I have to get my face waxed every two weeks. I pinch, measure and obesses over inch of my body. I seriously considered removing ribs just to have a smaller and more delicate waist.

On the subject of hair loss, it doesn't happen like this for everyone, but I've noticed that in a lot of cases it does grow back to a certain degree once you start taking HRT. Again, it depends on how bad the problem is when they start taking HRT, but most trans people that I know who had that issue have reported new hair growth.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I suppose I may still try the girly clothes, I am not very feminine in my body shape, but I guess I can try... Shit, I hate this. I can't even be a fucking normal woman because, again, my body is quite androgynous, like im shaped more like a man, except for my small boobs, because I have no butt and no curves and no nothing!

Where every day and night I fight to validate my existence when I know I shouldn't have to. Ironically my appreciation for feminine expression came from the grace and elegance of trans women. I greatly enjoy seeing such creative expression on Contrapoints videos. I have nothing against womanhood, im just not a woman. And I will often conflict with cisgender men I know. I realize they are lost as well in this weirdly gendered game of social norms. We have to stop hiding behind the labels that define us, and define ourselves.

"I can kind of relate to trans woman, even though I am cis gay guy. I mean, I don't identify as a woman, but I do identify as effeminate. What do I mean by 'effeminate'? I am effeminate in the traditional sense, I am: non aggressive, I believe interdependence, shy, passive, home oriented, super moody, gentle, sensitive to other's feelings, kind, tactful, nurturing. On top of that, I dance shirtless to electronica, I love fashion, I love home decor, I love theater(I love performing arts in general), I am limp wristed, I am swishy, I talk with a lisp, and I prefer fruity cocktails and red wine over beer. I used to be embarrassed about being femme, but now I wear my queerness as a badge of honor. While I have absolutely zero intention of transitioning into a woman( I want to look like the gods from Greek mythology),I get frustrated, annoyed, saddened, when people tell me that they are fine with me being gay, so long as I don't act like I am gay.  I had to put on an act for people, just so I could blend in, and all it did was ruin my self esteem. So I kind of get where trans women are coming from; dissatisfaction with physical experience, an intense dislike of being told to act like a 'man', choosing whether you want to live authentically and be an outcast, or fit in society and be miserable.  All I can say is use self affirmation, tell your self that you matter, and that so long as you are happy with your self, then it does not matter what society thinks about you. It has been working for me for the past three years, and I feel like I am finally out of that dark pit of despair.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

But I feel like this video captures gender dysphoria really well, with the swirl of negative thoughts, the anxiety, depression, constant disgust with your physical appearance. I wish more people realized how destructive gender dysphoria can be to the mental and physical well being of a person.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I am not a trans woman, but I identify as an effeminate cis gay man, and I can somewhat relate to this. When people tell me ' grow a pair',' be a man', etc, it makes me feel like a complete nobody. I feel that if I were a masculine, butch, dominant man, people would respect me, validate me, and treat me like a normal human being. Since I am not only gay, but effeminate, I have been usually treated with disdain, and humiliation from family, friends, and classmates. I used to feel worthless, I used to feel like a freak of nature, and no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't be a 'man'. Now days, I use self affirmation to deal with these negative thoughts. I constantly remind myself that I am special, that I have value, that I have purpose, that I am fabulous, and that I am proud. I tell myself that as long as I value myself, it does not matter what anyone else says about me. And to be honest, it is been working for me for the past few years. I feel more confident in my skin, and I feel like I don't have to pretend for people. I have no intention of catering to people if it means that I have to be miserable. So long as I am happy with myself, fuck what other people think.  Good video btw, people need to realize that gender dysphoria is a medical condition, and that being transgender, nb, queer in general, is not some lifestyle choice.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've always been a tomboy, my mother was convinced I was lesbian for a long time, sometimes I thought... 'Well, I'm not a girly girl, I'm not interested in fashion, and all the other girly stuff so I must be a lesbian'... Then I heard about transgenderism and thought I could be a 'man trapped in a woman's body's. Then I started to seriously consider  becoming a man.  After a while I just accepted that I'm just a slightly 'masculine' woman. I don't want to become a man but neither am I very effeminate.   I understand that disconnection between body and brain... And everyone who experiences this has to reach their own conclusion. Do what makes you feel happier within yourself as long as nobody else gets hurts.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"idk if anybody will see this but i need advice. my friend has been struggling with their gender expression recently and i want to be able to help them. they were crying the other day because presenting masculine helps them feel so much better about themselves yet their family doesn't allow them to, their sister accusing them of being gay (they're bi) and not approving of a _girl_ being masculine. they don't think they're trans, at least they tell me they don't, but also don't feel comfortable looking or identifying as femme. they were talking about how when they're with girls they want to be the more masculine one or 'big spoon', they were when we dated, but also feel that way with guys and not being able to makes them uncomfortable since they tend to take on the more masculine position by default. their long hair makes them uncomfortable, exposing their chest, wearing dresses, on and on. i hate seeing them so uncomfortable and upset, they are literally my everything and the reason i'm alive and they already have sommuch to deal with. i want to help them understand how they identify and feel, i want them to feel happy with who they are and really understand everything. i know a lot about trans people, sometimes i feel uncomfortable in being femme but i don't personally think i'm trans since i don't experience it often, just sometimes. anyway, advice on helping them? because i can't stand seeing them so upset and they're just now opening up about all of this.  also,, how do you ask about somebody's pronouns? i have a friend who keeps talking about dysphoria and identity crisis and how they experience it but i'm not sure how to ask how i can help them and use the pronouns they prefer to lessen their dysphoria which seems to be very bad at the moment. thanks.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The depiction at the beginning sounds exactly like my thought spirals. I have general anxiety and depression, manifested largely as hypochondria and an irrational fear of instant death.  The thought spirals often start with something innocuous, moving onto something serious, then to something extreme, before logic takes hold. 'my left arm feels kind of sore, is my heart in arrhythmia? Did a blood cut form in my legs and make it to my brain? Can I feel my face? Is the left side of my mouth drooping a little?... your heart rate isn't even that high and your damn mouth isn't drooping you fucking scared piece of shit stop freaking out over literally nothing.'  I haven't had suicidal ideation in some time but that end point would also be where I'd start thinking about how my brain is defective since I'm almost always in some level of fight or flight without medication, how I'm worthless and not worth wasting time and energy on, and that I'd get a double whammy of greatness by relieving the burden on my loved ones while taking control of my death by just choosing when and how to do it myself.  So yeah, this hit pretty close to home even though I'm a total 'meh' on the gender thing, which I think basically makes me a happy cis male.  I wonder if there's any real value to be mined on the similarity between dysphoria and hypochondria in some patients.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You said not to watch these now, so...sorry, I did anyway. This video is particularly raw/moving/honest (I'm a recent subscriber and have binged many videos since). Overall, I find you immensely strong and courageous. I understand why watching this would be hard for you now, and I just want to say as a cis queer woman, your work (aka channel) is one of the best things I've ever discovered on YouTube and I hope you experience less gender dysphoria every day (my only comparison is the occasionally-crippling imposter syndrome of trying to be a female in spaces outside traditional 'womans work'). I know a stranger's opinion won't have much sway, but truly even in these earlier videos all I see you as is woman, sometimes more 'butch,' but unquestionably, I hear and see you as a [very well-read, wise, witty] woman. ...sorry for the alliteration xD ... I don't say that to guilt trip you not to make whatever changes will bring you more joy, I hope you just read it I see you, at least as far as you have shared on the videos I've seen thus far...

I do not experience gender dysphoria, but I also have never seen my biological sex as being a significant part of my identity.  Like, I acknowledge that I am male, but I am indifferent to that fact, if that makes sense.    When I try to imagine what being female would be like, my indifference does not change. I mean, I can't actually know for sure, but I believe that if I were female, I would be indifferent to that fact as well.

"As someone who's so far deep in the closet she could recommend restaurant tips, I was raptured by this video. Okay, maybe the word 'raptured' is a bit much? But I was drawn in. I think I'm mtf but I've ever talked with a gender therapist and due to having 0 money I can't afford someone qualified to help me deal with my stupid emotional baggage.   Like the hairline thing doesn't happen to me because I'm not as old as you (idk how old ya are but idc as much the point was still poignant), meanwhile the alienation to my genitals I can relate to (that bit was both very comedic and metaphorical), meanwhile the Tumblr bit was haunting considering I struggle with the criticism I think you were referencing (rapid gender dysphoria, I think? basically you go online and then see some trans content in some nature, then boom you're Trans but not REALLY???), and yet I get so anxious whenever I shave my body, and I can't help but feel myself. Who else could I be?  So what is this nonsense?! Am'I confused because I'm actually Trans and am being influenced by false information? Or rather is it that I'm a man in reality? If that's the case then am I being harmful to the community by trying to explore myself, or is this really appropriation? Am I just too wrapped up in my head...    AHEM.... but really this was an interesting experimental artistic representation of Gender Dysphoria.

This film was so moving and intense and painful and beautiful. You're so fucking strong to have made this. I can't imagine how difficult it was. Also, you're a damn talented filmmaker.

"the hair stuff really got to me. after struggling with gender identity for 5 years, I finally found peace with being an androgyne ... and now my hair has slowly been thinning out. I literally worry about it every hour of the day. I check it every time I go to the mirror and every time I get out of the shower. each time, I swear that there's new hair fall. I've gone through the conversations in this video many times: 'Am I actually going bald? No... I'm just crazy' to 'Yep, my hair is definitely falling out and I am balding' in a matter of minutes. it's a terrible terrible feeling.  my hair is the only quality that I truly love about myself and now it's going away... once it reaches a certain point, I will no longer be an androgyne, I will just be a balding man who was once pretty but now looks fucking weird. I love wigs... but sometimes I just want to present as naturally as I can. and my hair really helps me feel like myself in that regard. I'm hoping to go to the doctor soon to see if I can get on finasteride (which I think will be beneficial for both my hair and gender presentation) but I just hope to god that it's not too late and some of this is reversible so I can have a full set of beautiful hair again.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

If all the gender roles are getting mixed up anyway, isn't it possible to dress and act feminine and even take hormones, but keep the penis and date within the pool of people who are attracted to that?

"Have you read Mercedes Lackey's fantasy books? Magical horse companions, like huge My Little Ponies but more badass. I realize how ridiculous that sentence is. Anyways, there's a culture in there that has sorta sexual healer/therapist types who often have a blending of genders which gives them unique insights for helping people heal from emotional damage. Your video brought them to mind for some reason. I think it's because all this pain seems to be comparing yourself in this either/or habit instead of embracing the mix. I bet that the spiritual person for a lot of tribes throughout history was often intersex or gender-mixed because they'd see things differently. Imagining David Bowie, there's a power to androgyny. Seems silly to try to abandon that to choose a simulation of either side instead of being the wonderful mix that you are. I've had a similar issue from being bisexual and not really identifying with a lot of the masculine ideals in the culture around me. But I've been feeling the Camus influence, not really in depth into absurdism, but the basic idea of accepting the apparent lack of meaning and just going on with life despite it instead of trying to fill the lack of an answer with random garbage. Or at least that's how I'm taking it, not sure if that's right. So I accept that I'm a weird little bi spaz monkey creature and that other people are their own special blend of crazy and we're all rushing about until we die. Since death is inevitable, I figure might as well witness the experience of being myself in the world as it is right now. I might go Steppenwolf and off myself when I'm old and my body feels like crap but maybe by then I'll like a little pain, feel alive at least. No telling at this point, 37 right now. Feels like I'll blink and be 65 and wonder where it all went. That'll be cool, I'd like to see my old face in a mirror, drop acid first then stare at all my wrinkles in a really good fall light, all warm. See all the tracks of experiences of my life written all over my body. There's a part of me that is so fucking afraid of that so there's this weird feeling of release by contemplating it and letting it wash over me, or maybe I just have to pee :)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Middle-aged trans woman here. This video is too real, so relatable. It makes me realize that I am not alone; what I went through and what I am still going through is not unique. I am not a freak, or if I am a freak, I am a freak in good company. I've stood in front of a mirror asking those same questions, ashamed, afraid, confused. I've looked at my body as I got old and fat and was upset, not at getting fat, but at getting fat in the *wrong* way. Hairline, voice, body hair, all that. F*ck, even that my legs are too short and my torso too long. I cannot understand your ability to share this with the world, your humility and vulnerability. It is heroic and beautiful. It is tragic. It is inspiring and frightening. The world, our current culture, needs you. As I hide and slither around the edges, you rise and burn bright. You teach. You make yourself a target. I am in awe.

"The first part involving the balding is something that truly resonates with me. And nearly had to pause the video at the facial/body hair part. I'm not trans, however I do feel gender dysphoria whenever I look at my hair. I have PCOS and hirsuitism which causes my sex hormones to basically be one big clusterfuck. In my case, I have the chromosomes and sex organs of a female, however, I grow excess facial hair (could be a full grown neckbeard if I let it go for a week or so. Usually shave every day though), gain weight, and bald like a man. I don't mean to equivocate my struggle to the struggles of the trans community, or try and make it about me when I talk about personal experiences with gender dysphoria. I guess I'm saying... I understand them feels.

"'Why won't you fuck me?' 'I don't want to.' 'Why not?' 'It makes me feel like a man.'  I want you to know this specific bit of dialogue made me realize a lot of things about myself I hadn't been able to articulate, or even acknowledge.  I'm 24 years old and I've only just realized my hangups with sex were inherently linked to dysphoria. Hell, I didn't even realize I *had* dysphoria, I just thought I was having bad sex. For me, more often than not, it's not even anything to do with genitalia, or even secondary sex characteristics -- speaking as someone who's slept with men and women and people of all genders, you just don't *hold* a man the same way you hold a woman (problematic as that may sound, because I still don't really have the vocabulary to express that more effectively.) My past sexual partners invariably perceived me as something I didn't identify with, and it made me crawl so far out of my skin that I couldn't enjoy any form of intimacy, let alone sex, without dissociating into the fucking stratosphere.  I watched this video on a whim, more to understand what my transfeminine friends go through than anything, but that line -- 'It makes me feel like a man.' -- that literally hit me so hard I had to pause the video and process it for a minute. I always thought I was one of the lucky ones whose dysphoria is quiet, almost kind -- I always told people I didn't really *get* dysphoria, because in most ways... I didn't. I liked the way I looked, because I knew I looked good, even if it was in a way I couldn't identify with. I thought I couldn't really feel like I was in the wrong body if gender itself didn't feel like anything more than a performance to me. But when it comes time to let someone put their hands on me, when I can't hide the telling parts of me, I feel exposed -- like they saw me for who I am when there was still an element of mystery, but the second the clothes hit the floor, the pretense is gone. And I can't bring myself to be angry with them, because they don't even know they're doing it.  Maybe this is too much information. Maybe I'm getting a little too vulnerable here. There's obviously more to it than just the sex, but that's the part that revealed the most emotional baggage for me, and I've still got a ways to go before I'm done unpacking. I still haven't even figured out how to address that problem, but at least it's got a name now. All I can hope is that this show of vulnerability can help someone put words to what they're experiencing as much as this video did for me.  Anyway, I've been meaning to come back and thank you. I can't imagine how difficult this must've been to film, and you've got my undying respect.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I don't know how anyone could watch this and not just fall in love. Seriously. I'm a trans guy, VERY early into my transition, and I feel a lot of this (just like, the opposite). Like the thing about sex- I honestly thought I didn't enjoy sex for a long time, until I met a man who accepted me as a man. Then I realized that the reason I hadn't enjoyed sex with other men was because it made me feel like a girl, and not like myself.  The hair thing. I seriously feel that, except the exact opposite lol. I look at the fine, light hairs that cover my legs and I feel hopeless. I look at my smooth, beardless face and I feel like giving up. I hear my high, pixie-like voice and I hate myself. It hurts so damn bad. The way I see myself in my head and the way I see myself in the mirror are unconnected, and it seriously fucks with me. I'm sorry that you have to deal with this, but I'm glad that you made this video and posted it, because it made me feel less alone. I'm sure other trans people feel the same. I hope the pain lessens. I hope you love yourself a little more every day.  Best, A trans brother Ps, your video editing skills are dope.

"'don't you feel like a woman?' 'No, I feel like myself.' 'well, exactly.'  I have someone close to me who is an FtM transgender person, and for two years I've been researching it and trying to figure out exactly what that means.  I can understand being unsure of your own identity, or even having an identity crisis and not understanding your psychology, your emotions, your desires, your feelings, your interests, your behavioral impulses, etc. As a man, I can even understand feeling feminine (i.e. having interests and mannerisms that are typically associated with females rather than males, that are regarded as feminine rather than masculine).  But is that all FtM trans people mean when they say that they feel like they're 'women in a man's body'? I get the impression that it's more than that: they also claim to 'feel' that they are of the opposite sex, not just the opposite gender.   What I can't understand is 'feeling' female (or male, for that matter). Sure, having an erection, and having sex as a male 'feels' a certain way, and that experience is not available to females. And I'm sure that having breasts and a vagina allows for certain experiences that are not available to males. So I can definitely understand that males and females have different sexual experiences. But is that all that is meant by 'I feel like I am in a male body' or 'I feel like I am in a female body'? Again, I don't think so.   As the video demonstrates, trans people also claim to feel something like dysmorphia: they feel that they shouldn't have the secondary sex characteristics that are typical of their sex at birth, and that their body should be morphologically similar to the other sex. For example, FtM trans people worry about hair loss, the size of their hands, their height, the width of their shoulders, the size of their head, the depth of their voice, facial hair, general body hair - I understand that they also feel that their penis shouldn't be there, so much so that some even try to cut it off themselves.  This is what's so confusing, I think: it doesn't 'feel' like anything in particular to have less hair, to have wide shoulders, to have a hairy body. These are not things you feel and are normally aware of, unless you consciously think about these things (even then, you can only concentrate on them, there is no 'feeling' or sensation associated with the length of your hair, width of shoulders, etc.). It doesn't 'feel' like anything in particular to have a male body (a body with male secondary sex characteristics), and I have a very hard time believing that females can 'feel' what it's like to have a female body (a body with female secondary sex characteristics).  So I simply cannot understand: what does it feel like to 'be' of a certain sex, let alone of the opposite sex? Do trans people simply wish they had the sexual experiences of the other sex, rather than the sexual experiences that they currently have?   And it's still not entirely clear to me what it 'feels' like to 'be' of a certain gender: does it mean that you have say feminine interests, behaviors, and mannerisms? But what counts as 'feminine' is simply what is the norm for women, and just because some interests/behaviors/mannerisms/etc. are the norm for women doesn't mean that every woman has them - there are butch women, tomboys, etc. who are no less 'women' for having interests/behaviors/mannerisms/feelings/etc. that are not typical for women. In fact, when people say 'woman', I don't think they mean 'someone who has the interests/behaviors/mannerisms/feelings/etc. typical of females and other persons with the gender role of 'woman' ', I think they mean something much closer to 'female'. So when an FtM trans person says 'I feel like a woman in a man's body', I don't understand: do you mean to say that you feel like a biological female with female-typical interests/behaviors/mannerisms/etc. inside a biologically male body? That's incomprehensible to me, because I don't understand what it means to 'feel like a biological male (or female)'. Do you mean to say that you feel that you should have the sexual experiences of the opposite sex? I can sort of understand that, though I have a hard time understanding how one could imagine what it feels like to experience sexual intercourse as the opposite sex, and to specifically want that experience (I could understand though if you DON'T want the sexual experiences of your own sex, because you've experienced them already, and you might not like them). Do you mean to say that you feel that your interests/behaviors/mannerisms/feelings/etc. are more typical of the other sex, so you identify with members of the other sex because you feel that your personality is more similar to them than to members of your own sex? But then, why not say you're just non-binary, or even just say that you are cis-gendered but you don't have all the typical personality traits that are typical of your gender?   I simply don't understand what they mean. So when I heard that little piece of dialogue ('don't you feel like a woman?' 'No, I feel like myself.' 'well, exactly.'), that made absolutely no sense to me. I don't know what it's supposed to mean to 'feel like a woman',  and the 'well exactly' raises even more questions. What does it mean?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"No one will ever see this, but maybe that's for the best.  I've been struggling with so much fear because of my gender identity. I know I'm a transwoman, but I'm too much of a coward to do anything about it. I mean, I've told my family and they are accepting and that's so great. So many trans people don't get that. I'm lucky.   But I'm still so afraid. I clicked on this video because I was going to convince myself that I wasn't really trans. But then you open up about obsessing about hair receding on that part of your head and I do that every day. I'm so tall. I'm 6'5. I'll never pass as a woman. I'm huge. I'm lazy. I can't do make up and hair every day. I'm so lazy. I have no fashion sense. I'd be a hopeless, ugly woman. Other transwomen would judge me for not trying hard enough.  I know some of this is irrational. And I'm usually a happy person. I wonder if it would be easier to just live as a man for the rest of my life. I don't have genital dysphoria, I just don't like penetrating people or having it sucked. But I don't hate it.   Haha, anyway. Um, great video!

But I suppose if I had this self hating dialogue going through my head all day I'd feel like every unthoughtful utterance from an otherwise caring friend was a hateful accusation, not to mention all the people who really did have it out for her or turned out to be an enemy in disguise. It was hard for me to sympathize completely with her because of that well earned bitterness, and even though every trans experience is different, your video makes me feel a little closer to what she went through in a way she perhaps couldn't express. I still feel like I sound like a fucking asshole. Sorry.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I don't know what it feels like to have gender dysphoria, but I hope I now have a slightly less naive idea of what it's like for those who do have it. It looks like it must be pretty awful to be unable to be comfortable in your own body and mind. And that is something I can understand.

I hope that isn't what this is.   I have spent this evening watching a good chunk of your videos, and I only wanted to say that you are appreciated and respected immensely here. Not only for your political and philosophical work  (which, I have to say is bomb as shit? the exchange of free information to better the world is, to say the least, one of the virtues of youtube that can challenge its vices, and thank you for doing something I could never do) but- as an artist, a person with immense creative worth, and what's more, as a person.   I don't know you, and perhaps the sort-of-late hour combined with the sudden influx of your content has given me a false sense of camaraderie, but there was so much of your content that struck me deep in my gut, the kind of place that is, at this point, kind of hard to reach? I feel- honestly kind of honored to have come across your work, and to have spent my time learning from your content. I'm a 19 year old complete dumbass too pompous for my own good, but.

You remind me of me in some ways other than just the being trans thing too - We're both musicians, both trans lesbians that were in egg mode forever, and then came out as nonbinary trans, and then came out as binary trans. And your musicianship is just amazing too. Solid multi-instrumental performance skills, and.. did you write that blues song just for this video?  You're so good at make-up and costuming and making videos too... I'd love to make videos some day too..

"This was great. Although I doubt I will ever experience the amount of gender dysphoria it takes to go motivate going through any sort of surgery I have my stints with it (for instance: I hate my hairy legs and never wears shorts, even when it's a million degrees outside, and shaving is too much of a hassle with the stubble and rashes and people starting to call you a fag so I don't bother). If I toy with the idea of one day for some reason I would wake up as a woman (and the different hormone levels didn't radically change how I behave) I THINK I would pretty much shrug and move on with my life much like I already do (after furiously masturbating for a few days with the new found parts off course). Getting rid of my body completely and live just as a consciousness is an idea far more appealing than change this fleshy shell I was born into. I have already lived most of life inside my own head and often feel eating and sleeping is a hassle with the having to interact with the outside world and everything. So transhumanism and the singularity would be the ideal thing for me I guess, too bad it's still just science fiction or science in it's infancy. ANYWAY, I had too much coffee, this was great.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Split hairs and all that, but having a penis doesn't bother me... all that much.  But it's my voice and my hair that sets it off the most... At least for right now. The back of my head, while not actually technically bald, is so thin that if I grow my hair out it might as well be. And yes, got the receding issue too. If I can get the money together, especially after getting on hrt (had a friend who showed some hair coming back once she was several months in, so there is hope for -some- reversal... some at least), I'm going to look into some of those hair options where they take some from the lower back of your head and set it up on the top in a way that is supposed to look natural...  Anyhoo, I'll try to finish this later, but it's hitting too close to home.  (also, *wave* finally got the courage to check your vids out.

"My brother is trans....so I guess my....sister now? I love him/her to death, I really do, but I'm still not sure how to deal with it. I'm bi, so you'd think I could relate, but I'd hate to say I really don't get it at all. For a long time I thought being trans was a mental illness, and sort of still do. I can get him being gay (which he is, by his own admission), because people like to fuck, have different tastes, and there's plenty of evidence suggesting that it's largely genetic (I think I can attest to that firsthand), and even him being more effeminate because, I mean who gives a fuck if he prefers painting his nails to playing football?  But I just don't get why someone would go to such great lengths to make themselves the opposite sex, or actually believe themselves to be it. I mean if you want to dress up and shit, fine. But to me there's a world of difference between that and 'I want to cut my dick off and swap it out for a non-functioning pussy'. He wants to transition, do the surgery and all that once he gets the money. As someone who wants to be a father, it just seems nonsensical and unnatural to me, even morally wrong in a sense, to give up your ability to have kids, or even get off, (no offense to you, but can you? Have you actually transitioned yet? I've heard the alternate sex organ they give you can't do that anymore) because he feels a certain way and might change his mind later. I mean....will he? How hardwired is this, and if you've transitioned, have you ever regretted your decision? This probably seems like a lot of questions, and I probably seem like a narrow-minded ass. But I'd most likely just say something that offends him or starts a fight if I tried being this blunt with him about how I felt.   As someone who seems like you could understand being in his situation, and possibly even mine, could you give me a bit of advice?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Rude but earnest questions: Why do you see yourself as a trans woman rather than as a feminine male? What's so important about claiming the word 'woman' or believing in the idea of a transition? Even if you were to frame it as a male with a so-called 'feminized brain' wouldn't that still be fundamentally a male? Why adopt the gender binary for self-definition when you can be free of it and not have to artificially invade a sex class you do not belong to? Aren't you really just trying to bend reality to fit an idea it can't really fit because one cannot change their sex just their gender presentation? Wouldn't it be more non-conformist to admit your sex class but refuse to behave according to it's gendered expectations? Why don't you believe in learning to love your body as is without having to make radical changes to it? Why is it so important that you fit people's expectations of what you should be, such as  the issue with having a feminine voice rather than practicing and cultivating self-acceptance?  What's wrong with keeping your voice as is and looking feminine? Don't you think there's something wrong with caring so much what others think?

"I've been looking into ethics and I kept going 'hang on a minute - this is all in Terminator 2!' - so I've been going back to that movie (watched a great 60 min presentation by 'Industry Workshops' on YoutTube from 11 months ago - gave me an overview of myths, story telling, visual narrative, and character arcs, but also how to engage lower and higher brain functions).   I started off with the stanford prison experiment (and the BBC re-run in 2002, which went differently but still ended up with tyranny). Then moved onto to Ethics of Care versus Ethics of Justice (Gilligan vs Kohlberg) and naturally went from that to thinking off a female mental institution experiment versus the male stanford prison experiment - thinking about Empathy and Relationships versus Power and Entitlement.... Things that feature in Terminator 2 (but is not represented in Sarah Connor's mental institution as a place of Empathy in contrast to the Stanford Prison Experiment as a place of Power - as Sarah's mental institution is shown as being no different to a Prison in that sense). Ethics of Care vs Ethics of Justice get chracterized along gendered lines - so maybe it's not a real distinction or it's platitudes ect?   I had already been researching gender identity in the brain though, which seemed to be down to a dominance of the Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis (BNST) in the 'reptilian' brain in males (driving masculine aggression and favouring action) as a result of oxytocin receptors in the BNST (that are fewer in females in the BNST) versus more reliance on the limbic cortex in the brains of females (allowing for more emotional cognition). These findings, if correct, are controversial because it would indicate that men are more adapted to deal with physical stress than women. And also that women have more of an ability to deal with emotional stress (the stereotype of the male flying of the handle with aggression when things go wrong versus the calmer female who tries to work through a problem)... These features of the brain appear swapped over in transgender individuals. I am not an expert though.   ...I've thought about this in terms of feminism and concluded that the goal of feminism should be to improve male and female mental health (regularly being aggressive reduces grey matter in the brain and leads to psychosis). The problem is that the BNST via oxytocin ties into social identity (mental memory and also muscle memory) - literally gender identity. So feminism requires more than just altering social constructs of gender but to succeed requirest males to compromise their prefered mode of being - something a gentleman should already be able to do.   As the BNST is less active in females (removing the BNST in males leads to more feminine type behaviour) I am less certain of where female gender identity arises from as it seems not a simple case of attributing it to the BNST (so called what causes transgenderism). However, new research indicates that memories form in mutliple areas of the brain at once to be later intergrated together to reinforce a memory. So it could be that females reliance on higher brain regions compared to males could be where the female gender identity resides? - as all memories require oxytocin, which is a social hormone.   Males do have more grey matter in their BNST and Amygdalae than females, whereas as females tend to have a thicker layer of grey matter in their cerebral cortex than males (also reflected in scans of transgender brains). Though this finding is complicated by the way grey matter converts to white matter in the process of 'trimming' as we develop - white matter being faster established neural connections developing from repeated activity. So it could be that in the case of the right hemisphere - relating to physical activity - in which this is more evident, that females just have untapped potential? But then isn't hemisphere activity related to amygdalae activity, which is more dominant on the right side in males - this also relates to sexuality as in homosexuals dominance of the left or right amygdala is swapped over. But then sexuality and gender identity are different (as you get homosexual trans men and women). White matter seems more important for sexuality (including peadophilia) - maybe the key to gender identity is in the grey matter (e.g. amount in different regions of the brain)? - both in the 'reptilian' brain and the cerebral cortex?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"What is the 'Boon' for transgender people? I'm sure everyone is familiar with Star Wars - it was influenced a lot by Joseph Cambell's 'Monomyth', which was a generalised story arc of the Hero's/Heroine's Journey based on his observations of all the similarities of myths throughout the history of human cultures.   The 'Boon' is the goal or objective for the proganonist - such as destroying the Death Star for example...  The 'boon' is generally an achievement of both individual attainment and recognition by peers and a journey into adulthood generally as a respected member.   The Monomyth has three distinct sections: SEPARATION, INITIATION, and RETURN. Between each section is an event that creates a threshold moment - between Separation and Initiation Luke's aunt and uncle are murdered; between Initiation and Return Obi-Wan scarficies himself.   I think quite often for Transgender people there is a lot of pressure to 'stay on the farm' and get 'killed' by a Psychiatrist/Pyschologist Stormtrooper working within the system to prevent the transition from Separation to Initiation for the Transgender person - i.e. conform (die either spiritually or literally).  Obviously a problem is you can only get the 'Boon' if you play by the systems rules - if transgender people aren't even allowed to have the 'Boon' then how can they be part of the franchise?  Those who are lucky (or geniuses) or fight hard enough to tear themselves away from the ties that bind or just reach absolute breaking point between life and death, can find their own meaning in life and in a way that encompasses the human spirit - this may mean finding a higher purpose beyond the veil of the franchise and the system...   easier with the help of a mentor which is usually an experienced transgender person or transgender collective (their Obi-Wan) who knows how to get the system to work for transgender people.

I feel like my exterior doesn't match my interior, but why does it seem to matter SO MUCH!? Is it really so we can finally look at ourselves and finally, personally, allow those feelings to match, or are we only permitting our feelings to be 'real' once 'others' or 'the outside' ALSO allows or believes it as 'real'?   Wouldn't that mean we're just lost, trying to be a stereotype? Shouldn't we just be ourselves, but not feel a need to 'look' any way? Why do I feel like this shit will haunt me forever...

"I kant believe (sorry - bad joke) I can't believe I am typing this in a comment box on youtube, but, philosophically, is the cosmological string theory in physics transphobic? No seriously. I should explain that I have been attacked by a persistent TERF for about a month now on and off, and I ended up calling her a 'social darwinist'. I thought I'd read a bit more about the term and came across an unexpected link with 'Monism' and I though 'hmmm... don't I have monist views about cosmology?'. It is difficult for me to define exactly how I view the universe, but anyway I was more in favour of string theory over the multiverse theory (even though this theory makes sense in terms of quantum physics - 'everything that can happen does happen'). I guess I am a bit of a perfectionist, and I know that is bad for not just transphobia but viewing human beings in general. I also rejected descartes mind dualism... so does that mean I'm a monist - fuck? I'm a bastard. But hang on... There's existence pluralism (or priority plurism..  I have no idea), but basically the 'universe' in a monist view would have the cosmos made up of just one 'verse' or 'song'. Whereas as a multiverse would have 'multi-verses' or 'multi-songs' - perhaps infinitely many, like infinitely many ripples on a pond combining together...  that is actually more how I see the cosmos. I still think there is only one univese but I think it is made up of many verses combined (in a way much more abstract than the multiverse hypothesis - like the quantum approach.... it's just all in the maths). So I guess I hold a pluralistic view. But I hadn't really considered if how I view existence was affecting how I viewed everything else. I guess maybe it could help being less of a perfectionist? Maybe I need to also think about how I view the mind as well. That TERF is still at me...   I'm just going to ignore her because she won't accept defeat.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Great video!  Changing the body to match the mind, or changing the mind to accept the body.  Is either more or less ethical depending on what the person wants?  But changing the body to match the mind using hormones also changes the mind.  I wonder if the bulk of suffers (if that is an appropriate term) of gender dysphoria would suffer it, if generalized gendered social expectations were different from what they are now.  But aren't those expectations, if they are really expectations in the current zeitgeist, built on generalized norms of behavioral characteristics that extend beyond social input and have a biological foundation?  I would think the biological foundation of gendered expectations would find strong evidence in the existence of gender dysphoria.  As in, (while there is much gray area in personality and behavior between the biological sexes) do males with gender dysphoria ever fit a stereotypical male behavioral template and vise versa or do they usually exhibit the behaviors of the other sex?    As a side note, I have caught on that there seem to be multiple meanings for sex and gender, while they are interchangeable have usually meant physical biology but also mean something different from physical genetic expression to encompass something different.  As in gender dysphoria, to my understanding, means to feel dysphoria about your genitals not who you are as a person (more masculine vs. feminine).  It seems that our feeling that we are a something in the driver's seat of a body, looking out from behind the eyes leads us to the belief that we are something more than our bodies.  That the mind has a sense of permanence that the body doesn't.  The same mechanism that gives most the belief in a soul or afterlife or reincarnation.  Therefore changing the body is of no consequence, where changing the mind would feel like changing the person into a different person.  It is near impossible to imagine changing the only thing you know, yourself.  Where the record of your changing body over time through age is there to see, the change in your mind through age can prove to be more elusive.  However, changing the mind to accept the body might not create a major change in personality, perhaps only a lining up of mind and body leaving the personality intact.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thank you SO much for making this.  In my teens / early twenties, I struggled with gender identity.  I was born male, but didn't consider myself masculine, and in fact found most hyper-masculine behaviour to be repellent and scary.  I dabbled with transvestism, and found some sense in privately presenting as female, but never felt comfortable enough to take it public.  I'm in my late 30s now; I've made huge strides in reconciling my own masculine and feminine sides, and am happy identifying as male, even while there's still a 'female' part of me which goes unexpressed.  And, honestly, I've no idea *who* I would be now if I'd been exposed to the idea of transgenderism when I was younger.  All this to say: thank you thank you thank you for sharing your personal experience (and so entertainingly at that).

"You know, this video isn't just being funny, entertaining and honest for the sake of a YouTube video. It's much more; this video is amazing. As someone who doesn't have any gender dysmorphia (that I know of at least, I'm the opposite of who you think of when you imagine 'perfectly normal and well-balanced' so it may play a role. I personally doubt it though for some reason) I can say that this really helps me understand what it must be like, even if I can never truly understand the full implications of the problem on someone who's going through/has gone through it. I think it might sound stupid at first, but I think the highest praise I can possibly give to a work such as this is: I get it. I understand now in a way that I didn't before. Thank you for broadening my empathetic vocabulary.  On a technical note, the video was done well. Most shots had a nice fore, middle, and background, but cleverly choosing to change that for the hallucination. The shots were symmetrical and visually pleasing or interesting for the most part, and this also had a sense of color and life that's rarely seen anymore (well, maybe you see it a lot on YouTube, but it feels fake, dishonest and usually disorganized with colors that don't match or convey a feeling that fits with the video, or some other reason. Take your pick, there's a million of them) It was more like the breadth and life of an Alejandro Jodorowski film. Plus, it had some very obvious, as well as some really subtle moments that were influenced by other great filmmakers and other artists. I now see your creative vision, and when I have disposable income, I imagine myself giving you money of patreon.  I do really hope that you do more content like this though. This was masterful Impressionism, excellent use of color, great placing and decent blocking, original ideas and methods of conveying feelings that need to be better understood, and so much more that can't be quantified from my critical perspective.      Incase my review of a YouTube video, (I know, a review of a YouTube video. Regardless of how good the video is, that's unquantifiably pathetic as a critic) here's the td;lr: Great video, watch it to get a better understanding of dysmorphia.

"when I was anorexic I used to keep journals with calorie numbers....I would use bracelets to make sure my upper arms were thin enough to fit what would fit around an average persons wrist.  I had certain rituals I would do every day to measure certain parts of my body. eg I decided my shoulders were too disproportionately big compared to the rest of my body. I failed exams due to checking these measurements and spent hours in the mirror going over these insane things...so ashamed that people would think i was vain...even though i hated myself. The more starved I got the more distorted my perception was. in hind sight...there was nothing abnormal about me. I Know Th is isn't the same as gender dysphoria...but I can relate so much to this video. For me it wasn't about fearing being the wrong gender...but being a woman as opposed to a girl. Having curves...having Boobs....which I used to flatten to make me less womanly. It was about staying a child. And believing that if I looked like one I wasn't sexually provocative.  It wasn't conscious. I just felt safer that way. I love you Contra. I hope these feelings ease AA they have for me","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It took me a long time to be more open-minded. Well, I never considered myself to be conservative but I had trouble understanding people with gender dysphoria and let's say I didn't have the nicest view on them. I wanted to understand though. It's obviously something a lot of people experience. And I started thinking... what if someone took away my identity from me? What if I didn't feel like a woman at all? What if everytime I saw myself in the mirror I thought I couldn't really change and morph my body into what I wanted it to be no matter how hard I tried? And then the realisation hit me. This video helped me grasp the subject even better.  I'm really glad you're making these kinds of videos, Contra! I hope they reach as many people as possible. The effort you put into your videos always amazes me. The humor, the raw emotion, the empathy... They are very 'human' in nature if I can express myself that way.

"This is such a good film. Thank you for making it.  Even as a supporter and empathizer, I know I can never understand what goes on inside the mind of a trans person, not being trans myself, but I think I got a small insight. When I saw the 'why do I have hair here?' part I had tears in my eyes because I have a lot of hair in places no human should have hair (shaft and foreskin if you're wondering), and being a person of color, as a child i always felt it's because my ethnic group was inferior, less evolved, and are 'closer to animals'. It took me a long time to get myself out of that thinking. Still hate the hair though. :)   We are all disappointed with our bodies in some ways, but your video makes me think that gender dysphoria is all that disappointment on steroids and LSD, and all of it is perceived as how it takes away your body from its true gender. Good Lord, the cycle of being reminded of the flaws, depression, and forgetting long enough to be happy must be tiring. Too tiring. I've experienced some of that.  It must have been cathartic to point them out in public, instead of keeping them hidden.   I really don't know how to deal with my own body issues...I'm just hoping to find someone who actually LIKES the errors of my body. Maybe only then I can let go of it. I'm hoping the same for you. We should find imperfect people whose imperfections we can truly love, and maybe they are quite ok and even like our imperfections.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Being male doesn't bother me as much as it might as long as my male body is allowed to ... male.  (And it does a lot of that.)

"This hit much harder than I expected. As someone who by and large has to behave and present as a male, and who has experienced tons of Gender Dysphoria, I can relate to pretty much every single scene. I know what it's like to try on outfit after outfit, makeup, and everything else I can think of only to look in the mirror and see the most obviously masculine features. I know what it's like to despise the hair on my body which grows so quickly. I know what it's like to be rejected and made to feel worthless for being unable to be sexual with partners because of that. The part that hit the most home, as a singer and musician, was where you sat in front of the microphone discussing how your voice didn't sound feminine. That felt like it could've been me, to an exact tee. My voice is actually probably the worst, come to think of it... it's impossible to feel like I will ever be who I want, or express myself how I want. And all the people who tell me I should just do it or just be myself don't get that it isn't so much other's perception or their support or lack thereof that affects me, it's that I know that I cannot be in any way feminine convincingly, as much as I might want, least of all too myself. I...I don't know, I've rambled too much... this just hit me very hard... Thank you, Contra, this is one of the best representations I've ever seen describing how I, and I'm sure many others, experience Dysphoria.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I know I'm probably not the only boring trans(itioned) woman to tell you this, but I think you should give transition a serious try. So much of this BS that you've had like a ton of lead over you all your life ebbs away and you achieve a kind of calm you never thought you could have. I first took estro about 14 years ago and it was a revelation to me, all the emotional ill-fitting pieces just worked when I just let them sort out by themselves. Transitioning is not always pretty, but it allows you to become yourself and mostly (it takes time) forget about all the dysphoric nonsense. As for the voice.. I had (technically have) a baritone like you but I worked it into the voice I've been using for the last decade and a half and  I never have trouble passing. I even worked over the phone without a hitch. I still don't like my voice that much, and I really, really wish it was a pretty singing voice, but it works and goddamn it it's mine. It just takes some work to hit the right place, but when you do, it works like a charm. The training also allows you to extend your voice a ton. The website that helped me a ton in this regard (Amberspace) has since gone dead, but it's still on the wayback machine URL Sorry for the long post, but I quite enjoy your videos and wish you the best <3","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I only recently found your channel, and it was super random. I was watching one of Kat Blaque's livestreams, and someone in the chat mentioned your channel. So naturally I got curious and watched a couple videos, and I've been subscribed since. This video is really awesome, and I love how surreal the atmosphere is as you tackle a really serious and personal subject. The Anita Sarkeesian impression was so on point. Also, those goggles you wore as the doctor were so cool! Where did you get those? I've seen them in the thumbnails of some of your videos. One other things: while I do understand part of the point of the video was to be surreal and also satirical, I'm not sure how I feel about the comments concerning Jewish folks. Maybe I'm missing something, but it just rubbed me the wrong way. Anyway, enjoyed the video otherwise, and keep up the awesome work!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You're so fucking beautiful. Thank you for making this. I don't have gender dysphoria and am pretty vanilla when it comes to my gender expression, but I do know what it's like to hate one's own body and to think, 'This can't be my body, this can't be real.' The last lyrics of the closing song, 'Is this even real,' really drove that home for me. I used to be 100 lbs at 5'4', and a professional art model. After a couple of years, my lifestyle of...indulgences...caused me to develop adult-onset, life-threatening asthma. The meds I needed for my asthma subsequently caused me to gain about 40 lbs over the course of 2 years. It was really traumatizing, I couldn't even get out of bed the first day I saw stretch marks on my body. The calls for modeling jobs waned, and then stopped entirely. I didn't even want to have sex anymore because all I could think about was how fat I looked to my partner (which is not what he thinks at all).  So...I'm not comparing it to gender dysphoria, but looking in the mirror and not being able to live with what's there...yeah, I get that 100%.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I regularly think of myself being not manly enough, many others do probably have similar problems.  So, do you actively try to improve yourself or is it better to just accept who you are? I don't know for myself, but luckily the society accepts me as a small and skinny man much better than LGBTQ people. This movie opened my eyes to the struggle of such people.

"This is pure artistry. Pure expression leaping straight out of someone's soul. It's absolutely beautiful. Beautiful in that it conveys very uncomfortable feelings in a very artistic way. I will always say that I envy everyone with a platform upon which they can express their inner thoughts and ideas. I never really cultivated an artistic pursuit of my own, but you (Contrapoints) and many other artists have shown me that it's still possible. Seeing the development of your artistic expression grow over time has really inspired me.  About the video itself, I feel like I identify with some of this more than I've realized. I haven't experienced major dysphoria, but there's definitely a minor form of it I feel sometimes. I'm very uncomfortable with too much masculinity and I try to minimize it somewhat and exaggerate my more feminine traits to help balance it out. It's very striking seeing some of my own thoughts in this movie being expressed (even if they're to an extreme), and I feel like I understand dysphoria much more.  How would the general population see something like this? Hopefully they feel as uncomfortable as they were intended to feel, because it's all about delivering a subjective experience.   Anyway I basically love you, Contrapoints. This video is amazing. You're amazing. Keep doing more of whatever it is you do, please.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hopefully without sounding too prescriptive here, because I'm really not trying to be, I think it would help alleviate some of the pain you're feeling to at least explore the possibility of HRT. There's a community on reddit for DIY HRT (/r/transDIY), so you don't even need a doctor, which I know you've said was one of the reasons you were avoiding it. And you don't need a 'full' dose. You can control it yourself as long as you're monitoring your own levels. And you don't even need to add estrogen, right away. You could take justan anti-androgen for a couple months and see how you feel without male testosterone levels before committing or not.  Maybe you'll discover that your brain likes testosterone better, after all, and it's just physical things, which can be changed, that are the source of your pain. Maybe you'll find that a more female hormonal balance is better for you psychologically. You won't know until you find out, right?  And with all that being said. I'm not saying 'change your body.' I'm saying that I empathize very, very strongly with the emotions in this video, and from both my own experiences as a trans person as well as countless other trans people's experiences, both binary and non-binary, HRT does *a lot.* It's not just about the physical changes, it touches something a little deeper than that, as well. Something less tangible but at the same time very visceral than body dysphoria.  And if it helps at all, your voice is already pretty androgynous. It really is. But if you did want to feminize it a little more, then I really don't think it would take you very long to train it if you followed a good guide. Another trans community on reddit (seriously you should spend some time exploring the trans subreddits, a lot of them are super great) is /r/transvoice. There are guides people have posted on how to help feminize your voice the right way. It takes some practice, but you're a at a great starting point already. I think you'd probably have pretty quick results in finding a voice you're more comfortable with.  Anyway. I've rambled enough and you probably won't read this. But if you do, know that there are a lot of people who know a lot of what you're going through right now. Don't shy away from the experiences of those who have been down that road before. You don't have to shoulder all this on your own. :)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

And hopefully helps give cis people *some* idea of what's involved.   (In purely formal/aesthetic terms, I love the play with style and references; I've been watching your videos almost since the beginning and love this development.

The sex life part was what shocked me most because I always thought that you would have a healthy sex life...it's like, I never understood the gravity of your gender dysphoria...while I was watching that part first thing I thought was 'But there are trans woman that have a penis and still have a healthy sex life' which brings me again to the fact that I don't understand how gender dysphoria works and how differently it can affect various people.

Truly, everything about it, from the witty and honest script, the editing, the music, the gorgeous lighting, your outfits (that all-pink one in the strawberry eating sequence is so fucking good, my jaw dropped) - this an absolutely stellar piece of filmmaking. Thank you for being so courageously open and vulnerable on this way.   And I'm sorry that you've been struggling so much. As a trans person, I understand how fucking much dysphoria sucks. Everything you said here resonates with me so strongly.   It's my deep hope that you'll be able to see all the things that make you feel like less of a woman right now as more of one later on. You can be a woman with thinning hair, with body hair, with a deep voice, tall, with a dick - that's fine. None of those things define womanhood. And as a bigender fella that wants to be seen as more masculine, I get wanting to adjust your body and feeling such terrible guilt and shame when you can't be as malleable as you hope to be. But it's important to remember that gender is defined by us. We make it what we want.   All I'm trying to say, and probably failing at, is that I so deeply wish that you one day find peace in yourself, and love the magnificent woman as well as the wonderful man and all other forma of gender you may happen to be that you are. You are a brilliant mind and a creative soul before anything else. All my love. ","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I made this video based on personal experience. I didn't do any research for this one and instead opted to just like express myself. So my main goal is just to make art, but I also hope that depicting an individual experience of dysphoria in detail helps non-trans people understand it better.  I should say that this does not represent everyone's experience of gender dysphoria. AFAB (assigned female at birth) people will have a very different experience. People further into their transition will have a different experience.  Also, I identify as genderqueer, which is a complicating factor that I don't completely know how to make sense of. My dysphoric feelings are pretty 'binary' in the sense that it's mostly being non-female that hurts me, rather than being non-androgynous. The one really non-binary moment of this thing is the blues song, which is kind of a celebration of gender non-conformity and embrace of a masculine trait (my voice).  For people curious about the state of my gender situation, I'll just say for now that I'm still figuring it out. But enough about me, let's talk about me.
