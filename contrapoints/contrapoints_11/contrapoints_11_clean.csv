Why must people go through the struggle of losing connection with their gender when we should teach them that there is really nothing to connect to? It's just words to distinguish that your body is in alignement with your brain. It seems like  further establishing societal norms of gender when we decide that we must change our gender to escape them; like giving up ones own gender to justify who they are .","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I remember playing Skyrim near her, and the beefy guy at the Skyforge was there and she was saying he was a girl because he had long hair. And I was reminding her how some boys have long hair too, and this person was a boy because I had spoken to him in the game previously so I knew from previous conversations that he was a boy. I meant for this story to be more succinct... Point is, she was being cute with her idea of boys and girls and hair.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I agree with what you say here, but I don't think you addressed the best arguments people have against non-binary. To me, the biggest issue is that I get the sense that people who are nonbinary are simply people who don't fit into any stereotypical gender role, but that doesn't make them not the gender they were born in. Wearing dresses, pink and long hair may be stereotypically feminine, but they are not inherently womanly and sports, short hair and general aggression are stereotypically masculine, but not inherently manly. I get the sense that nonbinary people are saying that if you don't fit into the stereotype for one gender, then you are somewhere in between, but I disagree. I can be incredibly masculine but that doesn't make me any less of a woman, and same for men. It seems like nonbinary are actually enforcing gender roles by implying that if you don't fit into one gender role, you are not that gender. I have yet to hear anyone explain/refute this.   The reason I say I believe in only two genders is that no one has been able to articulate the difference between a person who doesn't fit into stereotypical gender roles and someone who is nonbinary. Obviously, I believe everyone should be treated with respect no matter what, but I simply don't understand nonbinary identities. However, I am absolutely open to hearing what anyone has to say on the matter.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Only just found your channel (thanks to my partner), and catching up a few years down the line.  I currently identify as apathetic female because I'll still answer to female pronouns, but really don't give a damn what gender (or body) I have.  I did the #30DaysOfGender challenge and didn't actually feel any closer to anything specific.  I am lucky enough to not be massively body dysphoric.  I used to be (in the female sense of wanting to be skinny with big boobs), but now I'm just glad my body, whatever state it's in, has got me this far in my journey through the stars.  Yes, I'd still like a bit less flab, but big scheme of things, it's not the end of my world.  However, (like you said in this), if I woke up as a different sex, I don't think my feelings about gender would change (my partner might get a surprise though!).  I'm not agender, because I'm not dysphoric being called female (or male, or anything), so apathetic (not giving a sh*t) seems to be more me.  One thing that resonated with me recently was one of Sarah Hendrickx's talks where she said her autism meant she didn't care about gender - she was just her.  I'm tempted to suggest there's an augender (autistic gender) or apagender (apathetic) where you just don't care because it's not really something you give a damn about and / or because it's not a special focus or something of interest that you feel is important.  I'm glad you've come to learn more about yourself so you don't feel as hollow anymore.  <3","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I have no problem with someone wanting to identify as Mayonnaise. FFS, I'm a furry. I identify as a colorful raccoon so being a total weirdo is my bread and butter. What bugs me is this insistence that we shape gender into this weird amalgamation of literally everything to suit any sparkly, unique individual's needs. There is no 'gender' that defines me. Same goes for you, and everyone who reads this comment. That is not now, nor has it ever been the purpose of gender. Gender just describes, broadly, where you fall in the spectrum of masculine-feminine. Frankly I think it's past its purpose and we need to reduce its emphasis and priority in society, not expand it. If gender is a box that stifles what you feel like you can be... why are we making MORE boxes? If we're in the business of changing the rules, let's actually change them in a positive way! I would think the public would be more open to not caring about pronouns than it would be to adopting several (hundred?) new sets of them... ugh.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Okay, so Mister Stuffy Raccoon is telling you you can't identify as mayo, then? No, you don't need gender for that. Allow me to enlighten you to a new concept I just made up: everyone gets their own gender, a completely unique word or set of words that describes you, which you can define down to whatever specifics you want to. It's called your name. It's not always completely new or totally unique in its spelling and phonetics, but you can always change it if that's what you prefer. Nobody would dare go against your legally defined name. None of you are uncomfortable using someone's screenname, either. So you not only get your real name to define yourself, but also your username(s) online, and even any nicknames you pick up. And you're even free to identify each one in a unique way. I'm totally free to make a new account, call myself PM_me_your_bird_pics and act like a totally new persona there.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"There's this weird thing going around where people act like gender is this super important identifier that you have to work within the 'boundaries' of. That's nonsense. We don't live in that world anymore. At least if we're in the business of changing that, let's stop ADDING to the importance of gender and conforming to it. We're giving it more legitimacy, more power over people, and that just breeds more of the kind of suckiness that led us here in the first place, even if there are now 70+ 'accepted' genders. Do I need to get into how the existence of 'FTM', 'trans male' and other similar genders only serve to de-legitimize trans people's efforts to change their gender? Nobody transitions to become trans, they transition to become male, or female.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i dont feel like you make compelling enough arguments. gay isnt a gender. its males/females admitting they sexually like other males/female of the same gender. i dont support or believe trans. i dont believe its a real thing. i really do think its people who are confused. you can be a 'man' and wear womens clothes. you can be a 'man' and present yourself as a women. the only thing man and woman means is what meat you do or dont have in between your legs. i do think that people who change 'genders' are not really changing ganders. what they are changing is is if they are feminine or masculine. and the last time i checked male and female have absolutely nothing to do with those roles. its true the each one falls into a stereotype but thats true of all things in life. there will always be a majority of 'something' that always fits into 'something' that doesnt mean that 'something a' owns 'something b' i believe that is where trans and non binary gendered people are getting confused. 'he, she' do not refer to the clothes people wear. 'he' means you make sperm. 'she' means you make eggs. thats it. thats all it means. the reason why people feel attacked when you try to change that is because people 'like' knowing who makes eggs and who makes sperm so the people who like egg makers can know whos making eggs and the people who like sperm makers can know whos making sperm. thats it. its 'that' simple. its been around for a long as people have.    you are not male just because you look the way most males choose to look. similarly, you are not female just because you choose to put on a dress and wear makeup. at best you can remove the fact that you are male and be neither male or female. yes there are 3 genders. there is male female and none. what trans people often do is they make themselves 'none' in their goals to traverse the divide. but thats as good as it gets. even if you grow boobs you cant cant make yourself a woman and even if you chop off your boobs you still cant make yourself a man.   this goes for hormones too. just because you take things that make you fake doesnt change the fact that its fake. you have no organs in your body that produce those hormones naturally because you 'not' that gender. gay people go through a similar crisis i think. they try as hard as they can to be straight. but biologically they are gay. their bodies are biologically attracted to the same gender. im sure there are hormones gay people can use to make themselves feel like a straight man, but they would be lying to themselves. your dealt the cards you have from birth. just because you dont feel 'manly' and you 'feel' womanly doesnt change that your male. your just not a manly male or maybe your not a womany female. and thats 'ok'  you dont have to change who you physically are to be accepted as a person.   you can wear dresses and makeup and all those pretty clothes and still be a man. same with women. no one says you have to wear all those frilly things. we will accept you as a manly woman, but it is sad that these people cannot accept who they are. thats why its so hard to be trans i think. not only dont they accept who they are, but because their being who they are not, others dont accept them either. and in their quest to make themselves into something they are not they try to force people around them to accept the lie by getting laws changed so people are forced to play along with them or be killed by police. that is not the way you get people to accept you. you dont go around forcing people to respect you. people earn respect. even if you get the police to make people co-operate with your lie they will still hate you, except now they hate you more for forcing them.   i should also point out that i remember there is physically another kind of gender too and thats people born as both man and women. (physically) that is due to them having the DNA of both. they normally have more DNA then any 1 male or female.  to end, i think it would be nice if everyone was 1 gender and capable of having sex (kids) with anyone else. then there wouldnt be a trans, or a gay or any of these problems we have today. people would just choose to be and look any way they felt like. they would love anyone they felt like loving. i would love a future like that because all this hate and confusion just rips people apart.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I get it it mostly depends from your style, but I felt you set the bar of the argument too low: you start with arguments 'against' non-binary gender (already a quite ill defined frame), but then you reply to the tougher arguments by moving to discuss the 'existence' of non-binary genders. Once you define a gender as 'what I feel like', there is no reason to discuss that question: I cannot discuss if someone does or doesn't feel non binary, everyone agrees on it. I wouldn't say this is a complete strawman - there are indeed comments on youtube claiming that those people are wrong in believing something - but it's setting the bar on the very uneducated. More interesting and more debated questions is if it is important to recognize those different genders in our society, if there are chemical basis (as there are for gender dysphoria), if it is useful to change our vocabulary to accomodate their need. These are the debated points, and I believe you failed to answer by shifting the bar to just saying: 'Well, if they feel like non-binary, how can we say it is not the case?'. I go more in detail. I don't think there is any doubt that gender, like everything outside abstract thinking, is non-binary. Even for the bits of the computer the binary representation is just an approximation of an analogical state. There is clearly, even in our hardcore binary evolutionary nature, someone falling in the middle. Or on the side. The point is to decide, as for the bits of the computer, if the binary representation is a good enough representation for our use, or if we want to change it in favor of analogical one. Personally, if any change is required, I would abolish gender-specific societal characteristics instead of multiplying them. A good example is the pronouns. If there was enough evidence for misuse of pronouns being a problem for enough people, and that this problem would weight more in society with respect to the diffused advantage of using gendered pronouns, I could understand a campaign to slowly remove gender-specific pronouns and moving just to 'it' for things and 'they' for people. The multiplication instead is hardly a proficient strategy.  Not because of traditions or language stability, but for the grammatical role of pronouns. Pronoun, pro-noun, means 'instead of the name'. It is a short part you use to avoid repetition and to make discussion faster when it is clear which is the substituted name. You can indeed always substitute he, she or it for the noun, 'He is blond' -> 'Peter is blond', but often it would become cumbersome 'He lost his book. It is red.' -> 'Peter lost Peter's book. Peter's book is red.' The distinction between it and he/she is useful because it makes communication easier: often, there is someone and something in the scene, and the use of it and he/she helps clarity. If I were to remove the distinction between he and it, to say 'He lost his book. He is red.' would be confusing about what is red, him or the book. The lack of distinction would force me to use more repetitions. Same for the gendered distinction between he and she, as it is often the case that gender is well defined and it helps shortening sentences that involve one man and one woman. If however this is not the case, because for example human interactions are not anymore based on male and female interaction or because we consider that this binary representation of reality is not relevant often enough, or because we think that avoiding people to be unconfortable with their non-binary state is more important than an efficient communication, it is much better to remove gendered pronouns than to multiply it.  Why? Because if we move to an analogical approach to gender, everyone is different. Everyone has their own interpretation of their gender. If everyone has their preferred pronouns, they are useless: everyone already has a unique pro-noun: their noun, i,e. their name. If my pronouns are xyr xim, and you have to ask them to me, isn't it easier to just say 'bobon123' and 'bobon123's'? The pronouns are useful only if they are simple and they work on a vast majority of cases. If they are personal, they are just nicknames. If you are forced to learn and use my preferred nicknames when referring to me, the pronouns have lost their grammatical imperative, they are making communication more cumbersome instead of making it simpler. Like for the bathrooms, instead of multiplying them for each perceived gender let's campaign for unisex pronouns and that's it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Been trying to think things through lately. I never really felt any gender dysphoria before, grow facial hair no problem, but I also did not really have it over long nails that I kept being told were girly. If I have had problems that fit into anything, I think that I have came to realize it more about being see  as odd or deviant, something like that.  Have thought that easiest thing would be just to be manly, I think that I have been reasonably good at it, and I don't think I am seen as that odd when I put on my more masculine voice. But anyone ever come to the realization that they had asked themselves what they would be like as the other gender, like a lot without thinking that meant anything? In high stress situations where it feels like you failed at being your gender, really think things would be better as the other? I looked a lot into feminism, thinking I was doing good in looking out for a group I am not part of, but kind of realize that my feelings are as outside perspective as they should.  I know this sounds really dumb, but facing a sort of dysphoria in games where I never really felt comfortable in making my male avatars in games really masculine, but having a sort of awakening that I could do so with a female character. Maybe that sounds disrespectful to those who have faced gender dysphoria,  where they don't feel comfortable in their skin, I have been fascinated by it, and sympathise. But, I have put a lot of introspection into it, I think that I might not be so suseptical to it. Let me explain.  I am not exactly a super masculine guy, I feel comfortable as my dorky self. But I think I sort of realized that I have been looking at tomboys, and feel a kinship that I thought was just attraction, but starting of thinking there is more. I know people maybe have that fetish without really thinking that they have the bits of the gender they are attracted to, but would probably actually feel really wrong is they were suddenly in said position, and I have given it quite a lot of thought, and I think I might not be as affected. Again I feel comfortable now, I understand the concept of feeling like a gender, I am not aching to crossdress, but that awakening feels like a part of me I have always burried.  I know that sounds like some sort of sexual deviant thing, where the person shows colours of being some sort of pervert, it was what I believed for so long, that the idea of being a non-binary person looks so special snowflake attention grabbing. Like a person is perhaps trying to get off on themselves or attract attention, and as who I am I should be against that. So why does it feel like a woman has awoken in me, and it does not feel like she is something deviant? I know of the concept you  could tell a guy to feel their inner woman to empathize with them, but this does not feel like that. She is like a part of me, that is a core part.  I have laughed at the attack helicopter meme, and the idea of trying to stick out as some third gender makes me cringe. But over the time something started actually feel offensive about the idea of equating something ridiculous to not being just male or female. I am a he, I am happy with that, and I want to stick to the clothes I think that I will look good in, so why is this even bothering me? Why was I strangely happy when I heard a certain baby outfit I wore was dress like? Why have I always felt proud as being a Virgo, something feminine? Why happy find that my name could be used for either gender? Why happy over my nails called pretty? What do I hope to get out of asking this?  Sure I think that I had some anxiety of being found in the places only girls should go. Afraid of even taking part in the things designated for women. And it feels like that was out of fear of being called a pervert, yet partially an earnest thought that if I let my guard down I might accidentally find myself going there, and not to perve. Maybe these are all perfectly normal thoughts of an otherwise normal straight male. I don't know. I think that I have practically kept these feeling burried my entire life. It feels like some parts of me are a boy (most), but other parts are a girl. Does this mean I am non-binary?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You're doing a lot of good for the LGBT community by being this rational and articulate and open-minded. I don't know if you're serious about philosophy and philosophers being useless but it's pretty clear to me that you actually benefited a ton from such education, and with you transgender and feminist communities as well, who usually clearly don't shine by their ability to face reality and their intellectual honesty/rigor.   I'm happy I discovered this channel, you made a lot of good points that I hadn't really considered because I don't really have any particular reason to be specifically interested by trans and gays and stuff, and I'm just more and more getting annoyed with all these 'identity politics' that LGBT lobbies are strongly associated with, as I'm convinced the key to a more harmonious and efficient society organization is eventually just tolerance and giving the same rights to everybody while highlighting the common interests that they're all pursuing rather than labeling communities and organizing their struggle and competition.   I don't feel that hostile communitarianism that seems so indissociable from political movements that fight for 'minorities' rights in your videos, or not a lot of it at all, even towards fascists that you yet decided to call out and confront.

"Ok, first things first. It is obvious that gender identity doesn't map one-to-one with biological sex. That's a given, unless you're Ben Shapiro. But saying that it doesn't map on-to-one with biological sex is different from saying that the two are entirely unrelated and they have nothing to do with one another. That's just historically and linguistically false... or is it just a coincidence that 99% biological females identify as females and 99% biological males identify as males?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Of course gender relates to biological sex, which is binary... But ok, I'm eager to accept the idea that, despite an incredibly strong tendency of gender identity and biological sex to overlap, they are indeed apples and oranges and they are not related in any meaningful way. And I might even go out of my way and accept that there are like three, four or fourteen genders out there.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Ok.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"And what would that mean, exactly? What IS gender, anyway? I was used to understand gender as a cultural construct based on attributes of masculinity and femininity, i.e. as a binary system by definition. It is born as a binary system, based on a binary biological classification, built in order to define a binary system of roles... yeah, yeah, I guess you can change that, too; after all it's just word and its meaning can change.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"So, ok, let's go for it, let's change gender from a binary system to a quaternary system or whatever. But when you change the meaning of a word to such an extent that it has no relationship with its original purpose you have to deal with the fact that people are already accustomed to a certain frame of meaning and you will have to expect some resistence, not because they are stupid conservatives but because you are asking a big change in their customs and in their way to perceive and cathegorize things.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"But this is not the true problem, either. The true problem is that this new way to understand gender is utterly useless. The point of a binary classification system is: you sacrifice detailed descriptions of particular entities for the sake of manageability in terms of classes. That's the point of all our modeling of reality, that's the point of language itself: you classify things in a small number of cathegories so that they become manageable. Male and female: two classes, two words conveying some meaningful information about their memers (at the very least, what they look like). Genders are manageable because they are two and no more, you can't have fourteen genders, and not because it would be a crime against nature, but because fourteen genders fail to make things manageable. Ok, you can think of taking binarism away from gender... but you'll find out there's nothing left to it afterwards.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Just think of it for a moment: I have this gender classification that has no roots in biology. This means that not only I can't use it to tell if the other person is, e.g., fit for a certain job, but neither if they have a penis or a vagina, id est if they are a potential sexual partner. I feel the overwhelming uselessness of this gender classification already. And not only that: I also have to learn fourteen of these useless genders. And possibly fourteen pronouns, too.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This won't become mainstream, ever, not because people are conservatives, but just because they are practical, and more than two genders are not practical. Personally, I won't use non-binary language in my speech because it's just impractical. And I really don't see the point of using it. All of the non-binary people I met are just... well... let's keep it short: there's no way you could tell them apart from a cis person if they didn't tell you they are non-binary, except for the fact that some of them dress in a unconventional way. At this point I really don't understand what they mean when they use the word 'gender', but most importantly... whatever it means to them I don't see how this affects society in any meaningful way, so much so that we need new pronouns for their condition. I mean, I see the relevance of being transgender; I see the relevance of being gay... but what's the relevance of being non-binary? Why would I use 'ze' to refere to a biological male who acts 'manly' 99% of the time, who dates biological females, who has a full beard and a full functional penis and sometimes wears a skirt? What does the 'ze' tell about that person that 'he' and 'she' could not convey? That he... sorry, ze wears a skirt from times to times? We need a new word for cis males who wear skirts sometimes?

"As a self-identified mayonaisse I wanna come in late and share my cents, which should be easy to take in if you're anti-SJW.  There are 2 genders. Yup. 2 biological genders if we're talking in sense of the mammal procreating meatbags we all are. All species strive for the survival of their species and the creating and sheltering of offspring is all that matters in that sense. But then again we are sentient beings and we created a thing called society with the goal of transcending our strict biological sense of living. With the transcendence comes individuality which we use to recreate ourself and our identity. And this happens to all of us, whether if we're cis binaries or not. What is masculine and feminine has changed with society for all history since we're more than just penises and vaginas hunting for food and making offspring. And in that sense it's completely logical and rational that there are more than two genders, since they're just products of our induviduality anyway. Society just dictates the norm.

"It's not that I care about 'proper English', it's more about 'they' pronouns being confusing because of our conditioning. I have a non binary friend, and our mutual friends all respect their gender identity, but because this person presents pretty masculine and is essentially a gay man other than their self described preference for they pronouns, it often feels counterintuitive and difficult to discuss this person without just using their name. They pronouns start to fall apart when you are forced to use nothing but 'they' especially when talking about multiple people. 'Who's they? OHHH theeeey.'  I think respect is great, but I think there's more to the conversation than ending it at 'if they want to be called they, that's valid and that's it'.  This particular person actually wants to abolish gender pronouns altogether and just call everyone 'they' until proven otherwise. It really just starts to feel like society as a whole is expected to bend to the gender confusion or uncomfortable feelings a small minority has around gender.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Hello, I am a cis, gay man. I used to identify with non-binary gender identities before coming across information that made most of them seem.. entirely made up? Let me explain.  Most genders, agreeably, make little to any sense. Such as genders such as 'mascgirl' which directly defines a tomboy.   Others such as 'genderfluid' (of which I used to relate) are the fluctuation of masculinity and femininity. Which happens to everyone anyway. Everyone feels less masculine sometimes or more masculine at other times.  Do not get me wrong, I do believe there are three genders (M, F, and X) and outside of that simple spectrum I don't believe there is anything else. Other things are the exceptions, people with slight discourse in the brain that make them slightly different. Though this isn't inherently wrong we shouldn't redefine everything we know because of it.  If you have gender dysphoria, you're trans. Otherwise, no. You can have gender dysphoria which makes you uncomfortable being either gender (WHICH IS ENTIRELY VALID) but you are no other gender than non binary. Thats it.

"I know I am late in posting this comment ( I must be insane to even consider it ). I am biologically male and I am a practicing Witch/Shaman/Druid depending on what Goddess I worship. I am called an Enaria ( womanly-man ). The third gender as a concept has always been around, we were shamans, witches, priests/priestess, sacred prostitutes, generals, courtiers, advisers to great empires. The third gender is not devoid of gender but the combination of both the masculine and feminine. The great goddess Agdistis is both god and goddess and was castrated by Dionysis by Zeus' command for he feared hir power. Every ancient society had a concept of the third gender we were considered sacred because of our abilities. The third gender includes eunuchs, feminine-men/masculine-woman and transsexuals. In Mongolia before the rise of Buddihsm their shamans used to look for boys and girls that did not take part in their gender stricthres I.e. they took the manly girl and raised her with the men and she would take a wife, the boy was raised with the women and took part in their activities and took a husband and become shamans. They did this when the children started puberty 10-12. In my opinion the only way you could accept that you are the the third gender is that you become a pagan witch if not you will always feel incomplete and can not fully unlocked your potential. It is apart of us embrace and end this non-binary 50 gender words and promoting farce. The terms and pronouns are already here if you pull your fingire out and become a witch. I do not have gender dysphoria but I know I am not fully male I live as a female with by boyfriend and help raise his children I'm 23 and he is 40.......I'm a cliche I know, I know I am not female but biologically male but through my witchceaft and shamanasm I've became both. I hope that clears it up or even add more confusion I do so enjoy it.............I worship Isis/Iset, Hekate-Erashkigal, The Morrighan.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"so basically all the nonbinary discourse is based on believing some chosen people can feel the 'essence' of being women, men or in between? And as you cited Wittgenstein, and the social use of a word is what is important, then what is the meaning of the genderhoods? you have a mentioned that what 's important is the person's perception of themself but when someone expresses their identity of course they use words, so is always conditioned by the social discourse. As any meaning of woman/manhood outside the traditionals (physical expressions, poetic  traditional archetypes, certain traits of personality, etc) usually are tautologycal (e.g woman are people who feel like woman) Is there any point to have this separation of gender and not just try to abolish it altogether? or is queer theory etc just a step into that ultimate goal? sorry if I sound too argumentative, I love this channel and I'd be willing to learn and hear experiencies from people, etc. thanks if someone takes the time to read this and help me with the topic and sorry If I don't use the english quite right, not my first language and learning","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As I said in your genderqueer video, a valid reason to dislike the non binary stuff is that it implies that there are people comfortable with gender. If you belive that gender is an imposition made to people, then it is very possible that very few people are happy with it. Specially girls, because they are being opressed by it, but also boys, cause it is hard to follow all these little rules that your gender imposes to you. 'Nobody conforms to gender roles, because they are made up. They are not real'.   But the real issue that those terms create is the fact that most of the so-called non-binary folks are females (as you said yourself) with internalized misoginy trying to escape self-hate by stop calling themselves women. And this is cruel. They should be told that it is possible to be female and not face misoginy.  A more serious thing is the legislation that has been pushed or the education that is being spred by those people. Saying that we should eliminate the word vagina, that any man who self declare woman should have access to woman-only spaces, that you are a bigot for having sexual preferences for genitalias, which is homophobic. That women who knows about their own biology needs to be vilified as an evil witch, etc.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Regarding the whole cloudgender, alphabetgender thing, I just get confused as to what they mean. Like is your gender _like_ a cloud, like if it were a tangible thing it would be whispy/thick and humid? Or do you identify as a cloud? If it's the first, I'm a slut for metaphors and symbolism so hell yeah, you go be your cloudgender self! If it's the second, I think you're getting genders confused with kintypes. You know those people who say that they feel like their soul is a fox, or was a fox, so they feel deeply connected to that spiritual ancestry and may even have body dysphoria when it comes to stuff like not having longer ears, fur, or a tail? Those people are foxkin. If you have a deep personal connection with clouds or feel like you once were or should have been a cloud (and not a human), you're probably cloudkin, not cloudgender.  Then again my gender's definition seems to evade reasonable definition too. I'm not quite genderfluid because I don't fully flow between masculine, feminine, third gender, etc.. It also changes depending on my environment, but not always, and not always in the same way every time. I don't understand it. I guess the best word is just genderqueer, but I feel like the best way to describe it is probably in the language that Cthulhu speaks, which drives humans insane to even listen to it being spoken, so idk man.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"My own hot take on the invalidity of non-binary gender roles: my take is fairly similar to the 3rd opinion, that non-binary gender seems to be the solution to a problem that didnt exist, that of gender non-conformity. Nobody is completely gender conforming. It's not as though a person who identifies male is in his garage all day grunting and masturbating and fixing cars and lifting weights, and if you neither conform or aspire to this archetype then you are not masculine; in fact to claim this is only to calcify gender roles. Put more plonky, Gender does not work in this hardlined way of 'girls wear makeup, I don't like makeup and I do like sport and dirt and therefore I'm not a girl' as opposed to just seeing yourself as a girl who doesn't like makeup and likes sports and dirt. and if you use any line of thought similar to this, you're basically saying that THE ONLY people who wear makeup are girls, and to be a girl you MUST wear makeup. So it is when you use your distance from ANY gender norm as a justification for your dysphoria. You're evaluating your gender as relative to other people as opposed to simply expressing your inner self. Nobody is this pure hegemonic male or female. They're mythic. Hegemonic masculinity and femininity are sort of cultural myths; they are aesthetic and aspirational in nature.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm very impressed by your channel. I come from listening to a lot of the 'skeptics' like Sargon of Akkad, Armoured Skeptic, Amazing Atheist and all those other shits. You have an interesting perspective that keeps me coming back.  Frankly, when it comes to gender, non-binary or otherwise, I care not for any of it. As you mentioned, gender was quite useful at one time. It was useful to know who was a man and who was a woman because that was relevant to and largely dictated what a person was both capable of and expected to do within that society. But now that we're kinda tossing gender roles down the garbage, I say we just throw the whole gender thing out therewith. Fuck whoever you want, dress how you want, I don't give a damn.  And when it comes to pronouns I don't care either. All I care about is knowing who the fuck we're all talking about. I'm a man, I have a dick but I don't care if people call me he or she or they or hir or whatever. All that matters to me is that we know who we're talking about. I don't let people dictate what I can call them in the third person because that's just absurd. If someone else can ask that then so can I, irrelevant of why, as that is the essence of fairness.

"I come from a military town in so cal, and a man was just murdered in training. The only motive anyone can establish is that the perpetrator must have found out that his fellow service member was a homosexual.  The perpetrator claimed his sights were off, but forensics determined he was only 10 feet away from the man when the gun went off.  The victim was shot in the middle of the back, through the lungs. It supposedly took minutes for him to finally die. No one found his body until the training excersize was over.  These times are trying.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I know I'm 2 years late, but I'm currently figuring out that I don't fit so snug into the male/female binary. This video was EXTREMELY comforting, after fighting to just be believed that I exist on reddit (and trying to convince my brother that nonbinary people exist. secretly. from my very female body.)     I hope it stops being a joke soon. You know that 'The Toys that Made us' series on Netflix? I cried almost every episode, because the toys are so heavily gendered and I just couldn't understand identifying with the Barbie episode especially. Toys that were made for girls, that were so successful among girls, that utterly disinterested me, and making me realize that being female felt fundamentally wrong. Legos were my jam. Not GI joe or My Little Pony... but even Legos were gendered male in a lot of places (and there was a pink set or something for girls, implying the other sets before weren't made with girls in mind? I don't know. More tears of confusion.)    I've started to feel a strange visceral reaction of disgust and upset when referred to as part of a group of 'ladies'. Like, 'But that's not right at all, why would you say that'. It's intense and I keep it to myself because how do you tell someone 'Actually, I'm not a lady, but also, I'm not a man either'. That makes the language harder. 'Oh I'm sorry. Ladies and also a creature of the everlasting void.'    It's like I don't want to harass people with my confusing existence. It's not easy to explain to most people.    The things that help me accept myself: Peridot from Steven Universe. Other NB people existing. Animals (my cat don't gaf if I'm acting/dressing against my sex, and I like biology and know about a lot of sex-swapping and gender twisting animals, like the clown fish or the hyena). And this video. It's not a long list, but I expect it to grow in the future :)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Listen here you nebulous question template representing no single person in particular but more of the general feelings of the majority of humanity as a whole towards non-binary people:  Kids won't have any trouble understanding your mayonnaise gender. Trust me on this, I swear to Jebus in heaven as your sister in Christ, kids don't give a shit unless they're specifically taught to give a shit. The thing is, if you explain something about identity to a child they'll have three possible responses: 'Oh, okay', 'Why?', or 'That's dumb.' If you get the first response, don't even worry about the whole issue until they come back in a week and ask you why their friend hates mayonnaise people. If you get the second response, that's your cue to tell them that's just what that person likes. If you get the third response, it means -your child has been corrupted by The Dark One and must be offered to Mother Sarkeesian a- I mean, it probably means you were too late and the child has probably been around another child raised by right-wing parents who told them that non-binary people are evil. Fuck knows how to deal with that, because if you rebut them in any way, they'll probably just get mad and say you're dumb. Maybe ask them why they think it's any of their business in the first place, and explain that they have no idea how that person feels so it's strange for them to make judgements?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Gender non-binary is not an issue most people think about until it's being forced upon. I think that's where people's issues lie. For the majority of people it's new, seems to have happened very quickly, there is confusion and then added to that we see anger from gender non-binary people. There needs to be more understanding for gender non-binary people and what they're going through and likewise there should be more understanding from gender non-binary people to why the majority of people are confused, scared, worried etc. Things take time don't they?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i think the average layman's argument against it would be more fundamentally against the idea that gender identity even exists. most people see it as 1) sex and 2) social roles, and any feelings that a trans person or gender nonconforming person might experience are just responses to their experienced sex and social roles. before i realized i was trans i would have said the same thing you did, i don't feel like a man or a woman. i would have called the idea that there's any certain way that men or women feel sexist, too. what i was missing was what that question really means is, how do you feel ABOUT being a woman? and how would you feel about being a man? and if my response is that i would feel better if i were male, that makes me a trans man.  so if that's the conceptualization that people have of what being trans entails, nonbinary genders don't make sense because there is no way to BE neither male nor female, or a third sex, or fluid between them, so how is one supposed to think about how they would respond to that? however, there are ways to transition to agender/neutrois or a mix of sex traits, but few people realize this. that basically sums up the divide between tucutes and truscum in trans discourse, too. tucutes believe that gender identity exists seperate of and NOT necessarily in response to biological sex, and truscum believe you are only able to experience a sense of gender identity in relation to concrete experiences of dysphoria or lack of. i don't know what i believe, possibly some sort of middle ground, but i think this is where most people get lost when trying to understand nonbinary identities.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Ok here's a thing: I really like your humour and all, but I think there is a big misunderstanding here. I think most people don't have any problem with how you dress or what you identify with. Most people have a problem with oversensitivity and guilt-tripping for things they are individually not responsible for. For instance, I understand it can be very frustrating for even a very deep-voiced woman to be called sir on the phone, but almost everyone has some awkward aspect of their life which constantly leads to uncomfortable situations. I. e.  my brother died when I was 13 and for most people it is a completely normal question to ask if I have siblings. Then I always have an awkward moment when I feel the need to explain my brother died, because I like to make things clear right in the beginning of getting to know someone. I can simply say no, but I feel that doesn't explain who I am, I would have to avoid sharing stories about my childhood etc. If I say yes on the other hand that feels just 'too much of personal information' and creates an awkward atmosphere. Throughout the years I have come to accepting this situation and I finally know how to say it smoothly while quickly lifting up the unease of the situation. I feel I've grown socially because of this inconvenience and I also think it has helped me process my trauma of losing a brother. It taught me how to reconnect with society. I'm also left-handed and I think it is amazing people don't hit on children's hands anymore and you can even buy products made for the left-handed, but I won't force society to give me a handshake with a left hand, solely because I'm left-handed. I understand that cooperation requires compromise of every single person on this planet as no one shares the same individual story. I also understand if transgender people would feel upset if people are comparing their 'traumas' of not being called by the right pronoun to the traumas they have to go through wanting to commit suicide, people calling them trannies, raping them in the public bathroom. I understand if they are upset as they also go through being accidentally misidentified as the opposite sex and if someone they know that it is really only the tip of the iceberg they have to go through and they would happily tolerate these tiny things and they see it very clearly how society is growing skeptical towards them because nowadays those people who shout the loudest for tolerance are the same ones who are unable to tolerate the slightest honest mistakes of others.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Labels are good only as long as they actually tell you something. If there  are too many describing too similar things they lose their explanatory power because information needs to be somewhat compressed to be useful.   The term 'non-binary' itself implies that everyone else is binary and the same, but that's not the case unless you think everyone is non-binary, but then the term is meaningless.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think the real problem lies with who gets to define what gender is. Where do we draw the line(s) in between ? Because if everyone gets to choose their gender then we could have 7 billion genders. And that's not gender which is defined by classical masculine and feminine traits. It completely ignores the biological reasons for differences between the sexes. Gender becomes an emotional state instead of a somewhat clear defined category. It's simply not correct and therefore I disagree. Secondly (and believe this is what pisses people off) certain small groups claim to be this or that made up gender and pretend to take offense to it when others don't acknowledge their fantasies. This becomes really problematic once these minority groups reach for legislative power and try to force others by law to accept their beliefs as reality. That is tyranny and a society in which I don't believe any of us want to live.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Honestly the biggest problem I have is ballooning terminology. Language would lose some effectiveness as a tool if meaning became difficult to convey due to far too many terms with far too granular differences. Mostly though, this is just a problem with the fact that these terms are in early stages. Most of the terms that are too specific will die off through lack of use and recognition, and the surviving terms will probably get grouped under at most a couple of umbrella terms. Most people will only really understand the umbrella terms, and though the more granular terms will matter to the people inside said umbrellas, they'll just tell everyone else which umbrella they're under. The only thing that I'm outright against in this whole scene is the creation of new pronouns. It's completely superfluous, needlessly cumbersome, and nobody's been able to come up with any good ones.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think the real issue lies in the definition of gender. Most people view gender has inherently linked to sex, therefore they say there are only 2 of them (there are 2 sexes, intersex is a defect, not the rule). To these people gender doesn't mean much, it's just a concept linked to biology. On the other hand, non-binary people think of gender as a social concept that is linked to gender roles and personality. Even in the examples from different cultures they give you can tell that the third or fourth genders correspond to a different role in society.   So the first thing we should do is decide which definition of gender prevails.   Personally, I think most non-binary in the west are full of shit. I hear you but I have yet to come across a non-binary that is older than 30 y/o and doesn't have a tumblr account. I've heard a few ex non-binary people saying that they realized they were just confused about the whole topic. I believe the vast majority of people who revendicate all this no-binary stuff are as well and will grow out of it. They are certainly people who are really non-binary but they don't give a fuck and live their lives without inventing millions of labels for themselves.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I empathize with people who say that it's 'not grammatical English' because wordclasses like prepositions and pronouns are 'closed classes,' meaning we have a rather rigid paradigm and we don't like to change it.  Just look at how many people still object to singular 'they.'  That's not even a new word; many just don't like a change in usage.  But all that being said, the key is to be aware of this issue and then find a way around it, not to use it as an excuse to deny people their identity.  Now, I'm not saying people should be able to just say, 'My preferred pronoun is flarg,' because that kind of defeats the purpose of a pronoun, but I do think it would be worthwhile for academics in the study of English to settle on a single, non-gendered, animate pronoun, with public input, of course.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Okay, I'm no scholar, but here's my two cents regarding gendered pronouns. I find it stupidly redundant, and I think we'd be better off without it. Like, take the sentence, 'The stewardess told me she'd be back shortly'. What information is in this sentence? Well, the stewardess is leaving, and the stewardess will return very soon... also she's a woman. That last bit is important for what reason exactly? This is completely unnecessary, there are plenty of languages that do just fine without it, and trying to expand on this broken mess to accommodate for non-binary genders seems rather ham-handed. That's a solution that doesn't address the problem, the problem being that 'he' and 'she' mean masculine and feminine, and all the roles and expectations associated with that; adding to the list won't fix that. What I think we should be doing is making our language (and basically our culture as a whole) *less* gender-centric, not more.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

In principle, everyone is non-binary, so goes the argument: what is the point in having a special word for it?  I say this as someone who has been questioning my gender for over a year now. I keep thinking I am different from my birth-assigned gender because I don't strongly identify as a man. But then again I am reminded that most cis men I know feel the same (or very similar) about it.  There must be some kind of line drawn between binary and non-binary identities.

"Funny enough, you say you're not non-binary, but this 'The whole gender thing doesn't make sense to me, I don't identify as ANY gender at all!' sentiment is EXACTLY what a ton of non-binary people say they experience too. It's also known, somewhat facetiously, as wtfgender (among other things). And the 'I don't care what kind of body I have, I could LITERALLY wake up in a body with different genitals etc. tomorrow and wouldn't give a shit' thing is known as 'cis by default', which can be thought of as a type of demigender or perhaps multigender or agender.  In fact initially I thought you were a trans woman. That said, Zinnia Jones started out as a YouTube personality discussing atheism, gender and other topics while playing around with gender expression and not firmly committing to any gender, too, much like you, so it kind of makes sense to think this. Also, don't you say in that other video in the sidebar that you're genderqueer? Genderqueer is understood to be pretty much the same as non-binary these days.  EDIT: Ah, I see now you hadn't come out as genderqueer/non-binary at the time of this video, but have in the newer one.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

As you said in your video about Freedom of Speech, there have to be some restrictions and boundaries, otherwise everything falls apart. From where I sit, if anyone can claim to be any sort of non-binary gender and we aren't allowed to be skeptical about it, then it undermines the entire concept of gender and renders all of them - man/woman and all the new ones - completely useless as a way to categorize people.

Your sex is determined by your genitalia, chromones, and hormones. So, technically, transgender people are still the gender they are born as because you can't change your chromones.  But we call them the gender they identify as to be polite. I'm the same way with  gender queer people. You are technically the gender you're born as.

"'There isn't a gay gene so no biological basis for homosexuality'.  There is a bad idea for the theory for a biological basis for homosexuality in nature. For instance, (according to Dr. Lawrence Karuss) 10% of male sheep wind up in long term monogamous homosexual  relationships. And before everyone gets triggered I am not saying gay people are sheep shaggers!  (Being from England's West Somerset region I am well aware of the habit,  never having partaken of that myself!) In the case identical twins research shows if one twin is homosexual the other twin is more likely to be promiscuous. The connection is not clear yet but there is one there somewhere! Ending on a serious not if anyone is interested in a more balanced in depth look at this whole gender snarl - up I can recommend the video's of Dr. Jordan B Peterson professor of psychology at university of Toronto. As he is a personality psychologist with a thriving practice as well as teaching, his view of gender is particularly worth checking out. And my gender identity? I identify as a fairy. I consider myself to be faced with discrimination if you don't agree with me that I gave a patriot fairy wings sticking out of my back inbetween my shoulder blades!  In other words you can have as many gender identities as you want if any shape or form but you have no business telling me I have to go along with your views on gender identity.

So, if I told you I'm an attack helicopter, you wouldn't challenge that idea?   Look, CP, most folks on the 'anti-SJW' side of the debate don't want to just shit on people for being different. They just want scientific fact and logic to remain the staple of which human interaction occurs. There are only two genders. You can be more masculine, feminine, or androgenous, but there are only two genders. We will not cede science for comfortability, we do not like religion.   Like with any ideology or movement, there are assholes, and we have our fair share. There are xenophobes, racists, sexists, homophobes, transphobes, etc. in the anti-SJW movement. There are also the same people in the SJW/feminist movement.  The majority of people just want to stop pandering to, and treating minorities with extra and special rights, we all are equals. And most of us, if asked nicely, will even try to use some ridiculous pronoun other than the he/she pronouns.

"I think even if someone understands the basic principles of the way language works, there are still definitely reasons why they don't wish to use pronouns like 'they.'  I'd say the biggest one is that it's a way of 'giving in' or in some way or another showing support. Whether that's actually true or not in a less subjective sense is a question, but regardless it certainly feels that way. Say you're a transphobe who believes that trans people are wrong and you meet a trans woman. You fully believe in your heart that she is a man and not a woman. To show this to the outside world you call her a 'he.' It's a proof of opposition. But say your really good friend comes out as non binary and tells you to call them 'they.' You care about this person and you want them to be happy, and feel respected. By calling them something other than 'they' there's a good chance it won't make them feel that way at all, but you don't want to signal that you think non binary identities are valid. You support them but not their identity. So what do you do? I think if you want to make someone feel good, who cares? Put your beliefs aside, you don't have to be so determined in them that they interfere with your functioning socially. Talk however you want, but in the end, don't let your strength in beliefs to turn you into an asshole.

"Great video. It is amazing how many of the supposed arguments people make boil down to that first one: it's new/different and therefore wrong. People seem to think it's enough to say that binary trans identities are acceptable but NB genders 'go too far', as if something being more different/unusual is enough to say that it's wrong.  The only argument I have heard that is sort of reasonable (even if it's not my opinion) is the idea that feminism means that people should be able to adhere to whatever gender roles they want without having to change their gender identity. My main counter point to that argument is that (obviously) people shouldn't have to identify as NB just because they don't fit in traditional gender roles. If they are comfortable with their binary gender identity then the newly defined terms aren't useful for them. Rather the terms are for the people who, for whatever reason, feel more comfortable/authentic using a NB identity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As far as the whole 'I won't believe the validity of nonbinary people until the scientific evidence backs it up,' I'm in that camp for the same reason I'm an atheist; because I see no good reason to consider all genders as valid as male, female, and intersex. I'm always open to learning about new things, and if the scientific consensus goes in favor of nonbinary people existing, I'll consider that valid. It also goes without saying that I use peoples pronouns and names, that's just being a reasonable person. I just need a really good reason if I'm going to believe something outside of what the current medical and scientific literature has recognized as true. Maybe I'll be waiting in the purgatory of no-definite-answer for a while, but listening to screeching blue haired morons doesn't cut it for me.

"I always thought that stuff is confusing because in german, we don't have a word for 'gender', just 'sex'. You are female with XX Chromosomes and male with XY, anything besides that is a mutation, often accompanied with health problems. The Biological Sex does have a bearing on our behavior, because brain structure and hormones are different in men and women. Culture is basically steroids to our tendencies.  I don't get why people Focus that much on their gender. Someone can express themselves however they want, I'll even go along without to a certain extend.   But, if its inconvenient, which much of this PC-Language is in german the german language, our sentences and words are long and complicated enough already, without the *innen (which I never know how to pronounce, shall I pause at the * or say it straight. Not pausing excludes the other sex (in this case just the male one) again, but pausing makes me sound stupid) or sie*er, sif/sis/sim/sin, dif/dis/dim/din, sier/sies/siem/sien or whatever, I won't speak like that.  Or , if its science-denying, saying the 'gender' as it is, being introduced by your Chromosomes, Brain-structure, Hormones *and* Society, is completely imaginary, I won't go with *that* either.

"'I don't think non binary people need to provide any arguments in support of their own existence.....because I believe in freedom' Now you bring humour into your discussion from time to time so I wasn't sure whether or not to argue against this in case you were being satire. But in case you aren't being satire I will. Requesting an argument for 'non binary people' wouldn't be an advocacy against freedom. If you were to say 'if you don't have an argument then you shouldn't have any freedoms' then yes that would be a horrible thing and it would go against basic human rights but looking for a biological explanation isn't a request for the removal of their freedom. 'It's new and different and I don't like it' 'the vast majority of people I see objecting to non-binary identities are people who are basically just repulsed by something that new and different and ridiculous to them' The people you've witnessed argue against it need to be criticized for merely going against something just because it is 'new'. I usually witness different statements. Ones I quite often agree with. Like the fact that phrase 'non-binary genders' is an oxymoron. Binary is defined as 'relating to, composed of, or involving two thing' if there is more than 2 genders then gender in its entirety is non-binary hence the phrase 'non-binary2 would be redundant. How could it have a binary and a non binary element to it. If there's 76 genders then that there isn't two genders hence gender wouldn't be binary. 'And if somebody tells me if they alternate between 3 different gender identities my initial response is to say really, that's interesting, tell me more'   'Being transgender is an actual medical diagnosis' it means you've been diagnosed with gender dysphoria which is basically an extreme discontent with ones own gender'   I'm going to address both Blaire and you as I disagree with both of you. She was wrong on saying being transgender is a medical diagnosis. It's gender dysphoria that a medical diagnosis. Gender dysphoria is not synonymous with being transgender. But there is biological explanations given to being trans.  Since 1995 there has been studies done on the brain structures of those who classify themselves as trans. They've come to a multitude of discoveries. In a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, trans people had their brains wired in these regions similar to the gender they identified with. Meaning mtf had their wired similar to cisgender women and vice versa with ftm. This opposite sex wiring also occurs in an area of the brain known as the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus, part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. 'Brain-based research has repeatedly shown that female-to-male transsexuals have several male-like characteristics in neuroanatomy' 'white matter pattern in female-to-male transsexuals was shifted in the direction of biological males' this can all be read in the brain structure section on this Wikipedia page URL '5 seconds ago homosexuality was an actual medical diagnosis' 'There's probably no gay gene but there's definitely gay people and we didn't need brain scans to figure that out' I agree with you on the gay gene. But there is a biological element to homosexuality. Female brains are shaped symmetrically whilst male brains are shaped asymmetrically. From looking at brain scans gay men posses female shaped brains (symmetrical) whilst lesbian posse's male shaped brains (asymetrical) The amygdale of gay men is also the same size as a woman's and vice versa with lesbians and straight men URL URL You might be asking why this is. Fingers are usually pointed at hormone levels during the development of a fetus. An excess amount oestrogen inflicted on a male fetus might result in same-sex attraction as the result of the feminization of many aspects of its brain. If there's an even greater production of female hormones or if happens during the development of different parts of the brain it can result in transexuality.  URL  Now I'm going to go back to your statement on not caring if people alternate between 3 different gender identities. The thing is that it wouldn't make any sense. How could ones neurological wiring shift from one end to the other? I remember one description of someone saying that they were shopping in the mens section but then they put down their shopping bags and walked over to the other side of the store. Brain wiring in terms of gender can shift to an extent. (in postnatal terms) It can't shift from one polar end to the other and in instances where it does shift the change is very nuanced and its the result of long term exposure to hormones so it cant shift within seconds. This would give zero biological legitimacy to many 'non-binary genders'  I personally do care about those who classify themselves as trans when their identities have no evidence to support it. I would not mistreat them but I would merely give criticism towards their beliefs similar to astrologists. 'Physciatrists make shit up as they go just as much as anyone and they invent knew words to describe new conditions all the time'  When it came to the classification of homosexuality as a mental disorder it occurred as the result of the analysis of their behaviour. That behaviour being not conforming to what is expected of a male or a female in a mental sense as the possessed a sexual desire for the same sex. It seemed to go against what nature intends or what is expected of someone. But as we know now, classifying a gay man as mentally ill would be the same as calling a straight women mentally ill since what results in a gay man finding men attractive is having parts of the brain that are responsible for sexual desire being feminized. They both share that same characteristic. It started off as an understandable conclusion but then came to the realisation that it wasn't the correct conclusion. They don't always 'make shit up as they go' there are legitimate mental illnesses lke bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and ptsd. A lot of mental illnesses are accompanied with biological explanations.  No offense but you've given quite a ridiculous comment on an occupation that helps the lives of numerous people who struggle with debilitating mental illnesses.

"What I dont like about the notion of 'non-binary genders' is that it seems to confirm the idea that being a woman/man means conforming to gender roles. For example I think it is much more powerful to say 'I am a man who enjoys makeup' than 'I dont identify as a man because I enjoy makeup'. The latter is basically affirming the male gender role of not wearing makeup instead of fighting it like the former. Isn't that what feminism has been fighting for - to not let your sex define you? Whereas non-binary people seem to be saying it DOES define you, so when they see that their behaviour doesn't fit with the gender roles of their sex, they simply change their identity instead of confronting the gender roles.

"My position on the non-binary thing is still pretty firm. I sat and sifted through that list of genders and it's still bullshit to me. Keep in mind, I'm an effeminate gay man who doesn't conform to the gender expectation of what a man is supposed to be like so I'm not coming from a place of 'Ragglefraggle'. It's just that it's telling to me that so many people who are so for this 'non-binary' thing tend to be of younger age and I can tell just why a good few of them feel the way they do, especially 'Non-binary' men.  Men who deviate from gender expectations of what society demands a man to be has always been harsh and unforgiving. Masculine women may get some mud flung at them but it's no where near the level of what a feminine man gets as we're often described as embarrassments to our gender or defects or any other insult meant to insult an effeminate guy because we're 'revoking' our man card. So naturally, we will be more prone to getting bullied for deviating. What I believe has happened is that ever since Tragenderism became a more open discussion, this opened up the floodgate for non-binary to come into play.   These are people who aren't transgender. They don't feel any gender dysphoria but rather, they like to either A), present themselves as the opposite gender in clothing or B), mix it up together (we had a word for that, it was called androgyny). The big thing I've noticed when reading that list of gender was feeling. 'Feels like', 'Feeling' ,pretty much always 'Feel' was the primary description I saw in those... 'Genders.' And well, I just can't buy it. All I'm seeing are people who may deviate from gender norms but want to justify it some way so they made up all these terms to do just that and in my opinion, it's not needed.   Mainly because I don't believe it's wrong for men to be feminine or women to masculine. It really isn't. To hell with society trying to make those of us who deviate feel like subhumans because we don't conform. You don't need a special 'gender' to make your presentation valid. You can be a feminine male and you can be a masculine female and if you like both, you can be an androgynous male or female.   So really, that's why I don't buy into non-binary genders and I'm not going to be indulging in calling people things like 'Zim', 'Zir', or Zhey', or any other nonsensical phrase that gets spat out of the big old land of Tumblr gender politics. If you're a masculine woman who would prefer to be called 'he', I will call you that and vice versa if you're a feminine man = 'her', but that's only out of politeness and that's really as far as I'm going to personally go lol.  if you want to believe in those genders, you have every right to do that but don't force that stuff on people who really aren't interested or try to push it into law. I will say that if you haven't read the 35-76+ gender list, do it so you know exactly what this list is pushing lol.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I suppose my central objection to this idea is simply that it commits the central sin that so many individualist feminists objected to in the first place, namely that it ties all kinds of bizarre things up in a concept that really has no business being there. The designation 'woman' being incredibly restrictive historically has brought with it a whole bunch of assumptions about the kinds of things one's 'gender' denotes, but if we were happy with the idea of severing all this behaviour stuff from chromosomes then we end up in a situation where all the stuff left over can be shuffled off into its multifarious containers.  If you look at the type of things these gender designations contain, it seems like they commit the sin of categorising something based on a flawed ancestral model; once all the things collected into gender can be unhooked from sex, then we can do what we want with them. Many of these describe self-chosen social roles in specific social contexts, eg butch, and it strikes me that we gain little by calling this a 'gender' rather than just leaving it as the constellation of behaviour that it actually described.  There is also the lurking point of the extent to which you can analyse how seriously you should be taking other people's preferences. The rates of mental illness and violence against transgender people suggest to me that taking their plight seriously and being punctilious in using their chosen pronoun is both worthwhile and can cause harm if not done so. The same is not true (mostly), however, for somebody who decides that they are some neologistic gender which is neither physically apparent nor liable to do them serious harm. So yes, if it's a harmless preference why not - but at the same time, that preference is vastly less important than the transgender case and I very much understand why so many trans people feel slightly put out at it.  Male/Female gender policing is strong, omnipresent and frequently violent. This other stuff? Much less so.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"You know I don't think most people just don't believe in a few genders because it's new and unheard of, in fact I think a lot of the community you often respond to actually just doesn't see it as a third gender (as what I see it as).

There are still two genders, more these identities are valid but almost sub-genders within the main two.

"Thank you for this video.  It is genuinely interesting to see people explore the realm of gender and sexuality, and I think you're brave to do so.  My first thought is that it must feel liberating to be on this journey of self discovery, while simultaneously it must feel as though you are constantly being mocked and made fun of as though you live in an eternal highschool with an endless supply of grandma's hand-knitted sweaters.  Like most people, my main interaction with those of uncommon genders involves videos of public confrontation.  In these videos it's usually someone of trans, non-binary etc gender attacking someone for holding views which disagree with theirs, and comes off rude and obnoxious.  I've never seen a rational video involving people with non-binary or binary trans genders etc.  This is the first one for me, and it is refreshing.  Well done.    If you wouldn't mind indulging me, I have a burning question.  Context:  One thing i've noticed is that those with non-traditional gender identities appear to have a preoccupation with gender identity as a whole, and seem to to build their lives around this identity and talk about it constantly.  I think even my gay friends do this from time to time too, but not to this extent.  It's as though the label is more important than the person.  So the question is:  In the absence of social criticism, would gender identity remain a large part of your life?

"You are hilarious and very entertaining. You also give some strong arguments and present them without the usual drama-filled, over sensitive, cry baby, fluff crap that some (most YouTube) non binary people resort to when trying to help the world understand their point of view. Imagine how wrong it would be for me to jump down non binary people's necks when trying to help them understand what it's like to feel like me, the straight, heterosexual George (pronoun = he), or how offended they would get if my very GAY brother was to jump down a non binary person's throat to try to get them to understand how it feels to be a homosexual man who also identifies with being a man, but who is attracted to men rather than to women (pronoun for HIM = HE). The problem with those who have different identities than what is more socially common or acceptable is that proving their different identity becomes their full time job and life mission. At that moment, they don't worry about growing, getting an education, being kind to people who are different than them, etc. but rather simply want to put the world down for not 'respecting' their gender identity. It is like homosexual men who have to constantly prove their 'gayness' by telling you about the last man they did or did them, and the straight dude who has to show you pictures of the last hottie he 'banged.'

"In your comments about how in modern 'capitalist, individualistic' societies we do not need strict gender definitions, contrasted with agrarian and ancient societies, let me point out that classical duties of sex in agriculture, warfare and child-rearing still exist and have a place even within rural parts, our breadbaskets.  The military still instils within their recruits courage, temperance, and other virtues to make them good soldiers, even if women can now participate, and there are now more applications and career paths one can take; the brawn of the Marines and Army, however, wins wars. And although our farms have become industrialized hitherto, the division of labour between men and women based on sex exists for good purpose too. The complete abolishment of a binary requires the abolishment of the very building mechanisms which led us to this point in history, or at any rate the dilution of their original forms in transfiguration. At this point, I suggest we look beyond the confines of our cities and recognize that traditional distinctions have just as much, if not more validity, than new trends in urban centres.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

While I'm fine with gender identity/expression being more fluid and variable I believe there is value in the traditional ideas of femininity and masculinity. I say this purely because it avoids confusing sexual attraction. I like a society where it is easy to understand who is a biological male or female because it makes it easier to find a partner. It also means that men and women are inclined to present themselves in a way their ideal partner would find attractive, which is basically a convoluted way of saying it's sexier.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Actually, the reason Homosexuality's *'5sec'* diagnosis as a psychological disorder was short, until 1973, wasn't because of evidence that people were born that way, or any other valid reason. It was political coaching by Rockefeller foundation and other significant far left groups in 1972, where it was decided to vote homosexuality out of the list of Mental diseases or abnormal mental conditions.  *1973 at the Annual American Psychiatric Association Convention,* it was voted out NOT through the scientific process that is was not a mental condition, as some misguided people would have you believe, but the reason was because some elitists thought it was a good idea to push a toxic narrative that would further desensitize people and *weaken the country* as a whole. Which is the goal, weaken a nation starting with the people, to break it down, to mold it in order to form a one world Gov.    Ultimately, it wasn't voted out because it was proven otherwise, nor because of sufficient evidence given to dismiss it (Same difference), but because it was politically driven & convenient for the purpose of reducing the population and further distracting the _gullible American masses with social conditioning & disputes over trivial matters, which is LGBT._","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I guess you don't understand the definition of freedom. Of course you're free to do whatever you want. That freedom does not include a mandate that other people validate your choices. That's actually the opposite of freedom.   That's tyranny.  No one is entitled to automatic respect because of some identity they come up with.  I know I speak for many people in saying that respect has to be earned with attitude and behavior.   The vast majority of people could care less about your sexual preference and identity. But you actually start losing respect when you start demanding respect.  No one likes someone with an entitled attitude no matter what their identity.  Your existence should be validated by you and you alone.

People should (of course) have the freedom to identify and express themselves however they see fit, and when first hearing about non-binary gender I was interested due my reading of Plato's 'Symposium' as an impressionable kid. Rather than expanding the definitions of male and female though, there seems to be an ever growing number of genders created for those who don't feel traditionally male or female: to me this is counterintuitive. Conflating non-binaries with transgenders is also a problem, particularly legally, as non-binary pronouns aren't a natural part of (non-plural) speech and forcing any speech seems frankly Orwellian.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Lets concede that a lot of this controversy is just people digging their heels in.    That being said I don't think this current iteration of gender identity has any real merit to it.  Arguing that the current binary model is too restrictive and needs an update is all well and good however the mark of any good updated model is that it explains everything that the previous model explained while explaining more.  The current update fails at the first hurdle.     Take reproduction for example ; we know that if a male has sex with a female a baby happens however if a man has sex with a man then there is no baby.  Now what happens when an agender has sex with a genderblender?     If you are going to expand the number of factors then make sure they slot into the existing frame work.  For example I might be a MXYS, a male with XY chromosomes who is straight.  Expand to your hearts desire however do the work, have a structure, ideally your should provide a metric that allows interested  parties to measure distance from one gender to another.  Until that time I will be as interested in your non-binary spectrum as I am when my 10 year old nephew talks about pokemon.  DEMIQEER I CHOOSE YOU!!!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Transgender really refers to anyone outside the cisgender dichotomy. The reason being is they all share the experience of dissonance when forced to adhere to common & established gender roles that is based on their physical appearance that is in conflict to their gender identity.  All attempts to change the mind to be more congruent to the physical appearance has failed in the over 3 centuries of extensive efforts made by science, so we can put the discussion of a 'cure' to bed now.  Transsexual is the outer, most extreme type of transgenderism where the term 'X trapped in a Y body' is often used to explain the experience. The medical diagnosis of this is called Gender Identity Dysphoria (GID).  In reality, nothing is that straight forward & all kinds of human differences statistically fall on their respective bell curve.  Just because we concentrate on extremes (100% male or 100% female), it does not follow that there are no variations upon closer inspection & any variation to the gender dichotomy falls under the banner of Transgender because that is exactly what it is.  Transgender was always used an an umbrella term for all non-binary identities but in the last 5 or so years, the term has been co-opted by some transsexuals that think their label sends the wrong idea ... which it does. The difference being, a transgender person may not always want a 'sex change', a transsexual almost always does or at the least, will render their genitals unworkable & their ability to procreate reduced to nil..  The problem I see is that I, a Transsexual, do not identify as trans or non-binary, I identify as female. Transsexual or transgender does not reflect who I am, just explains my physical state which is what I am trying to change for myself. Why would I move from a term describing a physical state I do not identify with to a term describing another physical state that I do not identify with?  The more we try to hold onto the gender dichotomy (which includes transsexuals as they are moving, or have moved from one extreme to the other), the more displacement & dissonance non-binary transgender people will feel because I would hope by now, people understand life cannot be explained in extremes & evolution does not deal with absolutes.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I don't understand why bother trying to label a concept that, by it's very nature, is fluid. That would be like coming up with a name for every single shade and hue of every color conceivable. Then it's my fault for assuming that the color was red, when it identifies as carnelian.  That's what most 'non-binary gendered' people want, a label, something they can call themselves that either includes or excludes people based on the labels they have, or don't have. It makes them feel special, either included in the group or unique, because no one else shares that label. I personally hate labels. I don't think people should be divided by their gender, race, sexuality, culture, etc. I would prefer that everyone comes together, in one big tie dye of people, no labels, no boundaries, no individual colors or creeds, just people, being people.

"Gender describes a specific group of traits which are genetically determined. Bar abnormalities, all men share certain traits and all women share traits. These traits hugely affect whom we are as people physically, socially, and psychologically. Many of these traits are imperceptible to us, such as men's tendency to take risks and women's superior language skills. Someone identifying as a certain gender might use certain traits to decide they are non-binary. But that certainly doesn't mean that they're not gendered in other ways. It is simply delusional to say that you are not something that you are. A man who likes wearing dresses and makeup and gets on better with women may feel actually like they are a woman, but their gender is defined by their genetic traits, not their personality.   This non-binary stuff is just all so dreadfully trivial, because the people identifying as strange genders are defining gender by characteristics other than genetics. The public at large, however, experience gender in the way genetics plays out and so, effectively, defines gender solely based on genetics.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

(Aside from the word non-binary, I guess.) For me, being clear to other people is a bigger priority than finding a word that I think exactly matches my gender identity, because I feel like no such words have been established yet and saying I'm not a man and not a woman just works way better. Sure, that still throws a lot of people who are used to thinking in the male-female binary for a loop and it takes time for them to process it, but it's easier for them to understand as a concept. As a result, I use singular they as my pronouns of choice and use non-binary as a description of my gender.   And just to undercut assumptions people might have: I also identify as transgender, because I'm planning to get surgery and I still recognize myself in the struggles my transgender friends who identify as male or female face, even if they're not 100% the same.

If someone doesn't want their lives to be defined by their reproductive organs, then that's something I can actually get behind. However, as you pointed out, we live in a capitalist society, which means that I only care about other people in as far as they have something that I can benefit from, so if they have something that can benefit me then I'll care about what is necessary to get what it is that will benefit me.

URL  (Search 'genderqueer' to find the comments I've copy and pasted.)  [1] _The key difference - the reason the analogy between trans* and otherkin doesn't work - is that all trans* people, regardless of their assigned gender, the gender they present as or the gender they identify with, all have identities that lie squarely within the overall human experience. Transwomen and transmen have a gender that equates to that of cisgender women or cis men. Even genderqueer people can be loosely compared to intersex individuals (in terms of identity matching physicality). No matter where you lie on the gender spectrum there is, (more or less) a corresponding human physicality that matches it._  _This is not true of Otherkin. Whilst a trans* person may identify with a gender whose physical characteristics manifest in other humans naturally (read: a cis person), there are no 'assigned otherkin at birth' - no human is born with the physical characteristics of an animal, or an animal-human hybrid. In order to equate trans* people to otherkin, you would have to expand human identity to encompass the lived experience of animals, which whilst interesting philosophically, is not meaningful in any medical or scientific context._  _In essence, there is no Otherkin equivalent of 'cis' to make the comparison to trans people relevant._ [/1]  [2] _Genderqueer, that's quite simple. What happens if a brain ends up only partially feminized or partially masculinized? You end up with genderqueer._  _I think agender is similar, with a brain sex somewhere in between, but for identity reasons, people would rather label themselves outside of the gender spectrum entirely. At some point, it is a bit of semantics. If your brain is halfway between male and female, do you identify as halfway in between or just declare that since your brain essentially has no sex, you're outside the spectrum entirely? Similar with dual-gender. I think all the nonbinary identities essentially result from some degree of intersex brain structure and people just choose whatever label they're most comfortable with._ [/2]","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hm, after The Matrix, Im wondering. This is more about the fluider perception of male/female. Since youve hinted at playing games before, I think you might have already noticed that a lot of men play female characters. Im not talking just about MMOs, where playing as a female character may yield a lot of benefits in social interactions, like other players giving you more stuff etc. Read benevolent sexism. Im talking about games like, let's say, Bayonetta, which require so much attention to play properly that you can't watch her most of the time, but you have to mostly watch your enemies. You sort of have to partake in the fantasy of BEING Bayonetta, even if you were a fairly masculine man, and its sort of like youre doing all those sexy moves not for yourself but for the uptight angels with their pompous, smug sense of moral superiority. Wouldn't that give an uncommon experience to a man?  I personally play most RPGs (I dont play MMOs though) and other games as a woman, even though I consider myself to be a man, as far as I can tell. Some people use the excuse of 'watching women butts is more agreeable to a heterosexual men, than watching male butts regardless of whether its Commander Shepard's or some Metal Gear character's', but I find that one to be a bit lacking. Id say most men just dont know why they find it more appealing, and they just use it as a convenient explanation. Id play a female character even in an first-person game, if I can. Like in TES  or latter-day Fallouts for example.  And when it comes to wierd avatars, you havent seen my Saints Row characters. Hulk De Niro with purple bra, no panties and tanning lines, or a Golden God in what amounts to loin cloth at best.

"Gender and gender roles are not the same thing.  Hence why we have to include the word 'roles' at the end.  People can say the do not follow the traditional gender roles, but that doesn't make them a different gender.  Your biology determines that.  If SJWs want to change the definition to fit their view of reality, then that's on them, but that doesn't mean I am now forced to use their language.  When I say someone is a 'female' and use the corresponding pronouns, I am referring to her biology not the traditional gender roles.  I work with fruit flies, and we use the male/female symbol to identify their sex - not because they wear dresses and play with dolls, but because that is their fucking sex.  We don't have a problem with these people so much because they are obviously deluding themselves because they want to feel special.  The problem we have is with them trying to force their delusions on us.  SJWs try to force people to call them by whatever pronouns they have, and even threaten physical harm on those who do not accept it.

"Not your best work to be honest. I was truly wanting to be convinced one way or another on this subject, but alas, no.  You threw up some easy straw men, then knocked them down, and either disregarded any real arguments or dismissed them with bias confirmation. Argument 1, was not an argument, just a silly statement so we can all ignore it and your response.  Argument 2 , your '5 seconds ago', was in fact over 40 years ago, so although it was in the DSM for 21 years, it has not been in the DSM for 43 years, so to continue with your maths it was only considered by science to be a mental disorder for 2 seconds. You then slide in the phrase 'keep in mind there are multiple dimensions to gender', and make this statement as if it is fact. This is conflating biological sex and gender with masculine and feminine social trends. Let's not forget that until the 1920's pink was for boys and blue was for girls. Argument 3 you dismiss although you actually agree with it personally. You don't feel a gender. My biggest problem with all this, is that there doesn't even seem to a definition for non-binary. I thought we were talking about people who wish to identify as both or neither biological sex? However you seem to be talking about people who just wish to break with traditional societal gender roles. Again you slide in a sneaky 'statement of fact' ; ' That you have been conditioned to be male'. Given that you have no other experience than your own, how can you be certain that you were conditioned, how can you possibly know as a statement of fact that would not feel the same way if your parents had raised you as a girl and not a 'maine' (I hope I pronounced that correctly, I don't want to be blamed for a triggering) . I am not saying one way or another, wether this is true or not. But I find your statement a confirmatory  bias with zero support. Argument 4. While English is an ever changing language, the only risk I see here that you seem to have dismissed is the power of language as stated with New Speak. If 'they' changes meanings, then the thought that goes with it also changes. Once this change takes place power and truth is given to the word. For this reason I would argue more for words like Ze, because they are different, and because they are uncomfortable. That would mean the concept would have to stand up in it's own right, and that it would not receive power through language. Besides which Wittgenstein was a boozy swine, who was just as sloshed as Schlegel. Arguments 5 and 6 are essentially the same, and can be countered with the following. You don't believe in pineapple gender, well I am Atheist to non-binary genders, I just don't believe in one gender more than you do. Just as a society is may seem nicer by making room for religion, does not make that society as a whole any better, and arguably worse. I could claim the same. Nice is not always good. Argument 7, although I think you have stated it a little too simplistically, is for mine the best argument. And again I think we need to define non-binary, you seem at one point to be saying that this is just people breaking with gender stereo type social roles, but those whole claim to non-binary and gender fluid, state that they are much more, and that they are a different sex. And to this point I think our children should not be confused, regardless of social constructs of work, and wealth and how we live our lives, until the end of humanity the female of our species will be bleeding on the birthing bed. What she does outside of that will change through ages, but I don't see how this is enhanced by the demi queer zhe people.

"To me, this felt like one of those response videos where a person picks the dumbest arguments of their opposition and 'debunks' them. Most of the arguments to non-binary genders, like literally anything else, are fucking stupid, but they're really not what's at issue. You only very briefly touched on the concept of 'transtrenders,' but I feel like this is the single argument against recognition of non-binary genders that has any merit. Teenagers seeking to distinguish themselves from their peers, who would've identified as 'emo' 10 years ago and will likely transition out of the 'phase' like so many of us do (myself included), are co-opting the transgender movement and reducing its legitimacy by making it less palateable to mainstream society. It is much easier to wrap one's head around the idea of 'I was born a man but feel like a woman and would like to be treated as such' than, say, a 15 year old saying 'today I feel demi polygender and my pronouns are xir and xim,' especially if you're a republican that has only just figured out the gay thing. I think in a world where transgender people aren't actively fighting for rights, recognition of transtrending buzzword genders wouldn't be harmful, but I feel that people who use non-binary genders as nothing more than something fun to play around with and be unique delegitimize the struggles of actual transgendered people, and even those of people who truly identify as non-binary whose identities should be respected.   I'm not sure I ever formed a coherent point in there but hopefully this makes sense to you. I love your channel's content and I think you're hilarious, and you truly do make me see things from a perspective different from my own.

"Blaire's argument is false even taken as is, because Gender Dysphoria doesn't mean you have to go 100% to the opposite; this is why transwomen who like power tools are still transwomen. It even says that the definition for transgender is gender nonconformance, not wanting to be the exact opposite sex. Under this definition, ContraPoints is a transgender person who doesn't identify as transgender and likely doesn't have gender dysphoria, something that the APA definition _also_ accounts for. In fact, I'll quote it, since no one is going to read this full comment anyway:  URL _Transgender is an umbrella term for persons whose gender identity, gender expression or behavior does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth. Gender identity refers to a person's internal sense of being male, female or something else; gender expression refers to the way a person communicates gender identity to others through behavior, clothing, hairstyles, voice or body characteristics. 'Trans' is sometimes used as shorthand for 'transgender.' While transgender is generally a good term to use, not everyone whose appearance or behavior is gender-nonconforming will identify as a transgender person. The ways that transgender people are talked about in popular culture, academia and science are constantly changing, particularly as individuals' awareness, knowledge and openness about transgender people and their experiences grow._  That said, apparently there are _two_ APAs, and that isn't the one that wrote the DSM-5. The other APA (Psychiatry, as opposed to Psychology) acknowledges non-binary people and uses the same definition of transgender, though makes it clear that gender non-conformity itself isn't gender dysphoria. URL They even mention nonstandard pronouns.  > _Gender dysphoria involves a conflict between a person's physical or assigned gender and the gender with which he/she/they identify. People with gender dysphoria may be very uncomfortable with the gender they were assigned, sometimes described as being uncomfortable with their body (particularly developments during puberty) or being uncomfortable with the expected roles of their assigned gender._   Me being uncomfortable with my _HORRID FACE STUBBLE_ and _BODY HAIR_ or the fact that people refer to and treat me as a male doesn't mean that I have to be uncomfortable with my dick, which is actually pretty fun, even if I'd rather be buggered.

"I think the issue is that gender is basically meaningless independent of sex. We define gender as (... well the dictionary still uses it as a synonym for sex, but I'll work with new terminology) secondary characteristics, behaviours, and identity traits associated to a sex. Eg: chest hair, deep voice, aggressive masculine vs smoother, softer voiced, passive feminine. Not necessarily requirements to be male or female, but generally more characteristic of one or the other and not often both.  This whole thing operates like a sliding scale. Or I guess a series of sliding scales. Masculine gender defining one extreme for all of them and feminine the other. Additional genders don't really make sense in this context. Especially when most of these new genders don't really define a 3rd extreme, but instead define an arbitrary position on the slider or some specific combination of masculine & feminine traits. And if they DO involve a 3rd extreme, generally they aren't defining something characteristic of a sex like both other genders do, but instead they're just conflating eccentric characteristics with gendered ones.  I don't think you can effectively make new genders with the same kind of substance that masculine & feminine have. They're based in our sexually dimorphic nature as a species, and they basically exist to describe that phenomenon.  With intersex, you have the same issue. (It's probably why the issue is present with gender to begin with.) You don't really get a 3rd sex. You get a random mutation, hormone imbalance, extra or missing chromosomes or something of that nature. The result is a (usually sterile, sometimes lethal, rarely anything but superfluous) mixture of male and female characteristics.  Even looking at all the examples of additional cultural genders and modern psychological genders, they're still almost all defined by the binary.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"See, where I perceive the problem is with 'transtrenders' wanting gender to be appart from sex, when gender is a stance on ones own sexuality, the two being intrinsecally related. You can see existing genders like 'gay' or 'bisexual' refeering to what people do with their own sexuality. Even the 'Genders' of other cultures reflect such a stance, like the 'kathoey' of Thailand, or the 'Hijra' of India/Pakistan/Bangladesh'.    But the 'new' genders barely seem to adress anything but secondary sexual characteristics, precisely the ones that do not define gender. Even when used in pronoums like 'Zi' or 'singular they' it refeers to little as a descriptive term, is is instead used as a negation of the primary sexual characteristics this people do share in common with already recognized genders (like the previously mentioned kathoey have in common with transgenders). It's like saying 'It's not your bussiness' reflects actual information on gender, when it's the negation of such information; 'Zee' and 'They' are used in the same exact way.    It's precisly the contrary of what health profesionals do, when we point out the superfluous and ever changing nature of secondary sexual characteristics.

"Here's what I don't understand, why are you so concerned with how people refer to you when you aren't around? Think about it, does anyone refer to someone by a pronoun when they are speaking directly to them? Seems strange.  Also, gender is not confusing to 99.7% of the population. It is only confusing to a tiny amount of the population, thus why having psychology study it and have terminology for it is a good thing. It helps us better understand those people and help them. It's not in any way insulting, like you insinuated. You also failed to comment on how much research and how far we have come in terms of psychology which makes your argument about 'hysteria' invalid considering we did not have the knowledge or technology we do now.  You're failing to recognize that being gender confused is a deviation from the norm. (Deviation does not disparage in this instance because I am using it as terminology) It is out of the ordinary for people to feel confused about their gender. Seems to be primarily  issue in first world countries in individuals that are higher up Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. I'm noticing the rise in this while simultaneously watching the death of punk rock. Back before tumblr and the fetish of victim status, people that were disenfranchised youth that were pissed at the world (similar to those that are 'dragon-kin' now) would go to punk shows and dress taboo and be just general weirdo's. Now that punk is dead and tumblr is king, those kids that would have been going out to punk shows, are sitting at home looking at tumblr. They're getting no experience out in the world and they're making up genders to have an identity- much like those of us that held on to the identity as punk. That was sort of an obnoxious way of saying: I truly believe this is a phase of kids being kids.

'there are multiple dimensions to gender' - in a way yes, but it's not 'biological sex, social rules, gender identity'. socially invented roles have nothing to do with it. a better split would be: 'sex chromosomes, genitals (which afaik don't always follow the chromosomes), expression, and maybe identity'.  some people in the comment section bring up words like 'kathoey' and 'hijra' as alleged examples of genders other than male/female being a thing long before modern times, but what they're missing there is that those are simply names of those cultures for transsexuals, not different genders. they're simply showing that gender identity disorder isn't new. as opposed to this non-binary nonsense.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The 'its new and i dont like it' are used by feminists, but it has nothing to do with gender. There are only two genders, if you think you arent a male human, then you have a mentla disorder and you need to seek help.   The thought  of there being more than one gender are unreasonable and idiotic. Realy, how can we 'make' more genders? It is impossible.   You are born either boy og girl. if you act like a boy but are girl, there is nothing wrong with that, or the other way around. But there are no more genders than two. If you are a boy, dressing as a gril, you are just cross-dressing, confusing for those who may find you attractive, but do not make a gender out of it. Again if you are born a boy but your mind says girl, then you have a mental disorder.  'gender identity' is (in my opinion)  a life style, and does not apply to the real genders. Still mental disorder. -what does being gay have to to with this. Gay is also a life style, but not a disorder since its about sexual urge and sexual preference. And being gay may not even be about sexual preference, it may come from bad experiences with women. --they are way different, gay is something you choose. You do not choose which gender you are. if you acctualy feel like you are a girl (but born boy) then you have a mental disorder.  You dont need to feel like a man to be a man. You can be realy feminin and still be a man.  Yes gender to YOU are what you choose, but that is not gender.  Argument 4 must not be that spread, never heard it. It does not mean it doesnt exist It may be wery well spread. Just saying ive never heard it.  nr 5. what  nr 6. ffs. gender are not something you choose, it is already chosen for you when your dad came in your mom and the sole-survivor sperm breached the eggs defences.  nr 7.

"This was funny but I didn't like the arguments you retorted.  I can get behind this not being a mental illness - 'Gender dysphoria' but I still can't get over the fact that this whole idea of gender, non-binary genders and transgenderism justifies gender roles? What I'm seeing is that someone is non-binary usually because of the clothes they wear, the toys they played with as a child etc.  Why do we need these gender labels? Why do we need people complaining because someone mis-gendered them? What purpose does all this actually serve when we could just do away with the whole idea and let people wear and do what they like as long as it harms no one else?  I want an explanation to how these genders differ from just people having different personalities. This is why the gender dysphoria argument and mental illness makes sense to me, to compare it to being gay being called a mental illness seems facetious - You are born in to a certain sex, you feel extremely uncomfortable with this body you've been given, that doesn't seem anything like being gay to me, gay people aren't uncomfortable with the way they were born.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'Non-binary people don't need to provide any arguments in support of their own existence' So you're just going to dremove the burden of proof on someone? Why, because they are so obviously right? Of no, its because of 'FREEDOM'. Apparently, freedom proves that there is such a thing as a non-binary person. This is totally not a weak and obvious attempt to avoid the burden of proof and mindlessly accept one side of the argument while ctitiquing the other, thus creating a double standard. We use honest logic here.     So Blaire pointing out that being transgender is a medical diagnosis is an appeal to authority, though she never appealed to any authority and this is wrong because 'But...but... scientists might be wrong' How about being a slight bit honest and actually look up the science insstead of making this strawman of Yours?      Saying 'many Dimensions to gender' is not an argument. You need to show that these 'Dimensions' illustrate that there  is at least a possibility that there are more than two genders, or genders in the first Place. Whoops, forgot. Non-binary genders don't have to be proven, jsut accepted mindlessly. We being all logical and reasonable in here.     Prove than gender Identity, what gender you feel you are proves that there are more than two genders.     Great. You provided a great argument against non-binary genders.

"Well, I think Blair's argument is that dysphoria is a real condition, and also one that applies to other things, such as people that don't feel right with a certain body part (a condition that, if anything, almost necessitates a potential treatment of dysphoria that doesn't require body change to be developed, since the body change usually ends up being amputation). Do nonbinary people even have that? It seems to me like the main thing they and you run into is that they don't feel like they fit into the 'gender role' of woman (or man). I don't necessarily fit into the gender role of man, but neither do I care and never did I think this made me different. It really does feel like people just having some normal divergence from gender roles and blowing it up either because of significant divergence, not knowing better, wanting to be special or have social justice / genderqueerness cool points.  I guess what I'll say here is...it's like food. You can love food, hate it, or have no opinion on it, you can go from loving to hating and backwards. A lot of nonbinary people seem to say that they actually like alien food, which doesn't exist and they never tasted it so how would they know? Meanwhile they all make big cookbooks about this alien food and which food they like most.   I used to hate the idea of gender roles; now I think they're just things that usually fit but should be disobeyed if you don't feel that you fit them. I'll deviate from them whenever I damn well please and you should too. But this seems like the opposite of that, and it's what I don't like most about a lot of this new left stuff - rather than deny the idea of abnormality as a stigma, they've simply tried to redefine what normal should mean, which is very strange because a norm is really just a sort of statistic, one usually performed by the brain and not by a calculator but which encapsulates the majority opinion or behavior. How that relates to this is that, rather than say 'i'm not a traditional woman and that's totally fine' they just say 'well I might not be a traditional woman, which is bad, but I'm a totally traditional Demigirl or Cloudgender or (yeah you saw that list, you know we could be here all fucking day lol)'. In a way it offers more flexibility, but it just seems stupid and focuses too much on categories instead of arguing that we are all too big to fit categories, even if we mostly fit a category we will have corners that poke out and we should be just fine with that.  You say gender's been very different in history, by the way - care to elaborate? I think a lot of what we describe as 'gender roles' are just generalised desires held by most men and women, as well as reactions and similar. And I really feel like the culturally constructed model is more of a function of faith held by those who are biased towards thinking people can be indoctrinated, whereas the opposite model is partly libertarian faith (people are individualistic) but also based on very consistent historical patterns, placing an enormous burden of proof on the culturally constructed side to demonstrate that all of it, even in the here and now, is culturally constructed.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You went into picking apart the argument against Blaire in regards to scientific consensus - which you done admirably but I think you are fundamentally missing the most important thing.

In this we can posit that biological sex is the framework for gender as there is no instance of a gender forming the framework for a biological sex.

Perhaps I'm not putting this into words too well but I hope you can see the argument I'm trying to form here.

"I object to non-binary identities because I think, linguistically, and philosophically speaking, it's meaningless drivel 99/100 times.  You have your sex, whatever that is, and you have your identity, whatever that is. Gender isn't a thing period, except as a descriptive term for the idea that sex and personality is linked.  It's a confused and annoying term that, no matter what you do with it, essentially lends itself to the idea that being, in terms of sex, a man or woman, or whatever, somehow implies something above and beyond your hormones, your reproductive system, and your chromosomes. It also isn't even relevant to almost any conversation ever - except if your a self-obsessed, self-important and entitled person with deep-set insecurities.  When you start confusing sex with identity and get the bastard term of gender, you inevitably begin saying and thinking stuff that makes no sense what so ever.  Okay, great, you feel like a woman, man, neither, whatever.  Now tell me, what does that mean? Can you qualify and quantify what it means to feel like a man or a woman? Do men and women feel the same way respectively as a result of being a specific sex?  Does it mean wanting to entertain traditional ideas of femininity and masculinity? If it does, you're now just confirming the gender binary, or some other limiting idea about gender, the very thing you want to end.  If it doesn't mean that, then what does it mean? If it refers to sex, then what does your feelings matter? You can feel like a woman all they long, but if I don't see you as one due to a series of obvious factors, then what does it matter? After all, in what possible way does sex matter except in terms of sex, and as a straight man, I don't have sex with men.  If we're not talking about sex, then you 'gender' identity doesn't matter - your identity does - which you cannot reduce to your 'gender' or sex unless you want to be guilty of propagating static, and therefore limiting and oppressive, expectation and ideas of how any given 'gender' I.E sex should be, act or think.  You are who you are. You're made up of your biological flesh suit, whatever that is, and your mind and the expression thereof, but the two are not the same simply because both of them make up what is you. Saying : I don't feel like a man or a woman, or I feel like a man, or I feel like a woman, is pointless because man and woman refers to features of your flesh-suit, and what you feel like refers to what's going on in your mind.  I don't care what's going on in your mind when we're talking about your flesh-suit and when I'm talking about your mind, your personality identity etc. I don't care about your flesh-suit.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Few keks thrown at the people spouting my archaeology, muh culture of genders.  Societies having different ideas of gender roles is not multiple genders. It's a difference in culture.  Gods or Goddess having two genders or both isn't a argument for multiple genders. That's a culture kinda doing what it does. Do the smurfs validate the blue man group? Humans do lots of weird shit, I think, therefore I am doesn't always work. At a certain point you are rejecting reality and I believe these genders do very much that.  Archaeology as flawed as it can be and culture of genders doesn't disestablish the long and evidence wall of sexual dimorphism or two genders. It's a very poor and flakey argument. Societies are weird and interesting, just like ours. Imagine if purposed validity for a patriarchy due to its great societal successes? You'd dissect that pretty quick.

"Yes, language is an important tool that evolves and mutates by our use of it, but lets not forget what George Orwell had to say about language and why he invented Newspeak for his novel '1984.' It was a tool for the state to exercise a form of thought control. It predicted the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.  This list of new genders isn't necessarily a grass roots movement against gender orthodoxy as you claim. It looks like a form of gender feminist orthodoxy that has at its roots a strange contradiction. Have you forgotten how feminists defined gender as a 'social construct' and something not related to sexuality? Well, these new genders do seem to be related to sexuality and sexual orientation. They sound more like weird fetishes than genders. In the feminist definition of gender it came with socially constructed roles and responsibilities, sociocultural roles like men paying for dates, men getting drafted, women staying home with the kids and taking care of the house and whatever else goes along with those gender roles.  No one ever gave these new genders any roles I know of and I have no expectations for something I didn't know exists, and no social organism constructed these new genders. It defies the feminist definition of gender and makes no sense. Like I said, the new genders do seem related to sexuality. Do these odd people know the difference between a gender and a fetish, or a sexual orientation? Do they know the difference between bisexuality and 'gender fluid'? I'm not sure I do. Is there a difference?  I know there are bronies, furries, and cloppers. That last one, 'cloppers,' is people with a sexual fetish for the cartoon characters in the animated TV series 'My Little Ponies.' Furries are people with a fetish for having sex in furry cartoonish animal costumes. Does that qualify as a gender? Or is it just a fetish?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I disagree, because you do NOT need to appropriate the concept of gender to create a label for expressing your individuality.  Gender has always been binary in its abstract. For example, masculine = more aggressive and feminine = less aggressive. Making it a non-binary question destroys this essential dynamic completely.  Transgenderism, or terms like 'gender-fluid', 'gender non-conforming' etc. are fine because they can reflect a person's response to the abstract concept of gender without implying there are more than two.

"All gender is is the general behavior that a particular sex engages in. If, say, 60% of men engage in a certain behavior while woman generally don't, then that behavior is effectively a masculine behavior. Just because you are part of that male 40% that doesn't engage in that behavior, does not mean you are suddenly a brand new gender. You are just going against the norm. Gender is based off of biological sex, so inventing new genders makes no sense when there are only two sexes.   You brought up a picture of intersex, but those are just defects in genes. If there were other forms of biological sex then they would more than likely be just as common as the two main ones; but they aren't. This is important because there is a reason for there being differing sexes. There is a reason for why humans aren't all the same, completely bereft of sex differences. It's because our species has a very specific function that requires the two sexes: men and women fuck to make babies.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Modern men  can't do these good and cool things, hence the need for new genders. Modern masculinity is restrictive and boring. How the fuck is a man supposed to be elegant nowadays? A fucking tuxedo! That's droll as shit! There's so much more to girl clothing.  That's why the gender queers are going to succeed in public opinion, just like us regular queers did. It's cooler and more fun to shirk gender roles than be the dude who demands every other dude commit to dull beige masculinity. This is being reflected in modern media.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"So as someone who much like Contra and one of the commenter's, I'm pretty gender apathetic (and formerly trans, now I just self-identify as 'self' or '?')   The discussion I would like to put forward is the significance of destroying a dual-gendered system. While I entirely support this concept, a lot of the people coming up with new genders (again basically all non-binary or non-identifying with gender/roles) actually tend to be invested in this new gender as well, they see it as part of their identity, not an attempt at socially acceptable anarchism and rebellion to further the future generations. Thing is, they are destroying the gender norms and that's just damn fine, but they don't understand that their gender is essentially meaningless at that point- it's only a tool, a label.    Gender, shouldn't exist. Sex exists and helps us medically diagnose things (kind of..) based on broad very generalized categories (again not very useful, but still has a use). It's a social construct that was a useful tool back in the day but in a post-modern, soon post-contemporary society, it's something to be rid of. After all, is it so hard to believe that oneself is the most important thing to identify as?     Having a severe dysphoria prior, I realized that even if I could swap genders, those feelings wouldn't go away unless I got happy with the idea of myself as a person, and make the body match my persona. ... Er, as least as much as one can.   I feel like it's an essential building block- Destroying gender, that is, to move down this whole trans-humanism world view that my generation is starting to adopt, especially since we have the technology and whatnot already. We're already moving slowly but surely past the physical limitations, with bionics, advanced robotics, heck- even Virtual Reality to a degree. But, more importantly as we move down this path it's very important to realize as individuals our values, over/transcending gender.   You are not just a man, you are not just a woman, you are not some purplehaired mylittleponykin-gender. And that's okay! Neither am I, nor anyone else. But what we are, are ourselves, and we have the power and the freedom to actually choose how we are now. So why do we choose to think inside this same old box?   On that same note, I also feel like a lot of the discussions are spurred on by angsty self-hatred (given how young the majority are) instead of an attempt to really just find balance with yourself and be firm in it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Here's my 0.02.  The slide you showed at 3:34 is right on the money.  Epigenetics may also effect brain formation and behaviour, but it does not create separate chromosomal structures.  So, the vast, vast majority of humanity is either XX or XY, with a tiny, tiny minority that is not.  And most of those produce a phenotype that is indistinguishable from the 'norm'.

"Here is an analysis of your arguments. Some 'contra points' if you will (har har). I hope someone finds this interesting. Comment and discuss! :)     Argument 1) Granted. However, if you 'just go along with things' that is rather untypical. That will very likely never be normal. Having moral reactions to things is part of what makes us human. There is a difference between controlling your reaction, and not having one. Thus, it would seem strange if you were to argue that we SHOULD 'just go along with things' like you do, and that that is somehow the 'better' mindset. It doesn't seem like you are saying that, but you are kind of implying it, by ridiculing other people's moral outrage at cannibalism, etc.   Argument 2) Big mistakes on your part here. Saying 'in the past, science said homosexuality was a medical condition, therefore X' is surely a very bad argument. You cannot be made right by mere analogy or reference to the past here. You would have to show, meticulously, why the current psychological and medical community is right or wrong on something, regardless of what they have been right or wrong on before.  Further, 'an appeal to the authority of current medical practice' is a completely legitimate appeal! Just like you appeal to the authority of the current scientific consensus on climate change, physics, and all manner of other things that you are not an expert in. We know how the scientific method works, and therefore we can make the good assumption that the current scientific consensus is most likely the best current explanation of what is actually real. To dismiss it in one sentence, by reference to the past, is not the best idea.   When you say 'there is probably no gay gene' I'm rather confused. Yes. yes there very much is a genetic basis for homosexuality. That this genetic basis is colloquially referred to as 'the gay gene' is a slight misnomer, but you should know better than that. Equally confusing is your quote 'psychiatrists make shit up as they go along just like anybody and invent new words for things all the time.' First of all, that is a gross misrepresentation of psychiatry and you know it. Second, why would you overlay that quote with the word 'hypomania'? As if that were an example of the 'bullshit' that psychiatrists supposedly come up with.   On your point about Identity: If you define it as 'your inner sense of what gender you are' then you run into some problems. For instance:  You know how you feel. You do not really know how anyone else feels. That is, you don't know what it is like to actually be anyone other than yourself. Thus, if you are a man thinking 'I feel like a woman' or 'my inner sense is that I am a woman' then you're faced with the problem of not knowing what it is to be a woman. Thus, how on earth can you know that you feel like a woman? What is the 'inner sense' of a woman? What is womanness, essentially? As you can see, we are off the field of science and rationality, and on the field of Woo Woo, religion and superstition. Thus, it is perfectly reasonable to question the existence of 'non-binary' people, in just the same way that it makes no sense to question the existence of homosexuals. The former is based on nothing but personal claims about feelings, the latter is based on genetic factors.   None of this would bother anyone, if the 'non-binary' people wouldn't insist on everyone changing their behaviour and their speech based on these superstitions about identity. Just like no one would care about the religious, if the religious left everyone else alone.   What is more likely, that many teenagers suffer from depression, anxiety and feelings of 'not belonging' and thus glom onto this internet train of non-binary genders in an escapist attempt to find a non-judgemental community, OR that there is actually something very different going on in their brain that would best be explained by introducing a long list of possible gender identities (most of which have been made up by said teenagers)?  No contest.    Argument 3) You've kind of proven my point here. You don't really know what you feel like do you? You don't really think that you feel like a woman or a man or whatever. You just feel like you, and you have no idea what it is to feel like something else. All we have is our own personal feelings of identity, and what everyone else says about theirs. What solid conclusions can you really come to, knowing only this? How does this support the existence of 'non-binary' genders?    Argument 4) You're right, language is, for the most part, arbitrary and merely a tool of communication. BUT, that doesn't mean 'anything goes.' Within a language as it is currently spoken, there is a correct way of saying something, and an incorrect way. You get points taken off your philosophy paper if you say 'betwixt' like Hume, or use 'thou' instead of 'you' etc. Language evolves slowly, and always faces resistance to change. Just saying 'language changes, people! say 'ze' and 'zir!' what's the big deal?' isn't going to cut it.   There is a very big difference between language changing naturally (dropping a letter here and there, or changing the meaning of a word, or its pronunciation) and someone telling us to 'speak differently, goddammit!'  The one is natural and goes mostly unnoticed, the other is an imposition. This is where the whole political correctness debate comes in. I'm sure you are familiar with it, so I won't waste more time on it. I'm simply saying that this worry cannot just be dismissed, or misrepresented by suggesting that 'languages just changes naturally.'    Argument 5) the most interesting part of what you say here is 'surely a society that makes room for those people [non-binary] is more humane that one that doesn't.'  This is a very big claim and you aren't supporting it at all. What do you mean by 'make room', what do you mean by 'more humane' in this case? Here is a counter-example:   There have been some cases now in which a criminal was convicted of a crime and sentenced to jail. It turns out that they were sentenced to male prison, which didn't make them very happy, because they identify as female and demanded to be sent to female prison. I've seen facebook and twitter outrage over this injustice! People are up in arms to support this person's right to be sent to the prison they are most comfortable in, in terms of their identity...   THIS is the kind of story that creates antagonism towards the 'non-binary' and 'trans' advocacy crowd. The only thing we have is their word that they are a certain gender. Trying to accommodate these people in society in any legally meaningful way is to effectively legislate feelings. A very dangerous proposition.   But then again, 'making room' in society might mean something more harmless. All I know is that I'm not really interested in entertaining and even enabling the superstitious beliefs of depressed, unpopular teenagers. You can call yourself whatever you want, but don't try to make me look like an immoral person if I don't refer to you with your preferred pronoun. I wouldn't call the Dalai Lama 'your holiness' just because he thinks he's holy, either.    Argument 6, 7)   'it made sense in agrarian societies to divide people up by sex and give them various roles'  This narrative suggests that gender roles are somewhat deliberate and that someone made a decision about how people with testicles should act. This is nonsense of course. Gender roles and expectations arise from a complex web of current culture, history, and our genetic predispositions. The social dynamic between men and women, in general, is very similar across most, if not all cultures. Yes, there are outliers, and yes, some individuals will never fit in due to their own personal history, mental state, or temperament, but that doesn't support the idea that gender identity is all up in the air now. No.   Most people are normal. And what is 'normal' now, is actually quite similar to what was normal in the past. We associate certain traits with men and women, and we expect certain things from them. This is not based on agrarianism or capitalism, but on the human condition. After all, can you give us some examples of how gender expectations have radically changed? And I'm not talking about some behavioural trends that were different in the past due to culture or necessity, I'm asking about instances in which gender expectations were straight up reversed.   For instance, is there a society or time in history where manliness was, on the whole,  associated with weakness and frailty? Was that ever seen as the 'attractive trait' to women? Probably not. Our behaviours and cultural gender roles are based on our very nature, that would explain why most cultures actually have similar social hierarchies and gender dynamics, and why these same types of dynamics are also found among our close relatives in the animal kingdom (and don't mention bonobos as a counter example, that debate is pretty much over, as far as I am aware).   That was a bit of a tangent there, but relevant to your quote. Thanks for reading! You need to stuff your bra! ;)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"My problem with non-binary people is that if they don't openly tell everyone they are non binary, almost all of them will be viewed as male or female in society.

"Here's the issue. The rejection of gender is the rejection of humanity. What it means to be human. Sure we are all degenerates and have our issues but to reject such a basic biological constant isn't health or wealth it's psychosis. It's not a natural deviation it's a intellectual one. It isn't gay, trans, or any of those. It's a reject of biology. That's a huge difference between being gay or trans or anything in-between. It's not biological experimentation it's intellectual. Which is fine any one can do. But intellectual ideas shouldn't be given the rights that a biological one should. It's not something anyone should have to accept but those who want too. It should be given about as much respect as someone who considers themselves Republican.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm a white, straight, cis male - I am pretty much considered the standard for what sexuality should be (however unfair this is, and it is), so I don't think I've ever had to make a conscious decision about 'feeling' my gender at any point.   Then again, I am also dysthymic and avoidant, which has made me functionally asexual for the past few years, which apparently is really hard for some people to wrap their heads around. A straight white guy around forty who isn't constantly imagining banging *all* the chicks? _What manner of sorcery is this!?_   I admire the courage and self-reflection of those who come to the conclusion that their gender identities are something other than their biological sex. It sadly took me a bit too long to get to that position, but hey - I'm here now. I don't have to completely understand what it is like to be trans or nonbinary or queer in order to understand that it is something that means something to the individual in question.

"Well, here's my take on it; seeing as the majority of humans are born either male or female and that 'girl' and 'boy' are both social constructs and biological factors to sex i believe there are only two genders. However, I do acknowledge that gender expression is a spectrum. Humans often feel the need to associate themeselves with labels to fnd those alike , thus why we're seeing all these gender variant people label themeself as something other than 'girl' or 'boy'. As someone who used to call himself 'genderfluid' I can whole heartedly say it was a product of being taught what I felt meant that was what I am. I was feminine, born female, but never felt like a girl therefor 'genderfluid'. The way I see it now, I'm just a boy that likes makeup, other boys and cute shit. There aren't more than two genders, however there is now labels for people not molding into common gender expression.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The thing is, if it wasn't for the whole ambiguity of the non-binary idea I'd probably be stuck thinking I was either cisgender or a really lazy transwoman.

"I think part of the problem with this conversation is that most people don't feel their gender, which is why cispeople have had such a hard time understanding transpeople for so long. If we didn't assign roles to any genders, some people would still have gender disphoria, and they would be transexuals. So if gender expression is a social construct, what is the difference between a self-identified non-binary person, who doesn't have disphoria, and a cisperson?  Disphoria is a crucial concept in this discussion --- something this video doesn't address. To many it is the key concept that distinguishes transpeople from transtrenders, and real non-binary people from those with an atypical gender expression.  The term 'gender identity' is confusing because having an emotional connection with people of a certain gender is not enough to make you that gender, nor is having tastes that match its expectations. Those things are part of personality.  The use of pronouns by transpeople is about not reminding them of a part of themself that they are uncomfortable with. If you don't /need/ other pronouns, then there is no point in making people use pronouns other than the one they're going to determine by looking at you.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
