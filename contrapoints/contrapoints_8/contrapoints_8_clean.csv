"With all these girls and women wearing shorter and shorter shorts and skirts, um, they kind of WANT YOU to look at their legs.....I mean, if they didn't they would wear jeans or at least normal (whatever that means) length shorts and skirts. Just the other day I was standing in line behind a girl wearing shorts so short you could literally see her ass hole. yes, her ass hole, which was probably where she hid her brain. So yeah, don't feel bad, just give them a compliment (nice shoes) or nice socks! That's all they really: a compliment. Poor skanky hoes! ps: I've started to wear ever shorter shorts, boxers some would say, to counter this 'skanky short short' phenomena hey, if they can show off their skank holes, so can i!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i realize that some people don't get this...  but at least SOME women put their bodies on display because they actually want to be seen and noticed.  some of them, however, are bigoted, shitty people and only want the attention from, what they consider to be, attractive people.  it's very likely that the exact same woman on the train might have smiled flirtatiously at a man who was looking at her legs if she found him attractive.  that's how humans interact.  it's NOT offensive to notice someone's attractiveness.  it's creepy and demonstrates a complete lack of self-awareness when you're unable to quickly recognize when the attraction isn't mutual but it's natural and, in most cases, acceptable to act upon a mutual attraction. i'm not suggesting that we should behave like animals but can't we, at least, behave like humans?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"What's confusing to me (and I know this was just a small element in this video) is how women imagine men would go about this whole feelings: ON, feelings: OFF that's expected of them? I mean to women the female body is several things, but to straight men it's mostly erotic/beautiful. Both of those things make you want to look. And looking at something doesn''t harm anyone. Turning the male attraction off would be bad for all of us who choose men as partners. I don't need them to STOP wanting me, I just don't want to be touched without consent.   And there comes the problem I have with feminists these days - they don' pick a rational goal (that is still way beyond what we can achieve in a lifetime) and focus energy on it. They choose some extreme goal down the line FROM that rational goal we could all more/less agree is right. Like instead of 'solving' what women in extremely religious groups have to endure they want men to not see women as attractive. Instead of achieving female nudity on Instagram because there's nothing wrong with sex, they want it to be allowed because 'female body isn't sexual'. Why does every self proclaimed feminist woman I know watch every available serial killer/blood and gore TV show and movie while also screaming at any sexuality or nudity in comic books, movies, games etc? When did sex become BAD and blood and gore great, this is a very scary issue in the western society if you ask me. For decades now games like Fallout for example, revolve around killing but when you hire a prostitute the screen just goes black and it comes back after the fact, when the clothes are back on.  Can't you/they see that we're teaching men that they should suppress all constructive desires and then bottle the rage and sex up until they explode in potentially murderous ways, which seem to be fine if we judge by what's okay to show on TV and what isn't?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i see so many comments below (above?) about how people started off as anti-sjw and i have to wonder why that is the default? why are some people being told from the get-go that sjw's and anything else considered 'left' on the political spectrum is ridiculous? i have never heard anything of the sort until i got into sjw youtube and heard these creators talking about backlash... from people in america? what? (granted, i was 12 and thought that all of america was equally more progressive than the rest of the world at this point in time, but still.) maybe its because i'm a girl and all of my friends are girls and i get life advice from my mom, but feminism has NEVER been a negative thing for me, it is one of the greatest parts of american culture.  and i almost don't want to say it -- at the risk of sounding sexist -- but are all of the people whose first introduction to Social Justice is from the anti-sjw side, are all of those people dudes? like, all of them? that can't be it.   i remember in elementary school, anything that the girls in class collectively agreed on automatically became off-limits for the boys. we always had to disagree on every little thing, because no boy wanted to be caught  having a 'girly opinion'. basically, what i'm trying to say is, why do i feel like the anti-sjw movement is mostly just the fault of goddamn jimmy, who kept trying to convince all of the other boys in my class that girls are lame and stupid, well into high school after it stopped being cool to hate the opposite gender? that's legitimately how i think these people keep getting their new recruits: no fully grown man ever BECOMES an anti-sjw, they all just start off as stupid teenage boys, who have been convinced by, other, even stupider teenage boys about what is cool. and hating human decency and respect is cool. which sucks","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I can kind of understand your first point about white male dominance in art, even though you exaggerate this. If you look for example at the new York times bestseller list, most authors aren't white men. Your second point is nonsense to me. A woman can wear in public whatever she wants and I can stare at her as much as I want. If a hot guys walks down the streets shirtless, he will get looks. If a woman shows her beautiful legs in public, men are gonna look at her. As long as nobody touches her against her will, there is nothing wrong. And no, asking to ban gender studies is not against free speech. Genderqueer people have every right to spread their (nonsense) opinions, but they have no right to be paid by taxpayers for it. Wouldn't you oppose it if the alt-right would get their own university courses paid by the government? This isn't anti-free speech.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

There are many men out there, who have just never thought about or heard of the 'male gaze'. They feel attacked, even if understanding starts to dawn on them. For a woman it is obvious. I am also sure some men notice it on their own. Not being able to do that, does not mean they are sexist or dump. It means they need some help figuring it out. In everyday life, we might need to be more patient, if we try to bring people (not just men) to acknowledge this world view.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Funnily enough, my introduction to feminism was the very posterchild of the angry feminist stereotype. She was very snarky and mean, would actively exclude members of our social group who were straight men, and would think nothing of randomly screaming at you if you offended her- which was very easy to do. She yelled at me for liking Twilight (I was 18 so don't @ me) and proceeded to spoil the series for me so that 'there was no need to keep reading that sexist trash'.  But honestly, she wasn't that way because she was a feminist. She was a feminist BECAUSE she was that way. I found out from a friend of hers that she had been raped, and she had become interested in feminism as a way to feel empowered and cope with the trauma. She was very bitter and angry and mean but she used feminism as a way of expressing that. If it hadn't been feminism, she probably would have found something else to feel empowered and be militant about.  Hearing shed been raped made me feel compassion for her so I decided to research feminism further and the more I read, the more it made sense. Even little subtle things, like women are encouraged not to show their anger or they're labelled as 'craxy' or 'bitchy' while men showing anger is considered manly and tough. All these things I'd put up with all my life without really noticing it. Plus there are much worse things like FGM and sex slavery- and of course rape which is what happened to this girl.  So I became a feminist. And no I'm not a bitch. I don't yell at people, I don't hate men or blame them for my problems. I just... want to be respected as much as men are respected, by both men AND other women (because I don't think women respect each other very much). and no I don't speak to that woman any more. I feel bad for her and wish her well but who wants to hang out with someone who is going to jump down your throat if you say the wrong thing? Not me for sure.  Anyway I doubt anyone will read this because this vid is 2 years old but it feels good to get this off my chest :)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I was less attractive when I was younger and got called creepy all the time... nothing about my behavior has changed (because I was feminist way before it was cool, and where I live, it still isn't) and no one thinks I'm creepy now that I'm thin and have clear skin. In the case mentioned in the video I guess it was warranted, but in my experience it's mostly just a way of being a shitty person that a lot of women have realized they can get away with. One of the major weaknesses of feminism, which makes it harder for it to resonate with male audiences, is that it doesn't really work to acknowledge the natural consequence of its very valid argument that women are people... which is that people are shitty. At least, from my perspective. I've even had women I've known nearly my whole life suddenly start treating me like shit once they started learning about feminism, I guess because they didn't know I'm a feminist? But really the reason is because they were being shitty. It's not the feminism that made them bad. The badness was inside them all along! TL;DR women suck because they are people and deserve all the same rights as men, who also suck because they are people.

"I think we've had roughly the same experience of coming around to feminism et al., with the exception, of course, that I was called out for misogynist behavior and speech in high school and *then* exposed to writings that changed my mind in college.   (If you're worried, all I did in high school was think 'sure, women are equal, but they're sure fun to make fun of,' and made an ass of myself on the subject until the girl I liked called me out in front of a lot of people for joking that women don't play chess.)  I do thoroughly agree with your note in the description, though. Some of my best English classes were the ones where we could step back from theory and appreciate things on an aesthetic level too. I knew grad students who had never had a class that wasn't 100% about theory (Marxist, feminist, queer et al) and thinking about such a dense curriculum gave me a headache. As you say, there must be a certain amount of each approach for a balanced English education. What I think tends to work is to teach theory intensively at the 100 and 200 level and in some classes at the 300 level, and let people apply the theory they subscribe to themselves (or not) at the upper 300 and 400 level.  I still prefer Homer to Austen, though, which made it all the more exciting when I learned Emily Wilson had just become the first woman to translate the Odyssey to completion.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Like you were saying your pop feminism video, feminism has taken over mainstream society and I don't know what it all means anymore.    I was what I would call an armchair feminist in college, like most other ciswomen who generally cared about women's rights but hadn't read much feminist theory literature.  Then under the influence of a fairly misogynistic ex boyfriend, I was introduced to Karen Straughan videos (she's an anti-feminist who's somewhat infamous on the internet for 'dismantling' and speaking out against feminism even though she's a woman).  Then I was Jordan Pertersonified, and took the red pill (watched the documentary).    I disagree with what seem to be  the fundamental tennants of feminism, and therefore, don't think I can call myself a feminist.  I would never deny that sexism and gender bias against women has always existed and still does, and that this has affected society in ways that has given men more of the power overall (which is why I suppose we continue to talk about the 'patriarchy').  But I don't think feminists' analysis of social issues is remotely nuanced enough, and find that a lot of modern feminism is toxic and misandric.  I also think much of history has been reframed and is now viewed through a biased, radical feminist perspective.  I guess my main problem is that I haven't been exposed to enough moderate feminists, and certainly none that can debate rationally.  So, I don't know exactly what modern feminism even is, at its core.    The defining outcome of first wave feminism was the vote.  For second wave feminism, it was giving women more reproductive rights through the pill and Roe vs Wade, as well as career options and respect.  What is the focus of third wave feminism?    I know this is a tall order, but I would love to see you make a comprehensive video on feminist theory and the history of gender politics and the women's rights movement.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I thought the 'glancing' type strategy is what most people force themselves into who do not blatantly and antisocially stare or are utterly disinterested. Similar to this 'oh no it must look like I'm staring, lets just focus on this interesting tree 20 cm to the left, I'm innocent'-kind of behaviour. I'm not sure if that's problematic, but my reaction to blatant staring has just always been to stare back until the person gets visibly uncomfortable and finally stops staring. I don't feel like it's a problem when people briefly look at my boobs once or twice. But I also think people usually don't have much self awareness if it isn't taught. So I guess it's not too bad if women show reactions to what i really like to call antisocial staring, as long as they are in an environment that is considered safe... So what I'm saying is, we kind of have to all work together to eventually all have our fair share of anxiety, glancing and personal awareness.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You say the white male perspective isn't bad, but then what is it? Why is it so prevalent and other perspectives aren't? Isn't the logical next step that the white male perspective is oppressive and corrupt and promoting it's own superiority? That's the slope that worries me about that line of thinking. It has to come with a low res narrative about history and the world we live in today that seems self destructive.  It's like, I either have to say Shakespeare had nothing particularly special or universal or amazing to say in his plays because being white and male isn't particularly special or universal or amazing, or that white male literature is some of the best literature on the planet, feeding a white supremacist narrative. And if the case is that Shakespeare did have truly universally human things to say AND he was able to do it because hes white and male, then why would I even care to read it as 'white male' literature? Why not just extract the universal themes and treat the white maleness as it should be treated everyday: irrelevant to a person's ideas.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I know this is an old video but I will comment anyway since I have only recently discovered your channel. I majored in history for my undergrad. I have always found the disconnect between sexual expression and society fascinating. I studied pornography and discovered things like Harris' List and films like Bedtime for the Bride that debuted literally months after the first public showing of films. I took a class that was titled Sexual History in the United States.   Coincidentally this is about when the shit storm was being thrown at Anita Sarkeesian. For my last research paper for the class my professor wanted something relatively modern. I just so happened to know of a game called Custer's Revenge that created quite a stir. I only knew it existed and that people were pissed. After showing my professor the clip I got the go ahead to write it.   I was definitely on the negative side of the conversation of everything I loved was sexist and awful. I dismissed the criticism entirely and was openly hostile toward it. What did I learn writing that paper about Custer's Revenge? That women had been saying things like this for decades but only now were being listened to. That was eye opening for me. It made me change my entire perspective on the whole debate and it made me shut my mouth and listen when these people were talking and telling their stories. It had me reflecting on the class as a whole and people saying the same thing about movies, photography, personal letters, politics there was just sexism bloody everywhere now. Arguments being made now had been made so many decades ago and no one cared. It blew my mind a bit honestly. I feel I came out of that class a better person and I will be forever grateful to that professor.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's interesting to see that most of these videos counteracting the shitlords  are made by people who once believed those things and have sometimes done some pretty bad things themselves. I felt a bit helpless in the face of all the videos I was getting in my suggestions after subscribing to Feminist Frequency. I didn't even watch them because I knew it would be so much bullshit and I would feel I had to do something but I had other things to deal with and felt I was just asking for a whole load more trolling. I guess the pushback against them had to come from people who knew the way these people thought, and who know about making YouTube videos. I've been making videos for years and still haven't bothered to get round to learning to edit beyond a bit off the front and a bit off the back. Mind you I'm mainly just into Martial Arts, I just do the video thing as an extension of that and tend to think it's much better to spend my time training than editing. I think people of my age tend to think it's up journalists in respectable publications to take on this kind of shit, except they don't make YouTube videos on the whole, plus tbh they are often a bit pro establishment and I don't feel they really are that thoughtful or understanding of what's going on with problems like this. They're mostly too busy pretending to be thoughtful about why trans people are just confused and really shouldn't be allowed in women's spaces or telling young people they shouldn't eat avocado toast and Jeremy Corbyn is definitely anti Semitic, this comment on this picture they dragged up from some random post on Facebook from years ago totally proves it.

"I guess the missing piece for me in terms of the white male art perspective is the implications. It seems that this line of feminist critique puts all of that art from the past beyond the scope of differing interpretation or even sublime enjoyment. I get the sense feminist 'SJW' art critics view all this art as locked into a particular context, as though it's naive or disingenuous to view it in a different light. But art often strikes us on a guttural level. Humans have a surprisingly shallow relationship to our love of aesthetics, because humans evolved to have some kind of concept of, and appreciation for, 'art.' The definition of art might be culturally specific, but we all have SOME kind of definition. Which means our love of art ultimately comes from the 'soul.'   So while it's good to know what the original context and perspective may have been - and why both may be narrow or repressive - it doesn't necessarily follow that all this old art should remain enslaved to its original purpose in our minds.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You know, as much as I enjoy your stuff, sometimes I can't tell if you are trolling or not.  You say that you re-evaluated your life because you felt guilty one time when you let your hormones override your conscious thought and good manners... and also because you read a book once that said a mostly white culture focuses mostly on European history. Although if you read about European ancient history it's hard not to start getting into Persian and north African history. Sure, scientifically speaking ancient Egyptians were a spectrum of pigmentation but it's still significant African history that is often told from an Egyptian point of view rather than a roman one, and there is also Chinese history which is amazingly deep and seen as hugely important to the development of the species.  Initiate ramble.. On the second point I freely admit that being British I might have been taught completely different things in history than you were. I know comparatively little about U.S. history... I think it went something like this...You arrived, the natives saved you, so you killed a lot of them, but you were still Europeans at that time so it wasn't your fault, then there was a lot of fighting, then you all kind of agreed for various reasons you didn't like being a colony anymore so you fought Britain with the French but now don't give them any credit. Then once you were your own free nation you invaded Canada and lost, and were embarrassed cause it was Canada so you just didn't teach it in history.  You'd already stopped white slavery at that point as they were hard to keep track of, and Chinese slavery hadn't worked out because they were good with numbers, contracts and Kung fu, but then after the rest of the western world had decided that enslaving black people was bad, some of you figured they might might be right so you 'discussed it amongst yourselves'.

"'So much historical art basically celebrates the perspective of rich 'white' men'.  I just started binge watching your videos, and I like your style, and ideas, but only agree with about 40% of what you say.  That being said, it seems to me that you'd be above making a statement like this, which, you seemingly, for impact, threw in the word 'white'.  I'm sure you know that the Art you speak of is Historical European art, which WAS, at the time, pretty much ALL WHITE (and I'm sure you also know that European art is far from the ONLY historical art... those of which depict the races of origin also).  So, by throwing that word into this statement, you are just trying to make this art, not only sound classist and sexist, but also Racist, when, from the artists perspective, this was a non-issue.  This is the most obvious thing wrong with this statement, but, loving art myself, and being from the lower end of the poverty scale, I could find fault in the entire statement, if I felt like writing a thesis :P ...   What I'm trying to say, is that you continue to make generalizations and conclusions about issues and other points of view, while criticizing others for doing the same... when you know, full well, that there is more than one way of looking at EVERYTHING.

"You are obviously a very cool person but i don't really know what to make of you. For that point regarding male  perspective in european art: As an Artist, everything you paint is from your own perspective. It was a shame but to the times of Da Vinci (i think that are vaguely the times you referred to) there was just one form of painting style that was considered art. And this were this highly detailed, beautiful oil paintings. To reach this level of perfection, you had to invest very much money from a very young age into your artistic education. And who could do that? Rich parents could do that for their children! And who would they decide on? Male Child number XY or a daughter they could marry to a somewhat important person? Therefore it wasn't the painters fault, but it was the fault of the generations they would build on. I think it's great what we have reached so far regarding equality and I hope we will see someday that everyone is truly equal in any way.

"It is very peculiar to me that one of the pivotal moments in your transition to feminism was admiring a woman's legs. I am assuming she was dressed in a way that displayed her legs in an appealing manner. If I was in your situation, I would assume she was upset that I was trying to be covert about it. She obviously wants someone to look at her legs.  The only compelling counterargument I've heard to this line of thinking is that women wearing revealing attire are 'just wearing what is comfortable'. It just seems like quite a coincidence that 'comfortable' always means something you practically have to paint on.  In the end, if you are going out into public, you can't expect people not to notice what you are wearing (or not wearing). Asking otherwise just looks like typical feminist doublethink.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Like try really really really hard to give women the facade of the fact that you're not totally checking them out?  Maybe I just don't do the exact thing you're talking about, but this seems like some self-shaming bullshit.

"Here's one thing I disagree with in here  Your 2nd bit about noticing a woman on a subway that had nice legs and you were looking, and then she called you out on looking. You treat this like an epiphany, but I would argue that they only thing that changed was a new default of feeling guilty when wanting to look at women in public.  See, I disagree completely that you ever treated her like a passive object. Your looky actions were dependent upon the assumption that she is not going to notice, and always were.   To have treated women like  passive objects, you would have had to have looked at them and been completely dead to whether or not they were noticing you looking or not. I don't believe this. I believe if you looked at a woman in public, you would have always done it discretely. So what has changed is that you feel preemptively guilty about wanting to look at women.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This kind of reminds me of something that happened to me. Years ago I was at an outdoor festival with my girlfriend at the time and I smiled in the direction of a very attractive young woman. So she said to me 'What's your problem?!' Well, I was actually smiling at my girlfriend at the time, who was looking at me right behind this other woman. She was taking some free records someone was giving away and had looked back at me and flashed a smile of her own. So I smiled back at her, not this stranger. So my girlfriend walked up to us and this other chick immediately realized what was going on. Now, even if I did smile in her direction I think that reaction is probably a bit over the top but that wasn't even the case. So she apologized to both of us and walked away looking very embarrassed.  Before that I'd been aware of women being uncomfortable around men and thought that was very understandable but I think that made me a lot more aware of how suspicious many women are of men. A lot of people would think 'That's stupid. She shouldn't have gotten angry for no reason.' Well... I mean that's not 100% off, she honestly didn't have a real reason to yell at me... But it's also true that many women have had a lot of experiences that cause them to be very suspicious and angry. So I think that day I became a lot more aware of just how deep that goes and how the rest of us should be sympathetic to that and instead of blaming other people, try to understand why they feel uncomfortable in those situations.  Anyway, I'm just thinking about that based on the subway story.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I'm out in public and they are free to look at my body. the thoughts they have about my body don't affect me if all they do is look. if they were staring at my (non- existent) tits or something while talking to me, that would be different bc it can indicate that they aren't paying attention to our conversation or that they don't even care enough to make it LOOK like they are listening. but if someone looks at me while I'm not engaging with them and isn't just staring me down, I don't see how I have the right to tell them not to look at me.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"What if we are all just an illusion? 'What if' is the first step in justification, propaganda, and promotion of platitudes. It is illusion, imagination, supposition, and confusion. Education is where the student learns. The best thing for a student is to have their ideas challenged and have to reexamine their own suppositions, assumptions and truisms. The student will either come back knowing why they believe what they believe and the factual basis for it. Or they will change their beliefs according to the contravening facts.  You are a human being and a male, but you are not a man. We are born boys and grow into being men. It's a really tough journey without a mentor, or a father who is a man. I made that journey and you can too. When a woman gives you shit for 'looking' she is flirting and shit testing you at the same time. With time a boy learns how to respond according to the attraction he feels for her and the response is his choice, that is just one mile marker on the road to be a man. The same girl who called me 'creepy' and told my brother I was a 'creep' tried to seduce me 2 weeks later and tried again 3 months after that when I had broken up with my girlfriend. Girls and women have a different standard or behavior and think about things differently than men do. This is my first lesson to you, do not apply a male standard to females.  You want to be a feminist, then that's up to you. First look up misandry, and consider this in in light of 2 facts. 1. Women think and order their thoughts connectivity. 2. Love and hate are connected in a woman's conscience mind. Yes, it's like that. Creep may be just a response to feeling that you are rejecting them, or they really do find you creepy. There is only one way to find out what temperature the water is and that is to jump in. Take the Kierkegaardian leap of faith and find out by experience which pools of water to avoid.  I never said it was easy but it is the only way to learn. Women know men look all the time, and they expect you to be looking at them, THEY EXPECT IT, anticipate it and send signals with body language what they are thinking. But that is a lesson you can't learn until you have mastered the first one.  Embarrassment and rejection never killed anyone, it's part of the ritual in becoming a man and finding a mate. BTW Your rights stop at other people's noses, but the same is true of them. Sometimes you have to fight for what is yours by right. with men it is a battle of power or strength, but with women it is always a battle of words. You don't want to be like me, I understand women and I proudly am a misogynist, because of that understanding.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Okay, so I am going to reply to some of your points:  War vs Engagement: I've never read either of those books, but the reason why I'd see the one by Homer as better is because of two reasons;  1. War is objectively a more serious topic than marriage and 2. You are pitting the words of a famous ancient Greek philosopher against the words of someone I've never heard of.  Art: For this, I'll share a bit about myself. I'm a mixed race dude with Autism, and I very rarely hear of any media made by Autists. Do I care? No. Why should I? I am not the people who share my traits, and what matters to me is not the traits of the creator, but the traits of the creation. The reason why I don't mind art made by white people is because of all the variation in the traits of their creations.

"Homer is infact empirically better than Jane Austen, because her writing is shit, not because she's a woman.  I've talked books plenty with my mom (who is not only doctorate in English literature, but *gasp!* a woman) and we more or less unilaterally agree that Austen is Autistic and her only good work was her first book Northanger Abbey, not published until after she died. On the other side of the coin, Homer was responsible for multiple works that are by definition literarily great. Aside from his more serious work (that everyone who's attended school during or after his rise in recorded popularity, ~200bce)I would legitimately recommend that you all read Batrachomyomachia, it's a lampooning of his own Iliad, with an army of Mice taking up arms against they tyrannous Frog King.  So no, you weren't sexist for thinking that reading Plain Jane was more of a chore, but it does make you insane when you say that her work can even contend with the more versatile work of the most influential poet of a millennia long empire.

I say this because you mentioned how you seem to think many men may see women this way, which may or may not be the case. Still, I'm not sure how you came to that. From your own personal experience? You don't think perhaps looking or wanting to look has something to do with men being sexually aroused by the visual which is part of man's biological makeup and is therefore natural? It would be unnatural, or perhaps just out of the ordinary, to not look and not be interested in something you find attractive. Curious...

"The ubiquitous white male perspective - the portrayal of things through the 'white rich male' eyes - stems mostly from the fact that these people were creating the content (artworks, movies, books, science, ...) the most. It is much harder to try to put oneself in someone else's shoes, e.g. to think like a black woman when you are a white man. That's why most cultural artifacts in mostly-white cultures show white male perspective. If you go to China or Japan, you won't see white male perspective.  It's not the drive to dominate the culture but rather the result of the distribution of creation of cultural products.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i was wondering for the whole thing if you were joking, until you suggested ignorance of the opposition. it seems absurd to me to think there are guys who leer at women in self indulgence, it comes across as a farce or myth. do some women get stared at? absolutely, but outside of stars and crazys do people at all stare at them? i can't imagine it.  'and all of art is from a white male lens' that is another thing i think is a sincere observation, though i find it disingenuous. yeah men create most of teh art, and most of the municipal capital more generally, and due to writing what authors know characters' thoughts and interpretations of events gender the author. it is why you can tell in harry potter early on the author was a woman, harry just doesn't think like a male. it is a brute fact that most western art was made by men of the west, like most every other public feature. but that isn't an advantage of men, but of women. men get more egocentric confirmation bias in artefacts. women get more similar grooming on an interpersonal level and they can see the framing used natively by men of their society without having to give up similar vulnerability.  most art isn't from a white lens. china, africa, asia (aka middle east), america, there is a very large majority population if you consider these places as creating art. you don't find their art heralded with pride in places they don't belong. conversely, they don't have to accept art from external places either. your claim that most art is by white guys, shows a profound ignorance not of any person beyond yourself. with a change of identity offers an oportunity to accept personal responcibility for personal inititive. you can read the classics of other civilizations and states of the past.    anyway, i'm glad your mind was able to be changed by reading the opposite side's point of view. it implies you hadn't been honestly considering it before. it implies you had decided on which side you were on without a careful consideration of the nuances of the positions. but now with a break from the racist ingroup biases, you can experiance more worldly knowledge, but it is up to you.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Full disclosure I signed the petition.  I didn't really want 'social justice courses' to be removed entirely. I mainly did it to challenge the claim of authority their particular interpretation seems to hold on the entire field. Realistically I knew the petition would never actually accomplish the stated goal. But it would pressure universities to demonstrate the legitimacy of the curriculum by opening it up to more diverse scrutiny.  In its current manifestation, the 'peer review' is heavily biased. Certain aspects of the field are never challenged as no one dare ask (let alone finance a study into investigating) any questions deemed 'politically incorrect'. And the studies that support the existing evidence are largely conducted by groups with serious interest in finding results that support certain conclusions.  I don't consider myself conservative, but I have friends who are and they've provided me with similar experiences to what your describing (though less life changing 180 spins and more individual issues becomming more nuanced). Looking at social justice academia, it's become exactly the sort of unwelcoming hostile enviornment for consevatives that feminists claim the STEM field is to women. Despite pushing for 'divsersity' it ends up with a very one sided biased representation of politically correct liberal activists who LOOK different. We end up losing that. A 'shitlord' can have his mind blown open, but a similar closed minded bigot who just happens to hate the right people (pun intended) can very easily avoid that experience entirely even IF they engage in all the material.  It wasn't the most nuanced fix, but it was the one that had momentum or even the slightest hope of doing SOMETHING.

"To me it was the other way around. College was the first time that I discovered what a cancer feminism is. I was as left leaning as they come, especially as the left in our country makes your left look like our right wing. One of the things I do hold a degree in (believe it or not) is sociology. Pretty early on, I went to a feminist course because I considered myself to be a feminist. Well it was all the dumb bullshit you hear today (apparently I am a sexist because I hold open the door for women, even though I also do that for men). I briefly rediscovered my respect for first and second wave feminism when I did paper on american history, but I also learned that the horrible bullshit that is the cancer of modern feminism already reared it's ugly head in the second wave... to be precise it's what pretty much killed the second wave ('All sex is rape!', anyone?) As for the whole thing about where you cast your eyes... that shit made me cringe. It's a free country and I'll look where ever the fuck I like. I once had a woman pull that crazy shit with me (coincidently it was on the sub platform, too) when I wasn't even looking at her, but simply staring straight ahead. After she had ended her barrage, I told her that the world doesn't revolve around her, gave her the whole free country spiel and ended with how ugly she was and that the only direction people face when she walks in is away from her.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I suppose someone could come along with a type of feminist interpretation saying it supports rape culture or something, but when i read the book i never interpreted Alex as someone to model myself after, he was always an anti-hero (even though i don't even think that is quite the appropriate label for him) but rather almost a villain who i can actually empathize with and see from his perspective the evils of the society at large that he exists within, even though he is not a particularly compassionate or agreeable character he is still, in a certain sense, a victim of the system.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I might be wrong, but I assume pretty much everyone else is doing it, too. I'm not saying you should eye-molest every attractive person who walks by, but I do think it's totally okay to appreciate someone's physical attractiveness, and I don't think that you are by default devaluing the rest of them (though you can't really know more than what they look like from first glance.)

"On Homer v Jane Austin. I know nothing about either but I assume I'd like Homer over Jane because I enjoy subjects of war and conquest then engagement. I guess though you were associating genders with it is why it was sexist?  I don't think preferring war and conquest stories over engagement is anywhere close to sexist. Just what you prefer. However you seem to be indicating that it was a gender thing for yourself.   That video (AA) was meant to be parody with some genuine questions.   Porno uploado. Why??????   Art: I'd hardly think it celebrates anything. Maybe in some ways it does the culture of the group. The romanic group, the greek or perhaps steppe society with what little art we have from them. I think to say their perspective is of some sole group like 'white perspective' is such a disgusting thing to do. Culture is what makes the man if anything not skin color. I think as American you forget how staunchly different whites would view each other or even the history of some skin colors. Its possible Germans are really steppe peoples along with Scandinavia. This idea that its some default reality is strange to me. I for some reason find myself hard to fetter myself to some world view and its hard for me to understand that. On African and Women perspectives I do not believe that their gender or skin color defines some special perspective but some cultural perspective. You seem to forget how different cultures change things. Thats whats actually important not skin color. Your world view seems so narrow to me. So lazered in our own times.   'White male' dominance is simply the product of a culture. Just like 'Chinese male dominance'. 'Steppe women dominance'. These things relegate someone to skin color and its almost racist to me as you go on. Our culture was built upon white male thinkers and people and the ideas of equality of every man and of feminism and so on and so forth came from them within our society and made us(the west) more successful in this era then any other. We are only dominate within our time frame and culture and I think the products of life, love and liberty that have been achieved are huge cultural touch stones for ourselves. This is a first. We've achieved something all of humanity hasn't. So yes it may be saturated but in other points in history other cultures would have been saturated by certain types of people.   Now to the more important point you are alluding to. Should we pay more attention to other cultures and groups.  The short answer is no. Everything must be based upon merit. And I am sorry that in previous society was less of a matriarchy but we can't change that. As time changes society becomes more advanced. This of course is because of the Republican principles and ideas of democracy. Through equality (Lots of whites behind that) everyone has become of equal standing. What should matter is someones content and we can't change society back then and we can't change it now to some weighted system because you loose whats important. The content. What should matter is the content. White men just produced and phe phe'd most things. Just like in 800 BC everyone of importance was either Egyptian or Chinese. It's not indicative of some system its indicative of who was successful within a culture. Keeping a free and clear culture with as little bars as possible is what should be focused on.   As you go on it does seem like you actually were sexist. Jesus christ man.   Legs. Human sexuality. Its not sexist and in fact that lady was a cunt. What's with this puritan mindset? We are impure and amuse things of sexual stimulation. This is simply human nature. A gaze or glance is nothing to feel upset over. In fact to do as she acted was unacceptable in my eyes. Why accost someone for looking at your legs? Of all things...people will look and smile and giggle. This is society and this is human. Boxing ourselves up and looking around nervously is so puritan I get a bit sick. You don't sound like you were being invasive at all. Simply glancing or what have you.   Line I want to key on. Passive object. She is. Just like a man is. Or another person. We are following through as strangers as passive objects. What does it matter where we look and glare? Being hurt by shifts and looks is below human it is childish. It is..irrational. This behavior by the way of someone being vindictive about looks and sights should tell you just what kinda person they are...it seems so basic to me. Who cares who looks and sees? What does it matter? Nothing is dehumanizing or degrading about sexuality. What you say reaks of repression.   The need to bottle up human sexuality will always shock me. Puritans are bad.   I believe you realized the ridiculousness in the following part. However I'm unsure.   Brain washing: I don't believe this is education. I believe this is fundamentally wrong and poisonous. I don't think its education. Its on baseless facts and not given any riggor. I wouldn't mind if it wasn't required for many degrees with nothing to do with it and the banning of conservatives and of other activities I'm sure you know the college campus is anything but a total free market. They need pushed back and held to a higher standard. I'd hardly call that ridiculous. Demanding higher standard for education is not brain washing. I've dealt with the numbers and the arguments and heard from people taking these classes...its safe to assume they need a lot of work. If you simply removed classes like this from being a requirement it'd dissolve the problem itself.   On books and such. Reading these and listening to them and so on and so forth aren't some safe space. many of us wish a open forum for debate. Many of us do this. However on our side people are fired. People are gone after in real life and through legal systems. Take Canada and the take downs of free speech and policing with hate speech. Along with wolf whistling in the UK. Not to mention the entire media having a positive narrative for you guys. At least the major ones bare Fox news. Its not like we haven't heard the points or listened or read. Many of us have and are unchanged and find it bullshit and when finding out what's going on in University demanding better standards and not making it requirements for courses unrelated to it.

"I really liked your video. just one question: Why should I feel bad about looking at goodlooking ladies? I understand that staring long time might be intrusive or annoying but I kinda view it that I have biological urges to reproduce so I am naturally drawn to sexy ladies. I could argue that same goes for woman because I have clearly seen them sometimes seek external validation from men. (i just did a video about it) yet why do I as male get blamed but women get a free pass? if you as feminist don't believe women can objectify men look no further than many controversies coming out of the rio olympics! etc. could it be that as good male feminist you dont feel women have agency or that they are as accountable for their words and deeds as you view men are! How I would have handled that situation you described in the end would be first apologize for any discomfort that girl felt for my objectifying gaze. then explain biology and perhaps ask why she has chosen that attire and makeup not forgetting to complement her looks all the time while talking. Heck since beautiful girl opened me on subway I could not be even tried for misogynidtic hate crime in nottingham so I might even try to pick her up and FUCK her later. you know if she fancies my good looks and vast intellect.

"Several years ago I really liked the term SJW. All the tumblrettes had these cringy descriptions of themselves, and they always added 'Social Justice [something]'. Like: 'Social Justice Paladin', or 'Social Justice Dwarf', etc. So to call them Social Justice Warriors made a lot of sense. A nice term to denote all the whiny teenagers on tumblr. Too bad the term went to complete shit.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"As a shitlord myself, I have always known that perspectives tend to match up with the people writing it. People are naturally selfish in the sense that they view everything from their own perspectives. If we want to change the perspective, or make it more diverse, then it really is up to minorities and women to make that change.   My problem with feminism (generally) was with the people complaining about how nothing is through the perspective of women or blacks but then they do nothing to change it. I am a writer (of stories), and one of the major motivations to write was the fact that I didn't think other people's writing was to my personal liking. My very first instinct was to sit down and write my own stuff in an attempt to change novels for the better. This is why it irks me when someone comes along and just plays the critic. Anyone can complain, but only the best can actually make the change.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"In my experience, you can't have the kind of humor that you display in these videos and be an SJW.  At least not one with any real awareness of what that pejorative means.  None of the things you brought up seem to be points most self-identifying anti-SJWs on youtube actually take any issue with.  Anyone to the left of Hitler?  Where is that from?  Is it not possible, in your view, to take identity politics and political correctness too far, especially merely for the purposes of personal validation rather than any coherent internal conviction?  Let me give you a taste-- You're wearing a dress?!... to be edgy?....'exotic'? ... why are you mocking transgender women?  Why are you appropriating part of their appearance without truly adopting the lifestyle?  Do you think alcoholism is funny?  It's a disease!  What are you doing to that ham?  You didn't give a single trigger warning first.  Don't you realize what some victims of sexual abuse have been through?...

"On the note of Gender Studies courses and Social Justice curriculum, I have to agree with some points and disagree on others, on the one hand, I don't think Gender Studies courses are all on mass intentionally indoctrinating kids into some crazy cult, that much I feel is obvious, however I attended school in Oregon, which is a decently 'progressive' state, and 'Social Justice & Diversity' was one among the required classes required to be taken as part of prerequisites, there were some other classes you could take optionally like 'Power & Imagination' but they were very few and you were lucky to get in one given the actual volume of students trying to opt out of Social Justice, I was required to take this class for a term, and the entire time the class consisted of arbitrarily defining a system and then that week each student would write a paper on how that system or concept has occurred in their lives or affected their life in some way, it was essentially the definition of listen and believe, defining systems of power on faulty logical constructs. This all being said, I do agree to some degree with the proposition that art has historically been from the male perspective, with I think is being remedied slightly as our society continues, but it should also be noted that men respond more positively to sexually provocative imagery, whereas women more positively respond to descriptions or erotic writing, which could also to some degree explain the excess of imagery dedicated to the female form, Writing is still art, it just takes more time to consume, there could very well be quite dated erotic writings, and I actually personally find the topic interesting now that I think about it.  Edit: Great video as always by the way.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I wonder what the rationale for premise that 'most of art in European history is from the *perspective* of rich white men.'  I mean, do rich white men really have such a unique view of the world, which is so different to people of other races and genders, that whatever art they have produced is alienating? Do black men for example find 18th century paintings of plump white females alienating?  I just don't get the idea that we are supposedly so different, because of social factors or cultural circumstance.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"You got caught looking at some woman's legs and got made to feel guilty about it? You're kidding right? That's pathetic. You couldn't just look her in the eye and say 'Yea, I was looking. Nice legs.' And if she's got an attitude, add: 'You have a problem with that?'  You must hang out with a nasty class of feminist women because usually when women see me looking they just nod and smile at me, or make that other visual judgement and stick up their nose while they walk by.  If you're being made to feel guilty because you look at women, then yes, it's brain washing, not education.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I agree that most people today see white men as the default, but that isn't the fault of white men today. we're just doing our thing and others look in from an outside perspective and see us as the default. the problem is that most 'sjw' based movements point out this propensity to see white men as the default and instead of blaming themselves for allowing themselves to fall into this trap, they blame us, like that's what we wanted them to see. it isn't The other problem is that 'sjws' don't correct this by fighting this misconception and replacing it with a 'we are equally default' nerrative, but instead reinforce the 'white men are default' nerrative and try to defeat white men instead of defeating the narrative that's why I hate terms like PoC and Coloured people, because both terms assume white is the default race. I want for this whole perspective to die, and so do many others,  bit the problem I see with 'sjw' culture is too many people want to imply that because they themselves see white as the default they project that onto white men and use this nerrative to break white men down when their goal should be to build other people up. I see the current climate as misdirected and even an over correction sorry if this didn't make sense... I'm delirious with fever","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The reason I fell in love with you Contra is because I saw you as this bridge between petty feminists who complain about manspreading and cultural appropriation and the anti-feminists who reject all of feminism simply because it's feminism. However, in this video you're ultimately showing your petty feminist side. It does not matter if you stare at a women's legs and she says you're a creep. As a gay man I do the same thing, but with men. I know women who do too. We all do. We all admire attractive people, and much of the time we do so without acknowledging their humanity. This is okay as we're not harming them. If we reject their humanity to the point where we harass or assault them, then yes, you have a point. Barring that though, objectification is a two-way street. Regarding media's default being that of a white mans perspective, how so? Sure, most of what you see in Ways of Seeing falls in line with what you're saying. Society has evolved though.
