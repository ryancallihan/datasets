Thank you for not spending the next four years in a numbly ignorant bubble of drugs and white privilege.
The image of a miner for trump in this video was also posted by the Russian IRA group as an ad in the USA before the election. It‚Äôs in the mueller report
2:29 "Constraints." Oh, to be so young and naive once more.
* 1:00 - AUGH! I NEED BRAIN BLEACH! [Proceeds to fill brain with images of kitties, young Syd Barrett and 'The Golden Twink' (who I treat as a separate character since Natalie isn't a guy).] * As for the vast list of HOW that Orange weirdo got into the White House ('How The Fuck Did This Happen?') I say "ALL OF THE ABOVE". It was a rare fluke Perfect Storm!
Queridos camaradas brasileiros, isso n√£o parece familiar?
And then there is the UK fuckery. Three years after they voted to leave the EU and we still can't work out what's happening.
Subtitles!
Your Marxist lens prevent you from understanding Ayn Rand. We ain't in for the money, we're in for the happiness.
you simply could not see all of this as a gamer your view was too sophisticated
hello sjews
Two and a half years later, this is a really interesting listen... particularly the part where you predict that since he's now "the establishment", his supporters will begin to blame him for the things he does.
This is the best explanation on the internet.
Super weird, I just played Brahms 1st symphony 4th movement before this vid and it ended with that, spooky. Also 2019 gang what‚Äôs up the world is still on fire
A pro Trump add played before this video.....
I'm more of an old leftist.  I'm of the opinion that 90% of issues pertaining to race/gender/sexuality will be resolved if we get economic justice, and I see too many goddamn neoliberals cynically using identity politics to derail campaigns for economic justice.  I've even seen articles written to try to argue that Medicare for all is racist or something to that effect.
Love ya, but I'm not sure why you were surprised Trump won since you shared a clip of TYT... they foreshadowed a possible win from as early as the Democratic convention, which was a clusterf*ck.  I mean, how could she win when anyone who mentioned her was almost booed off the stage... the convention isn't just filled with anyone off the street, they were delegates... loudly protesting Hillary on the floor and even moreso outside.   I was in mourning when Hillary's nomination was official because I didn't think she would win... so much that I was hoping something unfortunate would happen to her to give someone else the nomination.
Let's overthrow the government.
Just putting up Dave Chapelle‚Äôs face doesn‚Äôt give reasonable explanation of what he said.
BTW Natalie, no matter which body you inhabit or how you identify, I have a huge crush on your brain.
So I recently saw a talk from last year where you said you can't stand to watch your old videos or hear your old voice, so I don't know if you'll ever see this, but I just wanted to say I have been watching your old videos and I LOVED this one so much, I sent it to my mom and she was so impressed.  She texted me, "Wow that video was utterly amazing.  How can people so smart not get their stuff to a wider audience." I told her to like it and share it with all her friends.  For context, my mom is a 70 year old Jew who basically taught my daughter (who is now 8 but was 6 at the time) about how awful Trump is, to the point that my daughter Boos the Trump Hotel every time we pass it on the freeway (we live in Vegas).
In NZ me and my fam followed the election pretty closely. Was utterly, thoroughly gutted. This affects us all.
You know, I study (used to) politics formally and follow it almost religiously and this has got to be the best breakdown I‚Äôve seen yet
Watching this three years after your posting... your reasoning is/was exactly right
I got a trump ad in front of this smh
Turns out he‚Äôs still their and the straight white men are still sucking his dick
NATTY BOHHHHHHH
Just as LBJ was the end of FDR liberalism. I believe that Trump is the anti-thesis to Reagan conservatism. A new party system will slowly grow out of the dying sixth party system. A new era will establish itself after the end of the Reagan era.
"...shitting..." LOL so very LOL
This is kind of apropos of nothing but whoever painted that picture at 9:49 has never tried to lift a an outboard motor :-p
Bernie didn‚Äôt win the nomination because the DNC was never going to let him win, and he didn‚Äôt fight against their rigging of the process.. Bernie is an independent who ran as a democrat, and the DNC could not allow that. There was so much cheating and corruption.
The average annual salary of Drumpf voters was $70k. How is that white working class tilting the scale? Yes, many wwc did vote for him, and I disagree with them. But the Dems did not speak to class concerns sufficiently,  nor did HRC visit the Rust Belt states. She was a terrible and polarizing candidate. Thank you for pointing  out that wwc are not solely to blame. I love, love, love your channel!!!!
I feel a little unhappy about how much Natalie used to poke fun at Anita Sarkesian I know that she's interviewed her since and they seem to be on good terms. It would be nice if people apologized for the shit they did when they were/are inundated with male hormones
this is another hit, rock on
B-B-Buuuttt I wanna rrrriiioooottt!
Why does Satan sound like Richard Dawkins?
Well we survived another year. So close to the 2020 elections. Clench your asses we‚Äôre about there
I got an ad that‚Äôs an ‚Äúupdate‚Äù for the wall on the border. It‚Äôs just a slightly upgraded fence. And they‚Äôve finished about a half mile, only 1,953.5 miles to go. I almost forgot they wanted to build a wall, no one talks about it anymore
I grant that this is a cogent analysis.
In the thumbnails diagram the old left is on the left and the new left is on the right....Seems legit.
Did you say ‚Äú relatively few misdeeds‚Äù of Hillary?....lol
I like to think of America as a house filled with a big family (at like a reunion or something).  We are a big house that's falling apart except for one small room. We have a bunch of vaping teenagers, toddlers addicted to watching stuff they are way to young to watch, a bunch of drug addicts and the family does keep getting bigger, ya that one fifth cousin will stay good through all this but no one else will
10:14 thats because racism has been a harder and longer struggle than the white enititled rights.
I got a trump ad before this video....
Too much emotion
He won because of memes
I like to say, if they retreat in moral argument, they will retreat in war.
Why Italian?
Love your Italian pronounciation. It‚Äôs one of the most correct ones I‚Äôve heard used by an American in a very long time.   Anyway I don‚Äôt go here so whatever, my opinion is irrelevant.

But... marmite is amazing
Down with trump, hail satan
Living in south Mississippi, you quickly realize how white folks think that Blacks, Hispanics, LGBT, Non-Christians, Slooty Woman and anything requiring taxes are the blame for America's struggles. Anything not Cis-het Christian Conservatism is viewed as the Josef Satan.
"Say but again, motherfucker, and I will send you to Kane." "I been meaning to talk to him anyway." "He's been meaning to talk to you." "Well, you tell your friend Kane, I don't suck no horse's dick." "No one's asking you to." "Horses can suck their own dicks." "No they can't." "Well, they should." "Just don't say but, alright?" "Alright... Alright."
That's a good Satan quote. Not that I know others to compare it to. But it's a good quote. And I just said the word 'but', which means two or three more times and it'll seem like I  should use the word but again, only maybe I'll accidentally misspell it. But?
You said bernie didn't win partly because he lacked appeal to black and hispanic voters. Evidence all points to corporate democratic establishment using the super delegates monopoly to block him, also the primaries were rigged. These factors are the biggest ones.
The argument that Sanders failed to gain the black vote is a bit of an exaggeration. Polls show that Sanders was consistently more popular among all young minority groups than Hillary or Trump. Granted, the key word here is 'young' as in under 30 years old.
It's now 2019, and as an older cis dude, it is amazing to see that Natalie was totally male only 2 1/2 years ago!
cgp grey's video on the electoral college is very informative.
"Now is he the esbatlishment and people will blame him" It¬¥s sad, but that¬¥s not really what happend. Is it funny or sad that we in Germany have a sentence for this "Wenn das der F√ºhrer gewusst h√§tte"...
Watching this in 2019 I can confirm... his supporters have NOT started blaming him for all the fuckups.
15:09 that's aged well :/
16:51 I like how just 10 months later you went from ‚Äòdown with Trump, hail Satan‚Äô to ‚Äòdeath to Capitalism, hail Satan‚Äô
What happened with Dave Chappelle?
16:31 What is the audio from?
9:40 - "anyone can be wealthy and successful, as long as you work hard enough" - comes from christian individualism, I do believe it to be too ingrained into that white christian culture, rather than implying they are just political tools to ward off socialism
"DOWN WITH TRUMP! HAIL SATAN!"ü§òü§£
wow wow wow.... are you saying Hillary didn't threaten to commit war crimes? I mean you can only say that if you acknowledge that she had already committed them.
15:23 You were far too optimistic. The lengths conservatives are going to defend their fuhrer is vile.
got the weirdest like PUA ad on this video, like if PUA techniques were aimed at women getting guys.....
This was surprisingly correct for the most part.
15:01 surprise bitch, he did
Bernie 2020. Me not American.
Vote Satan 2020
Hello sJews (SJWs) brilliant.
All predictions correct.
shitlords. #Hindsight2020.
I'll never understand why black voters went with Clinton over Sanders. Shit makes 0 sense
I‚Äôm sorry but can I just say that I legit don‚Äôt really give a shit about other people and I don‚Äôt want to pay for everyone to be equal because if you don‚Äôt deserve it, you shouldn‚Äôt have it.... and no one else should have to act or pretend like they do cause ‚Äúit‚Äôs the right thing to do.‚Äù No... it‚Äôs every person and family for themselves. Don‚Äôt get me wrong; I have feelings and it sucks people are suffering.... BUT IT‚ÄôS NOT MY JOB. Charity should NOT be mandatory. I work for what I have and I get 0 hand outs. I can barely afford food. Yet my taxes go to people who I KNOW don‚Äôt deserve it. I get being disabled, I‚Äôll help them out all day long. However, if you live in poverty and have 7 children and spend your money on flat screens, tattoos, nails and drugs....... you AND your kids can go fuck yourselves. This world is over populated anyways. Sorry not sorry. Stay away from my money. (I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump‚Äîhe‚Äôs a dumb fuck, but I know why people did. Fuck socialism and communism. If we ever get that bad, I think I‚Äôll kill myself.)
Oh please, I detest this notion that the left just straight up abandoned the white working class. The truth is, we negotiated endlessly with them. We advocated to institute government retraining programs and they didn't want to hear any of it. Obama fucking saved the middle class from a recession and bailed out the auto-industry ffs, and these bastards still had the audacity to demonize him. The truth is, the white working class are just a bunch of narcissistic, self-important, ungrateful douchebags who fuck shit up for everyone, including themselves, then they want to come cry to us to clean up the mess they created, then we do, and then they spit in our faces and act like we never did anything for them. We've ALWAYS tried to take them into consideration, meet them in the middle, and give them a helping hand, and they always throw us onto the ground and kick us. They wanted to throw us under the bus to get theirs, well now that bus is making a U-turn.
I responded to turmp becomeing president with a massive data dive into order to understand Why.  3 yaers of research in to Political science Pycolage Sociology History Perasocial pycolage Mida manipulation And may more topics i found my answers. The real reason of the how and why only to find out no one chairs.  Saddly that same data shows turmp remaining in offices unless the Democrats change tactics and have a ecstramly strong candidate.
Imagine if ContraPoints had stayed asleep the last few years. So much has changed for her.  I wouldn't mind more basic political videos from her Tbh.
that ending.. that has to be the most effectively deployed satanic quote i've ever seen.
Hi from the future, you underestimated the centrist democrats royally fucking things up almost every step, but hey at least there's a strong movement to replace most of them getting some solid victories. So at least there's that.
Surprised you don't understand the electoral college system. It balances population disparities between more urban and more rural states, to put it simply. Your analysis is pretty on point otherwise.
Now we are feeling the same despare in Brazil. A completely idiot, racist, sexist, agressive to minories and LGBTs has been elected and is doing all the bad stuff but still has a large group who support him, bankers and big farmers, and working class, oh shit, here we go again.. heil Satan!
00:00 hey bernie4lyfe
Hail Satan, indeed
On the bright side trump hadn‚Äôt done much yet
Combined with other means of action, rioting is effective.
16:30 what is this from
Would love to see an update to this heading into 2020. Pretty concerned that his next campaign slogan will be ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs no collusion you‚Äôve gotta vote for me... roosion (sic)‚Äù. And I‚Äôm scared that will work.
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL I love uuuuuu
got an impeach trump ad before the video
me, before the election: guys vote in the caucuses for bernie!!!!!  democrats: eh, he‚Äôll never win.   the polls: actually, he‚Äôd win against trump!  hillary: wins the democratic nomination  trump: **wins the presidency**
@7:00 Would you kinly explain the "white man already finding himself defensive about your imply that Trump supporters are racist" how progressivism without identity politics is lopsided and inadequate?  I, for one, loathed Hillary more than Trump. And although I am a sincere marxist (ie in the true sense of the word: I believe in class warfare and advocate for considerable wealth distribution to mitigate the snowballing effect of unchecked capitalism) ... I do not see how faking admiration for women, black people and homosexuals (for the sole achievement of being female, black or homosexual in a time and place where it has NEVER been so easy in the entire history of mankind) is getting us any closer to the end goal of actual social justice. You know, that old dumb racist white-man-theorized bullshit about economic dignity, access to decent free medicine and education, etc.  I'm gonna watch the end of the video now, just in case you address that. But I have to tell you, I have very little faith. Because most of your identity politics type are usually content pulling out of thin air that the former requires the latter, without any other examination than "French theory by existentialist philosophers said so in the 60s and academia in a few west-coast campuses concurred".  I think the opposite. I think if most leftist progressives would extend an olive branch to their actual brothers (such as I, whom you'd probably call a white supremacist misogynist or something), and focus on actually bringing some sort of marxist achievement (even something small, perhaps, to start with: state regulations of the cost of education, before we get to free federal nation-wide colleges) instead of rambling on and on about the hundreds gender identities and pronouns we're supposed to give a fuck about... ... we could actually do something. Something tangible, something good, something people could enjoy, something that could bring them to the idea you do not have to be a raving bolshevik to think billionaires who collect yachts they don't even sail can be made to participate so people wouldn't have to choose between bankruptcy and literal untreated cancer. And calling every white heterosexual guy part of the problem is killing the economic left in my opinion.
YEP! And World Wide Web to stick it all together
We were right when trump won the election. He has fucked this country up almost to the point of no return.
Surprisingly cogent 2 years on. well done
me tryna figure out if girl contra is hotter than dude contra.
Sssssssjews
I enjoyed this video.
I am a balloon.
3 years and you still don't get it you liberals are really retarded.
You just gave me an inspiration for my work. Thank you. BTW: you are a great, funny, extremely intelligent woman, please keep doing your work! üí™üèæ‚ù§Ô∏è
Your Trump impression is spot on!
DOn't forget- the left literally supports non-American workers. The white worker replacements.
Yet the orange goblin is fucking up every single fucking day and still no one has kicked his shriveled old braggart ass out of the white house.
If only I had seen this video before and translated it to Portuguese... well, Brazil would have still been murdered, but, by editing out the last minute, maybe I would've helped?
"People will blame him when things go wrong"  Oh I wish that were true.  Nope it's 2019 and it's STILL Obama's fault or Mexicans' fault.    Ugh, Trump and his voters suck.
First time on ContraPoints. Bravo, well played, great points, and funny. Glad Vox sent me here.
_Hello SJWs_
If you're white and a liberal in America in early in November 2016 yes you were probably surprised Trump won the election...
"Constraints conventional republicans will place on him" with a picture of McConnell and Ryan. That bit didn't age well lol
Its, uh, the United STATES of America, not United America. I don't want New England and California to control every presidential election.   I've been watching all your vids and every opinion you have is basic bitch Reddit tier. It doesn't take much to understand the electoral college.
I think this was a fairly good video but you forgot to adres the fact that Trump also received votes from minority groups as well. People say it is because they have been brainwashed however that is not really a deduction made by a rigorous analysis.
And, here we are :s
Would you look at that, trump fucked things up.
Oh dear prepare yourself for ‚Äúorange man bad‚Äù
‚Äú Hail Satan‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Honestly the biggest reason people voted Trump is because enough people hated Hillary and what she represented.  Many Bernie supporters felt betrayed by the DMC, and the fact that nobody better than Hillary represented the Democratic party just made her the face of everything that was wrong politically.  I wouldn't judge too harshly people who voted for Trump.  Trump was a hope for a change to the political system itself, a small hope, but a hope nonetheless.
You know how there's this obnoxious American stereotype? Well, the personification of that stereotype sits in office and it went about how you'd think.
excuse me, Hilary won because the DNC stole the election ****
Wow! This was such a great predictor of what happened. I am becoming more and more of a fan of this Chanel.
Communists are considered far left,just like neo Nazis are considered far right.....
"Capitalism was propped up by the American Dream"... Yeah, but the Cold War was arguably more important.  An actual existential threat does wonders for propping up the powers that be.  And inspiring a lot of great music.  PS: What is with all you young-uns (and lots of old-farts) forgetting about the Cold War?  I grew up after "duck and cover" was universally recognized as bullshit and when newspapers occasionally published maps showing where Soviet nukes were likely targeted.  Talk about angst inducing conditions. (FWIW: My childhood home would have been in the "totally destroyed" area of like 4 different high-priority targets...)  PPS: That Satan guy is a great speaker.  Maybe we could nominate them in 2020?
BTW. WTF does the Weimarer Republic 19-33 (2. Reich) has to do with Socialism or Nazism? please get your facts right. also the Reich is no reference to Hitler, the Reich ended in 1919...... that is why it is called the 3. Reich....  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire
nobody votes al bundy because he thinks he will be a good President but outta pure and honest dispair :)
Trump: "all mexicans are rapists"  also Trump: "grab em by the pussy"
i hate the electoral college. its so stupid and undemocratic and the whole goddamn reason we got in this stupid ugly situation in the firsr place. fuck the electoral college.
Who else is watching this from 2019! Wooo!  Still no wall.
Aside while watching: I absolutely believe in the American Dream (or really, the inherent American privilege), as a black man, from my perspective of knowing the Polish nightmare of a good friend.  My mother's generation immigrated to America from the West Indies. For the most part, my mother succeeded entirely through her own merits, and that was without any sort of university degree or vocational schooling. My dad's done fine. My older sister, who has an African-sounding name and had to struggle the most of my family as the first born daughter has the highest salary of anyone I personally know by a long shot, is immensely respected in her field, and is still progressing all through hard work.  Then you have me and my younger sister. We were basically layabouts in comparison, had very little drive or motivation, but ultimately found stable careers with room for growth mostly thanks to American systems in place, and the value of "an American" in the realm of education in foreign nations. All in all, I consider myself to be one of the most privileged people I've been personally aware of, and KNOW that hard work and a good position can get you everything--and really, it's mostly the latter rather than the former. Meanwhile, my friend in Poland has always exerted about 20 times the effort I have, but Poland is a goddamn disaster. Although he speaks and understands English better than myself, since he's not American or British or Canadian learning English from him would be less desirable (unfair though that may be). Though he has the requirements to become a professor or something else in Poland, Poland's education system is defensive of old blood and reluctant to add new teachers, leaving him to need to find work in something completely unrelated. He worked a lot harder than I did for years, and I basically found an "in" to his desired career path in a single month, all because of my American benefits.  It's not easy for all blacks, it's not easy for all whites, but for better or worse, you can indeed achieve the American Dream.
Coming from the present of 2019 It was all so much worse than anyone could have expected  We were so much more fucked than anyone could have reasonably expected
I think a lot of it did have to with Bernie Sanders losing the Democratic Nomination. I really wanted him to win.
I wish everyone saw this video after the election ...
This is a brilliant breakdown, even (maybe especially) two years later. I come for the costumes, cinematography and self-deprecating humor and stay for the analysis.
15:07 your prediction of "I dare him to build fucking wall" was also a bit optimistic
Your video editing seems to be inspired by visual politics channel. Anyways love the video, it's interesting to look at it in hindsight
Here in 2019 lol
Create a failed state, reap the indignation
Two years late and I can confirm that Trump is an awful president
Trump now literally holds the government hostage and his fans, zealots, still sing his praises.  FUCK TRUMP and his fans!
a message from the future!! it was Russia...j/k but ya it was them
"Don't riot"  *Tabby hisses*
We are screwed. This is future leftist and he just shut down the government for a month over the wall and gutted the ACA. We have a little less than 2 more years of this lunacy. May FSM help us all or kill us, whatever just make it stop.
always love a shout out
I somehow still hope Eric Idle is going for president. He's just a nice old man.
And fuq the women's march. Until they get rid of Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour for their anti-semitism, I will never support them. If it were 2 white women who attended a richard Spencer talk, they would absolutely be kicked out of the movement. But since its a black woman and a muslim woman being racist towards white Jews, lets just ignore it. The left has completely isolated us and thats why so many Jews are becoming conservstive.
He does not point fingures at Jews. There is an argument to be made for the other groups you listed. Name one offense he has msde against Jews. He has only supported us. His daughter and grandchildren are Jewish. He has put his Jewish son in law in charge of many issues and has supported Israel completely. You have no argument for him disliking Jews.
Actually, some who disagree with you are not white men. Im a Jewish woman. I am not a Trump fan but he does not hate women and minorities.
Wow. His hair color had some violent swings. How does that fluorescent yellow even happen?
15:21 If only you knew.
I wish I could show this to my mother-in-law but the swearing and the Satan stuff is a non-starter. No shade. I love everything you do.
Anyone else get an ad of trump asking you to sign a petition for the border wall on this video? Lmao
Hey fuck you Natalie! Marmite is awesome!
15:08 Watching this 3 weeks into the government shutdown... Now I'm sad
15:16 - how wrong you were lol.
Shit. This analysis is fucking spot on. Why didn't youtube show me contrapoints sooner? waaaaaaa
Sarah Kendziors "The view from flyover country" is a good look at why Americans voted the way they did and what needs to change so it doesn't happen again.
I got a Trump ad right before thisü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
This analysis has stood up remarkably well two years on.
I much prefer today's leftist Natalie to 2016's  'woke' liberal  Nate.
12:18 Bernie didn‚Äôt ‚Äúappeal‚Äù to non-white voters because he wasn‚Äôt given the platform to become well-known to communities more isolated from national politics and the states with more non-white voters went early. After the election, he polled better than Hillary with non-white voters but by then her previous influence had allowed her to coast to the nomination.
I like Contra, but I don't fully understand her fascination with Anita Sarkeesian. I know most of it is played for comedic purposes, but I find Anita sometimes not as logically rigorous as needed when discussing some topics. Contra, on the other hand, is fairly logical and tends to not leave loose ends in her arguments. I'd love for her to do a video on Sarkeesian.
Hopefully a native American runs for president in 2020,like come on, how fucking awesome would that be
"I dare him to build that FUCKING wall" eeek
Yeah, completely ignore the fact that the DNC fucked Sanders like a pretty altar boy. The fact that Clinton almost lost the primary to a "socialist" Jew who nobody heard of before that primary shows just how much better of a candidate Sanders was.
i got an ad asking to sign a petition on the wall... How is this still a problem.
Still glad Hillary didn‚Äôt win.
You should do an update on Trump at the midterms. Like 4 years of trump and react to the thoughts in this video.
It's 2019 now and the wall issue is reaching it climax. Scary as shit because at this point his supporters don't care about him promising them that Mexico will pay for it as long as it gets done. They don't care about him not making due on his promises. His lawyer Cohen got sent to prison and has testified that he's done dirty deeds for Trump and his supporters are just as loud and obnoxious, mostly stating that these are all Democratic ploys and false smear tactics to take down Trump. Evidence doesn't matter anymore. Even if he were found guilty of crimes from the Mueller investigation, his base will willfully ignore it and revolt like Trump said. It's true, Trump can shoot a person in the middle of time square and his supporters will still follow him. I'm starting to lose faith in the American people now.  But the good news though: Democrats have the House now, hopefully they can subpoena him and get him to release his tax returns. But like I said above, even if he is impeached for Conspiracy and conflicts of interest in business dealings, his voter base WOULD NOT CARE. As long as they can express their hatred towards democrats, minorities, immigrants, gays, jews, trans, and give back political power and dominance of the majority of white males and white women who identify with that rhetoric and tradition. That is all they care about.
God dammit though. Trump's shutting down the gov't to get his stupid wall.  Blah.
And now we know bernie was never given a fair chance. Hope he runs next time
Hi Big fan of ContraPoints but something bothers me:  At some point of the video, it is stated that the average Trump voter earns around 70k a year - and in the second part of the video, the election of Trump is explained by the fact that college students and factory workers don't earn enough money to make it, so they elect this mongolian to shake things up.  That is contradictory I think.  If anybody can point something that I haven't understood, or agrees with me, that would be great, because I currently feel (mistakenly, I hope) that this makes the argument of the video crumble.
You were wrong about many things, For instance, black unemployment is at an all time low. Trump 2020. Eat shit
So the idea that trump emboldened hate crimes against minorities is dead wrong. The FBI report released at the end of 2016 shows that there was a 5% increase in hate crime from 2015 but that most of crime in that increase were anti-white hate crimes. Trump didn‚Äôt normalize attacking minorities if anything the practice of attacking white people based on the color of their skin was normalized. I doubt anyone will read this but if you want links to the stats please let me know.
I was with you up until "despare." Dang. Love the channel, though. Just can't remember if I'm DaBigHotChocolate, or simply David Michael Philip Smith. I'm a Patron, I guess, so I just want the raw thrill of seeing my name in the list of such.
Stop speak Italian.
the electoral college isnt that bizarre speaking as an icelander (granted we have a similar system) all it does is give more power to the few to balance out the many, if memory serves new york city alone has more people living in it then the 3-5 smallest states (depends on whether you count states like north and south carolina as a single state or not) if the electoral college wasnt there fuck the rest of the country i would just campaign in like the three or four biggest cities and call it a day the rest of the country couldnt really compete now at least the 51% majority cant just ignore the 49% minority
>peaceful protest Ah contrapoints was so innocent
And as for blue collar workers "voting against their own self-interest" . . . they don't see liberals as job creators. Gone is that image of support for labor/unions. So they push their kids to go to college, and after graduating they have to move back home into their parents' basement.
Voters that previously voted for Obama and then voted for Trump were the deciding factor along with Dems that don't trust Hellary. The banks that screwed Americans and flooded the global markets with subprime securities support both parties. (bailout) Corporations that pollute our bodies (so that we need so much health care), stifle small businesses, dodge taxes and refuse to pay enough of a living wage to pay off (student) debt also support both parties. There is no amount of influence the Russians can have that is greater than these facts.¬†  Identity politics undermines democracy when those you identify with still don't act in your economic interest, no matter Dem or Repub. Identity politics actually serves as a detraction from economic issues.  The crazy crap Trump does is so you are no looking at the traditional right-wing economic policies as much. Bernie was just a border collie for the sheep. He was never intended to win the nomination; the Clintons were the chosen ones.  I don't care whether the leaked emails came from. I only care if those emails reveal the truth. Bill & the Donald both are horrible to women, but Dems don't talk about that. I cringe that people choose to be so politically naive.
I‚Äôll let you put my sub prime loan into your mortgage backed CDO with a credit default swap attached ;)
Can we stop for a moment and recognize our countries president is a dead meme
This video was prescient.
Hail Satan!
We didn't start the fire
9.15 the distinction you draw between socialism and fascism, literally describes the 'new left' as fascist in nature.
Hey it would be cool to have a pt. 2 from after the midTerms and how his presidency has affected the country
2:14 trump rekt 8:45 contrapoints says that smart capitalists who don't want to be guillotined tend to be liberals intent on stabilizing the system to prevent the revolt of those being screwed over. 10:19 for anyone baffled at why trump beat clinton. also, start watching The Young Turks and you'll understand quickly.
Incorrect analysis of why Bernie lost the primaries. It's called super delegates. 12:20
well, this aged confusingly!
That big dip in manufacturing jobs in 2001 was largely due to China being admitted into the WTO and gaining most favorable nation status despite that they do not do anything they agreed to. There were some other factors of course but that was probably the most significant. I can get into the subprime crisis as a result of poor management of the dot com bubble by the fed, and yes the deregulation measures you mention, but I'm lazy.  I absolutely hate Trump with one exception. It takes a fascist to talk to a fascist(the Chinese). Anyways I voted for the green party in an extremely blue state. Hillary was also a fascist, a much more covert one, so there really was no good choice in my opinion. If I had a preference it was Trump because the Left seemed to be falling asleep under Obama. The left is gaining membership everytime Trump speaks. Granted so are the less covert fascists but sometimes it takes extremes to make things happen. Also yeah call china out on their bullshit please, thanks.  I don't know why the west has become so complacent about a government that oppresses minorities and harvests organs from a peaceful group with millions of members that likes to meditate in parks. You think the US is bad. Take a good hard look at China.
This was what I was feeling with Brexit. Both times I fell asleep thinking logic amd non-racism would prevail. I was wrong.
Why didn't you mention the rigging against bernie in the democratic primary? That's what made me unable to hold my nose and vote for queen establishment
Trump helping working class more than all commies of a world helped 1 worker... Combined
I can't even begin to explain how much I love you, Natalie!
I can tell you why Hillary lost. She has been so corrupt for so long and Americans finally realized it. You should really look into a Arkansas while Bill was governor. ADFA, funding the Iran Contras, shipping in thousands of pounds of cocaine and murder. Oh and not to mention that Hillary opposed gay marriage for most of her life, she views young inner city black men as super predators and she got a pedophile off and then laughed about it. She probably knew about Seth Rich's murder along with John Podesta. Her daughters father is Webster Huebbell (look it up). She knew about Benghazi and she did nothing, even going so far as to cover it up and call it a "protest". She's a murderer and a liar and a coward.
I don't disapprove but what's with the accurately pronounced Italian in the counting of the  chapters? I gotta say it's extremely refreshing to see an American Youtuber who actually gives a shit about getting pronunciations of words in foreign languages right.
<3 4:30
if the dnc elects biden, we get 4 more years of trump. if they elect bernie, we get bernie. calling it now
you mention HST as I talk to a friend about how HST was a great political theorist based
Contrapoints...I think I love you.
Trump won because republicans had the seats in congress to elect him. 306 electoral votes Shocker thats just how many seats republicans had in congress during the election. Trump didn't win because he was anti-pc he won because 306 republicans in congress which has the lowest approval rating in history of any democratic country elected him.
Petty? Like misgendering?
lol you wanted Hillary? i find it hard to respect people who vote for ruthless neocolonialists.
0:15 I don't get it... That's a usual Tuesday night for Australians
Marmite is BRITISH. You are Fake News.
I know this is a two-year-old video but relevant point- the generation coming of age in the era of ridiculous student loan debt and not being able to pay it off presents a unique conundrum. While the cost of college is prohibitively high and paying it off is difficult, many are electing not to pursue higher education. However while some are able to secure careers that do not necessitate education or a degree this leaves some people without the criteria to get higher paying and less physically strenuous jobs that education is supposed to help people get. Also, many entry level jobs (although not all) entail tedious unfulfilling work that is often taxing on the body and can result in overuse injuries. It is up to this generation to decide how they're going to make living for selves. While I totally endorse people who are happy finding work without college or other education, I resent the right wing ideologues guilting and shaming young people for Desiring a different route
10:06 You forget the red scare side of it too, collective bargining being for moscow stooges and all that.
Does average wage work as a metric for Trump's base if we assume there are a huge portion of the 1% that vote Republican? Would median work better?
Omg, I just realized Trump is a human Gish Gallop...
>one of the biggest Jew supporters in America >his daughter converted to judaism Yea, I can totally see Trump pointing fingers at Jews.
2018 hears you say the thing about ... well, all of it and wonders how you feel about it now... we've been pretty fucked, no one bought us dinner, allowed us cake, and now we are hoping the blue slow roll midterm wave will be enough to hold us up for a while.
I think to tell people to not riot who identify themselves as socialists, who are rioting as the stepping stones for a revolution, is quite neoliberal to say. I mean, unless it comes from a genuine safety concern then I understand, but it comes from an ideology of ‚Äòhow to change the government‚Äô, violence of the people has been the only way systems of oppression have been destroyed.
How did this happen? Hillary was just about the most unlikeable candidate ever, except Trump. So all the crazy people who like Drump were able to win because much of the rest of the voting public didn't like her and she just kinda assumed she was going to win and ran a lazy ass election, especially in the midwest. It was hardcore amateur hour and she fucked us all by fighting against Bernie, who had an actual movement of support behind him, people that would have gone out to vote. I voted, but it made me sad when I voted for her, I dislike her a great deal, the whole thing set me against voting ever again. I'd vote to eliminate representational govt but that's not happening so why bother participating? The entire thing is based on trust, I have no trust left.    I'm going to ignore most of politics from now on and do what I can to help the world with gardening. Remind people there are reasons to live, that the world they live on is alive and that we need it to live and by taking the reins of our lives we can make these fucktards less important. The most powerful people in the world still do not have any actual power beyond that within their own bodies. They are surrounded by people who continuously give their power to the system that gives that person so much focused power. All it takes is some disgruntled security agent to snap and down goes fucktard in some murder-suicide funtime. I bet the AI thing will blow up and make the entire political/social structure we have go poof so the entire idea of vote or not is probably going to look silly as fuck looking back. I feel more certain about that than in the idea of a politician I vote for doing stuff I'm happy about.   I'd rather robots take over the world and chop me up into biomatter to fuel their engines than keep going the way we are right now.
The struggles of the old left are also the struggles of the new left.

What did i do on the day after the election? I took a trip in an ambulance out of school because i had a panic attack that was so had people thought i was having a seizure
I‚Äôm not sure how I found this channel, but I sure am happy I did
come si dice "we've elected a bloody fascist and now we're fucked" in italiano?
Simple, we find the gold-plated elevator, break its Otis safety catch, THEN snip the cables
Why does no one ever mention the fact that Hillary didn't even bloody step foot in the rust belt during the election; like no duh of course shed lose of she's not even going to appeal to the swing states that count in the most in the electoral college. Sure no one could've predicted beforehand that anyone would be dumb enough to do that, but she did and was the main reason she lost (+ trump had populist rhetoric; she didn't)
back watching this video after trump publicly declared himself a nationalist -_-
It was 4chan. It‚Äôs always 4chan
By last official count, tRump lost the popular vote by 3.1 million... notice how I didn‚Äôt say Hilary won.   It‚Äôs the shit sandwich (tRump) vs giant Douche (Clinton) conundrum from South Park, the douche is undesirable but at least is good for something. A shit sandwich is a sight to be hold for the broken (read: a bit sick in the head) to see but ultimately has no use, revolts most people on sight, no one wants it
Bernie "you don't know what it's like to poor if you're white" Sanders.
I‚Äôm part of the authoritarian old left, as a Marxist-Leninist. However, I do sympathise with certain new left, more socially progressive individuals.
I don't know what your male name was, but it HAD to be Scott. Every dude named Scott that I have ever known looks like you in male mode lol.
Saying it wasn't a failure of the polls, while closer to accurate than the vast majority of people talking about this, is not quite right either. Nate Silver said it was a normal failure of the polls. The polls were off, but they were off within the normal range. The reason models like the New York Times were so wrong, also according to Silver, was because they treated each state as though they were independent so a lot of polls would have to be wrong for Trump to win. The FiveThirtyEight model accounted for the fact that certain groups, like poor whites in the rust belt being underaccounted for, could swing several polls at the same time and so a normal error has a bigger effect in their model than it did in the Times model.
This was probably already mentioned, but Bernie didn‚Äôt just fail to win, he was actively destroyed by the Clinton campaign and its allies.  People choose between socialism or ethnic cleansing? Most of my circles on the right, we are more concerned with stifling government, media, deep state, corporatocracy.....   This whole hail satan thing... if you you think it‚Äôs only a joke I urge you to be be careful with that kind of thing.
I dunno guys I still feel the Bern üò¢
Hail Satan
Wiemer republic sounds like the US rn.
4:25 the odds of flipping two coins and getting two heads is 1/8. Also I love your videos, please keep making sounds with your mouth.
13:21 "Hilary's relatively few misdeeds..." ?!?! You are joking, aren't you?
I think my cat likes your voice. She keeps rubbing her face on my phone and she ran away during an ad but came back when your voice came back on lmao
This was spot on. The outrage of both sides has escalated and now we have full on class warfare with a one party system for a while. I want to share this with my Republican friends on Facebook, but I live in the deep South of FL and saying anything against the orange messiah is sacrilegious. It's really bad.
Best trump Impression
there have been several nods to italian culture/language in your videos. Were you also an Italian student? Love the Dante references
White people blame us why not everyone does
I disagree with the Bernie point. He was never able to appeal to older black voters, he appealed to younger black voters though. At least where I'm from.
Another source of Ryan Murphy's intense genius unearthed - you *so* made Kathy Bates say "Hail Satan."
He won cause he is famous
LISTEN I HATE THE LEFT AND I HATE THE RIGHT  BUT AT THIS POINT THE ONLY WHO CAN DEFEAT DONALD IS THE ROCK
Two years on, this is actually the most calming thing I've seen all week.  Thank you for this.
Watching this is hindsight, you were too optimistic. I hoped for impeachment, but that probably won't happen unless Trump messes up extremely terribly. I genuinely almost cried the morning I discovered Trump won the election, and prepared for World War III.
There are a million reasons why Donald Trump won and one reason why Bernie lost?
You forgot about those who voted for him because they see the world in rose colored glasses and take his declarations of "Fake News" to be gospel. And those who voted for him to avoid voting against family members.
I see you there with that Brahms 4th
You're homophobic how dare you call them sexual deviants
Brasil is down the same hill and i want to kill myself too yeey
That was definitely me at 2 am election night.
F*ck now I gotta read Paradise lost. That's going to be such a pain.
'Hillary's relatively few misdeeds'? Only someone safe behind the USA's nuclear arsenal would describe supporting the war in Iraq, invading Libya, implementing a coup in Honduras, planning the coup in the Ukraine and starting the war in Syria as 'misdeeds'. Check your American privilege!
2:58 "The most optimistic view is that he won't do any of the things he said he'dd do." - So arguably, your most optimistic view turned out to be kinda right. He certainly pushed conservative agenda. But nothing extraordinary. It seems that only the things he SAYS are truly awful. (I'm not American, so please correct me if I'm wrong)  And I think that the left really pushed a lot of people away because of bad manners. Listen, when someone is racist, you may point it out. But unless you do so carefully and respectfully you'll push him away. Also, addressing all white men like children throwing a tantrum is exactly the kind of language that pushed them away. You're shooting yourself in the foot here. (Imagine the disdain you feel when a youtuber addressees "All SJW snowflakes who are going to be triggered")
I've been binge watching your videos for the first time, and I am convinced you are part of RedLetterMedia.
I'm from Brazil, and we're currently in the same situation. One of the main candidates for president here is, no joking, just as bad as Trump - When i googled his name + "politics" it suggested "polemics" instead. And there are people that, because they worship him, are denying the Dictatorship that happened here in the 60s (for us Brazillians, it's almost as bad as holocaust deniers) and saying that "only criminals got executed". The rest of the main candidates aren't particularly good, but still nowhere nearly as bad.
Where the fuck you were when I was getting suckered in by right wing yobos Curse my misguided, uneducated youth spent bitterly cursing people who weren't at fault for my woes.
People are going to regret voting for trump when this next tax season comes through.
It is easier to lie to someone than to convince someone they've been lied too.
And is turn out to be fine
Hail Satan
Trump won for two major reasons: 1) No one wanted to die in a nuclear war, so Hillary and Obama antagonizing Putin over a proxy war in Syria was unappealing to everyone who loves being alive. 2) I gave him all my energy, and I stockpiled a lot.
Oh god why Am I pouring my headspace full of american politics when I live in the netherlands?!!
The old left > New Left
7:33 *looks at sign* oh boy
0:45 JaclynGlenn :D
fascism (as defined by contrapoints)- pursuing a racial scapegoat.   and here we are creating a racial divide and giving this movement the wind in its sails...   you would think if you were truly anti fascist, you wouldn't promote racist rhetoric. ie. black people this or white people that.   could it be that really you're hand in hand promoting the same thing you despise about Donald trump?   think long and hard about what you are doing. the game is chess, not checkers.
#downwithtrumphailsatan
Hbomber, Lindsay, and Contra are the holy trinity of YT in my brain.
great analysis
maybe in 2020, the dems will put up someone who isn't a cutout of corporatist America.  Then they might have a chance.
hey, contra, how it is nearly 2  years on? economy growth 4+ percent, no new wars, is he still a Hitler?
Ay Baltimore pride with all that Natty. I feel like you'd be a cool person to drink with. Nice video too!
His daughter and her husband are Jewish, and he is the most pro-Israel president the USA has ever had. Tell me again how he is anti-Semitic?
I love you <3
I (assume I) lost a job because I voted for Jill Stein. My boss said i had voted for trump by not voting for Hillary, which I found alarming for a well educated and self made woman to say... because I had obviously voted for Jill Stein, as I told her.  But alas, not everyone has the sensibilities I do. And so the country is doomed. To be fair Jill would have most likely fallen in line with the bourgeoisie party line once they told her about aliens and the deep web. But a man can dream sometimes...   I'd rather tell the establishment "this is my vote" than be socially coerced into doing something disingenuous, and counter productive to what I see as the best course of action into the future. I mean the only real alternative is antifa and we all see where that goes. And fast.
In your quote of Milton, following the comparison, your protestations would only create more support for Trump.
Night Owl II: What happened to the American Dream? The Comedian: It came true. You're lookin' at it.
Well Trumps cronies are being tried and convicted or pleading guilty now. We know that Trump stole the election with help from Putin and gerrymandering congressional districts to split the democratic vote. Now we are waiting for Mueller to take the large cheeto down. There will be dancing in the streets.
Don't hail Satan, just let him do his thing, then hail yourself in the freedom from God his way creates.
a crossdresser crossdressing is just dressing?
I was so happy when Obama became president, I believed America finally stopped being that country that murdered Lincoln, Crazy Horse & King. But became the country of 'I have a dream ' ... The leader of the free world is now this buffoon.. What T F happened???
You displayed Dave Chappelle when talking about people who have biases under the headline about him "bashing LGBT communities" but he's since corrected his comments and I think that's worth noting.
Still waiting...
Came to watch this as his empire started crashing down in the past hour with Manafort and Cohen. <3
fear not comrade the socialist revolt shall rise in the name of lenin marx and humanity
"Woah. Down with Trump. Hail Satan." Pls make that a bumper sticker so I can fight obnoxious with obnoxious in my school's "Trump won, get over it" bumper sticker-flooded parking lot
Contrapoints is the Red Letter Media of politics.
Hail Satan!
Your video gives me hope. Ty!
What you didn't realise at the time is how he would just lie about his failures and spin them as either success or the dems' fault.
16:30 "dispare" ;p another amazing vid tho!
Are you trying to talk in spanish with those part numbers?! :)
The slightly better off part of the working class white males have more time to be concerned about social and political abstractions though. That explains, at least in part, why they were the ones votig for trump.
fucking nonono
I‚Äôve spent many hours binging your videos from start to now. And I‚Äôm pissed at the way you pronounce Appalachian. Everything else? Top notch, bro.
4th comment - why I am so emotional XD
part 5 he is your president, deal with it
is almost as if Trump was narrated into the office
ncie you know democrats is comies and po-mo XD
I laughed when hillary lost
But if Trump resigns we have Pence and he‚Äôs evil too
We. Are. Seriously fucked.
I realize this is old but as a hippie marxist the infographic felt me confused. I identify as a hippie because it was the first place I felt home in the world.  But my experience has been mostly built on the values of socialism (barter/trade/trust, sharing everything, co-op style business's) that led me to become a socialist.
Bringer of Light has my vote.
Daddy Bernie :'(
It's 2018, and his supporters are doubling down on their support of Trump.  At this point I don't think him getting us into a war on American soil would derail their adoration, but we've had worse presidents,  we'll survive.
Oh, here‚Äôs the fucking nuance... took me forever to find it.  I guess it was hiding here on your channel the whole time.
Trump was a populist attempt to troll those people who refused to engage in honest debate. That's what happened. The far left ideologues adopted policies of intimidation over reason and thus killed the tools of debate. The conversation and consideration of ideas died and some people felt powerless as the law began to side with antienlightenment values. So they elected the troll king to show them that they are a small minority and the dangers of democracies against minorities. It was an attempt by the right to show the far left the consequences of using democratic power unjustly and that their unexamined complacency in their ideologies would be their undoing. No one actually liked Trump, they just ALL hated Hillary, the DNC, Bernie using campaign funds to get his sixth mansion lake home, and the useless GOP who claims they want to shrink government and give the power to the people but grow it every year in ways that Rs disagree with.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but HAIL SATAN!!!
What are your opinions regarding the DNC undermining Sanders chances and basically selecting Hillary regardless of what their voters wanted?
Not your best, can't believe you brushed off the whole immigration thing as simple bigotry and misuderstanding or whatever. His stance on immigration and border policy were the core reason why he won, everything that could possible be also taken into account (such as a rejection for the Clinton family, and the political correctness, as if that were a real reason...) comes quite far behind it. I'd love if you could make an updated version of this, analysing the way his support evolved with time (and it could include the whole Kanye West thing).
Why not riot how do you provoke change if not by radical bits by bits
Is that Emperor Palpatine reading Milton?
I was young in the UK of the 80's when the establishment started to redefine the left from stuff like trade unionism, state ownership, and income distribution, to stuff like the rights of (unpopular) minorities, feminism, and environmentalism. I could see it happening.  It was a scam. But one that paid off. The unions were destroyed and the political consciousness of the working class shrank to a confused and resentful gay-bashing dot. Hitler's dream of destroying socialism was actually achieved by Thatcher here in Britain all those years ago.  A similar plot was afoot in the US it seems.  It sickens me to see the new Left:  fascist bourgeois stooges and diversionists, posing as progressives, using minorities as political footballs, and failing to even acknowledge basic political realities.  The truth is that 'The Left' no longer exists. The sniggering jokers,the posturing privileged youth, the loons, and PC daleks who now go by that name bear little resemblance to a once relevant and vital movement dealing with the real issues:  the mass control, exploitation, and oppression of the majority of people, not just minorities .  It is the End of Fucking History alright.
This is really hard to watch in July 2018
Don't forget the part where black people lost their jobs the suburbs which they were carefully kept out of through federal redlining policies and local neighborhood covenants (plus a heaping of personal harassment and terrorism).  Also don't forget about all the jobs that the rust belt is losing to the union-averse south (see what I did there?)
DOWN WITH TRUMP HAIL SATAN DOWN WITH TRUMP HAIL SATAN DOWN WITH TRUMP HAIL SATAN
Ahh, remember back when we thought Trump was a "borderline" white nationalist? Those were the days.
Isn't that propaganda from the Onion?
hail satan.
Here we are, more than a year later and people are still sucking his dick, I‚Äôm genuinely worried for this country
When did trump ever blame blacks  or Jews?
Bernie never appealed to Hispanic voters, yes he did we just can't vote, we're poor and the majority don't have ID's but there's lots of support fam
So, it's been a while, any updates?
Who's the narrator at 16:28?
That was EXACTLY me on Election Day, same time frames, same initial smugness, slightly less alcohol but still a lot...
He's done almost everything he said he'll do and more :') 2 years to go haters
I knew trump was going to win as soon as Hillary was the candidate for the democrats.  Her persona is surrounded by scandal like her dubious charity and I‚Äôm not sure why she hasn‚Äôt divorced bill because his legacy is a stone around her neck. Anyone remember when bills rape victims were invited to sit front and center near Hillary during a debate? Trump is a sleaze ball but for all we know he‚Äôs had consensual sex even if he has cheated.
Watched this almost two years later. The video holds up well I think.
Going back and rewatching all of your videos now that I am more interested I'm politics that I ever have been.  Thanks for you amazing content ! <3
When you mentioned the articles why must it be a single reason?  Why cant it be well all of em
Silly as it is I‚Äôd like to know your astrological sign. I‚Äôm a Leo with a Capricorn rising and Sagittarius moon.... but I totally don‚Äôt believe in it.... (or do I?)
your prediction that now trump fans would start blaming trump for things because he's in power was a bit overly optimistic in hindsight.
Your Hunter S Thompson impression, holy shit, is that premium.
15:28 hahahahaha we WISH people would start blaming Trump for his own behavior
November 8, 2016 was a weird day for me. I just finished my 15hr day as a poll clerk. I walked home around 10-11pm and looked layed in bed. I looked at my phone and saw the results that Trump won: ‚ÄúOh....uh ok...um wow‚Äù, then i went to sleep
Sorry, love your stuff but had to down vote this one.  Too many factual errors.  Nicely presented though.  Kinda an homage to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1ULjJ3EqyY
I loved how you used a picture of Argentina's plaza Rodriguez Pe√±a, circa 2008, where all the emo kids went to hang out. I know this because I was one of them.
Just wait and see the 2020 election do another Bush-styled 'Hail, Mary!' with ANOTHER 4 years of Trump.
'Hilary's competitively few misdeeds...' spoken by someone who clearly has no idea what the Clintons have done.
you know i‚Äôve watched a lot of your videos but shit i gotta admit it i‚Äôm *still* a fascist
I was actually, surprisingly, not sure about any victory in 2016  I don‚Äôt think it helped....
Just checking in. The Donald is talking to Kim Jong Un today. Hopefully I'll be able to update again tomorrow. If not, we all died in a firey inferno.
The new left is bullshit, it's not the true left, they are right wing infiltrators, they deserve the Gulags Stalin sure as hell would send them there and he would be right to do that  Bernie Sanders was fucked over by the liberals, the DNC favored and rigged the primaries against him, because they are liberals and liberals are capitalist, so they aren't leftists and they are the enemies of the left  Also, if minorities preferred Clinton, then they deserve the poverty in which they are in, since they supported a repubblican They deserve the suffering the repubblicans are going to inflict them, not mercy for them
The welfare queens comic from 9:56 is from the onion LMAO
You're wrong about Bernie and Hilary. Bernie lost because of a rigged primary despite having greater support across all sections of society. Hilary wasn't even popular with the democratic base.
I'm all for telling other people not to kill themselves but my planet is being set on fire. We're on track to decimate the invertebrate population last I heard, we're tearing down everything else that grows and replacing it with poaceae, we're dumping our waste in a nigh oxygen-devoid hole in the ground, bitching about tobacco smoke while everybody revs their engine impatiently at red lights until I suffocate, driving thirty feet to a friends house, driving past farmers markets to go buy cheese doodles....... Can I please just be allowed to kill myself? Can US law just make this one exception just for me? Please..?
Lol small town Americans live in a bubble? What do you call the west coast where the biggest problem is someone misgendered you?
daaamn
marmite sucks. vegemite for life
-Complaints about Trump being racist. - Calls fachism stupid because it blames everything on a racial scape goat  -Blames whites throughout the entire Video and supports a system that devides by race.   Congratulations! You played yourself.
Well, we're a good ways into the Trump administration and the world has not collapsed.  No concentration camps have been erected, no pogroms initiated, no major wars started.  Things pretty much stumble along as they have previously.  The Syrian civil war is hopefully in its end-game, and Putin has announced that the next stage of Russian focus will be on internal economic development.  The American economy, although not exactly great, putters along.  The trains are still running, and the wealthy continue to ignore the needs of the masses.  I didn't vote for Trump last election, but if things keep going like they have been, I have to admit I'm tempted to see what happens with another four years.
The intro to this video sums up that god awful night so well.
Super random comment: the image at 11:59 is at a park in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Funny.
Hail Satan!
I was with you up until the hail Satan part.
Pretty good analysis but I feel you should have mentioned that Bernie lost the nomination in large part because the entire establishment media and the DNC was against him from the start. If he had gotten more exposure, I'm pretty confident his message would have resonated with black and latino voters.  You also seem to assume that the Democrats have a spine. With the power of hindsight, we now know that they refuse to obstruct the Republicans whenever push comes to shove (they rolled over on DACA, the Dreamers, voted to give Trump the power to spy on people without a warrant and increased his military budget). This is of course because the people that buy politicians make sure to buy weak democrats that bend over and expose their anuses every time the Republicans feel like fucking them.
&...this vid is just as relevant as it was when it went up...fuuuuuuuuuuck...
Voice in your old videos is so much better!
Haha I can‚Äôt believe I missed this.
Much as I can't stand either party I can't wait for the Blue Wave at the midterms.
One year later and Trump ends the Korean War. He really is the worst president
In the US, as a colonial settler state, race and class are almost synonymous. Check out the book Settlers by J. Sakai. It does a really great job of showing why the white working class is so reactionary, and why I don't try too hard to reach out to them.
holy heck.  It's just good content.  just gooood content
1:00
I think that the past year and a half have shown that hoping that the Democrats would try to obstruct the Trump agenda was wishful thinking.  Tim Kaine now wants to give Trump unlimited war powers.
Trump  won because +2 million illegal votes aren't enough if you place them all in Commiefornia.
\m/   HAIL SATAN   \m/
Almost two years later this is one of the most universal ways to analyze the political turmoil affecting most western democracies. Beautifully said, thank you, and Hail Satan!
all the graphs show the elite (such as himself?) getting richer yet he ignores this.
the left are elitist who divide the population to conquoore, men v women staright v gay black v white whilst the elite get ever righer.
Nice touch using the Brahms theme after hailing Satan, as that tune is commonly used during services in American (Protestant) churches.
Oh yeah. That was the election I watched Right-Side Broadcasting (basically 2 guys) reporting on all the Trump rallies, getting there hours in advance, talking to people, taking the temperature, and contrasting that with what was in the MSM. Since the MSM clearly didn't have a clue was was actually going on outside their retarded media bubble, I put money on Trump to win, because the bookies watch the MSM and not the alt-media. Easy money and I didn't even vote for the guy.
females are inferior to male.Thats the truth.Trying to replace male with female its like replacing fire with water.
lol National Bohemians. DC/Bmore region call out!!
If you guys wuldn't sit on the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world, me and my european fellows would have the fun of our live about your president.  Edit: You let it look like a socialist regime wouldn't have racial tendencies. I think that this wasn't your intention, but a lot of people ignore that in the soviet union, expetionaly under Stalin, race sepretation was a big thing.  Oh shit. I hope I don't relativate the drittes Reich with this shit.
1.Trump won because idiots like me voted for him. 2.Hillary would have been just as bad. 3.Fascism is capitalism. 4.Bernie lost because the establishment democrats rigged the election. 5.Communism is the ONLY solution.
Down with trump hail Satan! Hilarious!
aww, so innocent before twitter broke her
Suh-jews
80% of welfare goes to women and the overwhelming majority of social programmes and research health spending goes to women. Men with their shorter lifespans and higher average incomes fund this. There are virtually no social programmes at aimed at men and it is why the majority of the homeless are men
Satan for president 2020!!!
Honest question: Do you think that it is possible for fascism system to be non racist? Kind of civic nationalism system instead of racially motivated?
That awkward moment when black quality of life across the nation is going up directly due to some of Trump‚Äôs policies
I was seriously thinking about killing myself, thank you , you just saved a life.
Satan/Cthulhu 2020!!!
Commenting again for 1k. But who thought taking a shit in the street was the best way to fight trump AHAHAHAHAHAHA
1:00 died ahahahha ‚ÄúShitting‚Äù
Trumps a playboy tbh
White women vote for Trump to don't just put that shit on white men
That's the second video of yours that I have seen. When you referenced Rashomon it brought a smile to my face. But when the credits rolled to Brahms' 1st symphony I was ecstatic. Sending lots of anonymous viewer platonic internet love your way.
Late to the party. I finally get where all the "Hail Satan" on your later vids is from lol Actually, I've been trying to keep my exposure to Trump to a minimum bc my guts attacked me when he stole the election (I know that's a strange thing for a human body to do under stress, but I'm not a crier. That's what happens when my stress levels explode.) I'm missing out on some of your vids bc Trump literally makes me sick  :(  I spent my formative years in Northern Redneckland, on the Canadian side of Detroit, so yeah. Major trauma when that douche duped the Kid Rock loving, beer swilling lynch mobs of my youth into voting for him. I'm revisiting some of the coverage now that my guts don't feel like they're on fire every time I look at the fash mob. Well... I feel a little safer knowing that the guy who took down Gotti is working dilligently to impeach him   :)  Nice vid. This was one of your better ones, imo. This and the first Baltimore vid. Keep up the good work  :)
Comment #1000
new 'left' = neoliberalism.................................
The sad truth is that most people who voted for Trump are older people. God I can't wait for the fucking baby boomers to leave the face of the earth.
Hilary is terrible enough that more people liked Trump.
1:00 "Shitting"... whoo!, that's my home country
Actually, if Facebook is anything to go by, it seems people are still blaming Obama and Hillary for everything wrong that happens. And before anyone calls me a Hillary supporter: Well... To be frank, my opinion about her is that she could only possibly be considered a good candidate, in comparison to Trump.
This was absolutely fantastic. Well done.
Mostly accurate, although Bernie didn‚Äôt win the Democratic nomination because the Democrats rigged the system against him.
Communism should not be tolerated whatsoever. It cannot allocate resources efficiently enough to sustain a society, the only reason the USSR 'worked' (which it really didn't many products were made, but the quality was garbage, especially the war equipment, the Japanese were able to destroy tanks with Molotov cocktails due to the lack of incentivization to quality.) is because it had a large amount of land and resources, and many ended up going to unwanted products, as planned economies cannot adapt to wanted features nearly as fast as market economies can.
9:49 Edward Bernays. Create a sense of identity from owning products. Notice all the product placement? There is a Con played on all of us to have us spend on things we don't need. The net result of this poor planning and impulse purchasing has left most of America without tangible wealth. People need to save to invest, have ethics to save, but those who realized this also realize America isn't great for work talent. Luckily for them (and me), we live in a global economy they can navigate.
Hehe. Love the random "flying circus" reference. "An old historian". Lol
alright, so all this is pretty bad but please, dear god, let canada be ok... i like canada :(
I've been watching Destiny lately, and just happened to watch this again. Something he said that was interesting was that the polls apparently weren't wrong at all, only the predictions people made were wrong. Most polling data showed them as very close, yeah.
"a pretty robust welfare state" Oh God my sides
A nuclear WWIII is our hope for destroying Capitalism. We must build a giant communications tower and reach out into the stars, we may return to the sea someday, after we make Contact. Look up my name and read every sacred text.
Part 5: Assassiate him!!!
Are you Mr Plinkett's love child?
Girls, sexual deviants, and hippies? SIGN ME UP!
This video did not age well...
Also, speaking as a Brit, it might be prudent to say farewell to the whole two party system (though I'm speaking as an ancom here so what do I know about voting?). American politics still seems to be at the Whigs and Tories stage with a left that is completely alienated from mainstream politics. Also,  for anyone who conflates liberals with the left or the Democratic party with leftist ideas, lemme break it down for you: republicans = right wing, democrats = centrists, liberals are their own thing and have very little to do with real leftists (though we do agree on some points) and no, I wouldn't vote for Hillary because I'm not a dumbass party loyalist with no understanding of nuance or ideology.   No pasaran.
Are they really that difficult to merge though? I always saw a lot of the issues regarding race, sexuality and gender as a direct result of class politics (by which I don't just mean socio-economic relationships between the haves and have-nots, but also the evolution of those relationships and the influences of certain in-groups like religious organisations). Capitalism is an improvement on feudalism in the sense that most stuff is accomplished through more subtle means of coercion rather than absolute authority and the same goes for social issues. They all relate back to the push against those on the lower rung of a society that's been defined almost entirely by a mixture of fluid and non-fluid hierarchies.
This is interesting to watch 1 year later.
Huh. And here I'd been thinking Trump WAS Satan.
I've always been disturbed by the negativity surrounding so called sexual "deviancy". I'm a straight dude but I just don't see how transgenders or homosexuality in general harms society at all. Why are so many people so preoccupied with what somebody they don't even know is doing with their dick or pussy lol? If we were talking about pedophilia, bestiality or sexual assault then yes obviously that's wrong and fucked up. But I would classify those people as sexual predators and *CRIMINALS* not "deviants". Neither of which has anything to do with each other. In the case of people that want to fuck other consenting adults.. why is it even an issue? Coming out should'nt even be a thing imo. Who cares if someone is gay LMAO. I swear sometimes I feel like I was born in the wrong era because people are still so fucking stupid it's beyond ridiculous
We just need to bring back the Marxists and Anarchists. They actually have a platform for economic freedom.
In retrospect ... "people will blame HIM" Well... they're not...they're still blaming everyone EXCEPT him... 1/4 the in...
I was kinda dissociating towards the end of this (it happens sometimes) and when the bit about hell came up I genuinely thought it was emperor palpatine talking directly to me and i freaked tf out
this is like the fifth video I'm watching of your channel and you make pretty neat videos and debates with yourself. about time someone figured out a better way to invite people to think about things.
I have had some success explaining to new Left people how the social and economic systems opposed by the old lefties is a tool of the powerful elite white class pitting pretty much every group against each other.
A year on, it just keeps getting worse.
i have to say that all this degrading behaviour towards you is pathetic. I enjoy your personality and your attemps to confront these topics in a quite rational way (while drunk) Much love from pickle Rick <3 wuuuuubaduuuubaduuuubduuuuuuuub
"Down with Trump, Hail Satan" lol. Great ending!
I realize this is awfully damned late, but if you are worried about international affairs, it isn't Trump that should frighten you, it was  Hillary who should have had you waking up everything night screaming in terror.  Trump is a businessman who wants to make deals.  How well he would do in the international arena using a business-like approach, we'll find out.  On the other hand, Hillary, setting aside things from 20 or 30 years ago, and just looking at her most recent job as Secretary of State, a job which is nothing but foreign affairs, what did she do?  She installed literal nazis into the government of Ukraine - whatever you feel about Putin or Russia, you can surely appreciate this is an incredible provocation to them given what the nazis did to their country back in the 1940s.  What else did she do?  She saw to the overthrow of Mubarak and Qaddafi, secular leaders who actively suppressed Islamic terrorism in their countries, and whose death allowed those Islamic terrorists to swiftly pour out chaos around the whole region.  Egypt did regain control from the Muslim Brotherhood, but Libya is still a disaster, to the point that an actual real slave trade is going on there now.  She wanted to overthrow Assad, another secular dictator suppressing Islamic terrorists.  Also an important ally of Russia - another poke-in-the-eye to Putin.  To the end of overthrowing Assad, she allied with innumerable, unknowable local groups, many of which ended up being associated with al-Qaeda or ISIS, spreading more Islamic terrorism in the region.  When given the opportunity to overthrow the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world (Islamic terrorism at that), Iran, not only did she fail to support the revolution in Iran, she failed to support TWO SEPARATE revolutions there.  Thus allowing a known Islamic terrorist theocracy to thrive.  After enough examples of tearing down secular states and supporting Islamic terrorists, you have to accept that that was not bad luck, an unfortunate coincidence, or poor planning, but was the actual policy objective.  Why she wanted to spread Islamic terrorism is not a question I can answer, and not one she is likely to ever answer for us, but there are too many examples of that outcome being the result of her policies for it to be anything but her desired end goal.  And if you still insist on chalking it up to incompetence rather than malice, that still doesn't help the case that should would have been better in the foreign affairs arena.  So Trump, who will want to negotiate deals with foreign leaders, regardless of whether or not you think he will be successful at it, or Hillary, who literally supports real nazis against Russia, and seeks to spread Islamic terrorism.  Who was going to be the real foreign policy disaster as president?  I know there are many on the left who want to paint Trump and his supporters as nazis, but unfortunately the left has a pretty bad tendency to project, like in this case, as the fact is that their candidate was the one who actually supported nazis.
We should've killed him when we had the chance.
HAIL SATAN!!!
A year later and Trump is still a fucking piece of shit.
sorry but your "parghte unooooo" was so hillarious tha i couldn¬¥t do nothing but laugh until my diaphragm got tired
I respect you less due to you showing the splc for stats
Trump voters: Trump isn't afraid to speak his mind. He's not restrained by stupid notions of "political correctness."  Also Trump voters: Oh god, he's tweeting again.
Basically all the people that are going to be in charge tomorrow got pissed off and shit on yesterday‚úåüçÄüåàüíñüåûüëä
Love your stuff normally but the imperialist shit here was very...Off.
2020 cannot get here soon enough...One year down....three to go ...My god....
Now that the year is gone by the world has a better perspective on the events leading up to the 2016 election. I found this video essay very insightful. I'm Amazed you were able to put it together so quickly when most people couldn't even gather their thoughts
I am so fucking glad I found this channel. This video was made right after the election, and yet it has the best analysis, almost one year later, that I have found. After much research on my own, I have come to many of the same conclusions. Without the Milton, that is, because I just don't get down with fancy literature. But Satan sounds cool.  ContraPoints, you are the shit. I adore you. I love your brain.
Don't agree. But great video. Who's the real racist and what's wrong with it? Fuuuuck hail Satan indeed. Keep going though. Finally the left may have some balls and some intellect and some sense of humour.
Hail Satan, and megustalations!
I've been reevaluating my approach to the topic of free speech, as you make compelling arguments that resonate with what I've observed, but I feel it's vitally important that I correct you on a point you made in this video about Senator Bernie Sanders: He did not lose the nomination due to a lack of appeal among black and Hispanic people, women, or the lgbt community. He actually has majority approval among all key demographics and his loss was largely due to the Clinton campaign rigging the primary for the purpose of assuring Hillary would be the Democratic candidate. The email leaks and the corroboration of Donna Brazile and Senator Elizabeth Warren confirm that this is not simply a Bernie Bro conspiracy, Clinton stole the nomination.
This is great. I'd love to see you do a year in review in January of his first year in office.
You got it right!   No Bernie? You got Trump.
Had my like right up until the ad ice at the end. No riots? Never rule out a tactic with that much potential. No suicide? That's personal, judging people in their darkest moments is not on.
Donald J. Trump is your president for the next eight years and your tears are delicious.
Also, the left, both old and new, IS the meme, which is why the left can't meme.  I hope, and I am gratified at seeing, the left eat itself like a snake eating its own tail.  Videos like this really help along that chopping-oneself-at-the-knees.
Calling Trump a proto-fascist while ignoring similar authoritarianism in Obama:  loss of video credibility.
Excellent video! So thorough, yet so cogently expressed. Thank you!  Just wanted to note to you, though, 10:22 this has happened before. I highly recommend "Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs" by Hunter S Thompson (I know you like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas ^_~ ) and then check out this article in The Nation, https://www.thenation.com/article/this-political-theorist-predicted-the-rise-of-trumpism-his-name-was-hunter-s-thompson/ which talks exactly about this kind of white disenfranchisement and the impact that it has.  Stay Awesome! loooooove your videos.
15:40 I think the word you want is "although" :)
This video was very prophetic
I fucking love this timeline

Even though Sanders is not a true socialist,  he eas the best hope for America.
optomistic
I like how you condescendingly imply the electoral college is somehow unique in western democracy making it hard to understand for non-Americans, when it's very common in all western democracies that votes, non of us have direct democracy, we elect parliaments who elect who does shit around here. And no, one vote is not one vote. Norway actually has a formula for how a vote should count per county. It's "(Total km^2*1,8)+population" weird? yeah. Unfair? Yeah. As you can see, this isn't a exclusivly American problem.
This was really outstanding. Months later it is completely resonating. Way to find light in the darkness, CP.
I disagree with you on many political points but I love your video style.
A toast of hearty hearty yaks' blood to you too, ma'am
Forgot to add that the old left was also racist af. Lefties love leaving that out.
Contra points IS my daddy
Very reasonable, loved this so much. I'm ig what you would call an anti-sjw classical liberal and I just love your channel.
This *is* the apocalypse.
Great video, subscribed
The first minute was literally my roommate and I. I don't know where you got that video... We scrapped the streaming to torture misogynists plan, so I'm kinda frightened that you found that. *sigh* Things have actually gone more downhill since this. Amazingly.
>Bernie sanders >socialist I dont think he wants to seize those means.
This is lovely. I love this.
I'm a big fan of quoting Milton to make points. His Satan rocks hard in those first two books.
November 9th was the first time is cried since... I can't even remember
Upvoting for Natty Boh
Bs is not a socialist
You never win an election for one reason. It's like asking which leg a chair stands on.
We must dismantle all forms of oppressive, unjustified hierarchy, whether social or economic. Where do you think the word socio-economic status comes from? The reason that the phrase is often associated with race is because discrimination happens through both social and economic mechanisms.
And its great, lifted the burden on me trying to convince people that Americans are not idiots. Yeah, can't really debate an issue when the other side just says "trump"
Love the Rashomon reference!
bernie lost bc hillary cheated
Down with trump, hail Satan! :D
the comic you used to display racist sentiment against "welfare queens" was an onion comic that was satirizing those sentiments. i'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you already realized that.
Bernie would have won. The DNC tried to shove the wrong candidate down Democratic voters throats and this is what happened as a result.
I'm a little surprised he didn't acknowledge argument that Bernie may have in fact legitimately won the democratic nomination and was somewhat fenageled out of the position through outdated, unsupported, uncredited regulations or at least that the legitimacy of the nomination process is also arguable ü§îü§îü§î
Donald Trump is the savior of the world!
It's time the left came to realise there is an underclass. They're self made failures who hate facts and love Trump/Fox and incest. They have to be exterminated not tolerated or embraced.
Sanders was not a socialist he was a social-democrat
@ContraPoints Great video. Just wanted to agree, the sectarian lines on the left are dumb, and to add that, out of this problem the left probably need ideas that can unite their experiences. So, I'd ask if its worthwhile to talk about ideas that can create a common ground with respect to whets happenings in politics at the moment? Because, the left doesn't really seem to have a good excuse to be divided, rather It seems like it allows itself to be divided. As it is the left is just more complicated than the right, which gets an advantage by just being more uniform. And I guess while the left doesn't have much space in politics yet for its ideas, things are rapidly changing as neolibralism expands, hollows itself out, the mainstream looses its legitimacy.
This was incredibly insightful. Much more put together than the TYT breakdowns.
I agree 100%; Trump really is a filthy baby-eating God-damn Jew, just like Contra said.  I mean, I'll *try* to give him a chance, but if he gets too Jewy...
what about the anarchists though?
6:50 Mexico: "I'm not payin' for that wall either! Fuckin' stupidass american dumbdumbs these days, I swear to god..."
The problem is that the new left HAS to drop the ID politics bullshit and migrate to the old left if you ever want to change anything.  Unity is the most important thing in socialism and ID politics has a tendency to to divide us.
I'm wondering if Contrapoints is the same YouTuber who dissapeared for a while but was around a lot during Zomgits era. Maybe i'm going full tinfoil hat, but I swear I remember a male youtuber who looked the same, and had the same philosophical background.  9/11 was an insect job?
i never... never saw a president fuck so much shit up and be so incompetent and still be in office

Fascism is the last desperate attempt to defend capitalism
You're making a serious mistake if you think that fascism is at odds with capitalism.  Historically, fascist governments have been overwhelmingly friendly to business interests.  Looking at this with the benefit of hindsight, it seems you also underestimated the ability of Trump supporters to maintain their feelings of persecution even while controlling all 3 branches of government.  They witchhunt "the deep state", "the liberal media", and "the obstructionist democratic congress",  and they managed to claim voter fraud even in an election they won.  I mean, for God's sake, these are the people who complain that straight cis white men are a persecuted minority, there's no level of advantage that could quell their victim complex.  Finally, I'd like to contest your narrative about why Bernie lost the primary by such a small margin.  I'd argue that Bernie Sanders only achieved the moderate popularity he did because he never stood a serious chance of winning the democratic nomination.  This may seem counterintuitive, but I'll explain what I mean.  First, he was put into a position where it was inexpedient for any other candidates to attack him.  Both Clinton and Trump knew that he was going to lose, and that they would have to fight over his voters in the general election, so making an enemy of him would be a mistake.  Trump even praised him and criticized his treatment by the DNC and media, in part to win over his voters, and in part because it fed the myth of Clinton/the DNC as being corrupt and crooked.  Second, while Sanders was arguably further to the left than Clinton, as the presumptive nominee, his obscurity meant that he didn't alienate the right.  As the face of the party, Hillary Clinton necessarily came to represent its policies of feminism and racial inclusiveness.  Naturally, people who don't like "political correctness"  had to support someone else.  For some, this meant supporting Trump.  For younger people who don't want to see themselves as their Fox News uncle, this meant supporting Bernie Sanders, because even though he was just as anti-racist as Clinton, he wasn't the face of anti-racism the way Clinton was.  If Bernie Sanders somehow became the nominee, both of these advantages would evaporate.  He would start receiving attacks on his policies and slander on his person the way Clinton had, and he'd go from being a proxy for racists to criticize the most prominent anti-racist candidate to being the most anti-racist candidate, losing him the support of "anti-sjw classical liberals".  Not that I'm saying there were no good, legitimate reasons to support Sanders over Clinton in the primary.  For the record, I'd rather have a president Sanders than a president Clinton.  But after seeing some of the people who supported Sanders in the primary, and after watching the rhetoric of the man who won the white house, of whom it is impossible for anyone to say that he cares about the lower class without bursting into laughter, I refuse to believe that this election is a positive sign for any part of the left, old or new.
1) "Liberals know that without regulations people will revolt against the system, leading to socialism, if the revolution is unified by class or fascism if the revolution is unified by race."  You've just proved that leftists are both socialist and fascists.  2) "Now, Black people have never believed in the American Dream." And I believe this because Malcolm X is representative of the entirety of black thought.  3) When has Trump ever blamed anything on Jews?
Boringly anti trump none sense.
Nice video
"The reason they call it the American Dream is because you have to be asleep to believe it." - George Carlin
As a pensionless, Appalachian opioid addict (no, really) I can confirm that is a myth. I would have died before voting for Trump.
Hail Satan.
3:50 - Thank you for pointing this out. I hated hearing the bullshit about a silent majority. Thanks for pointing out that low turn out was a factor.
AH......Paradise Lost.....<3
I blame the divorced parents of America for most of the worlds problems. HEY COMMENT SECTION ARE YOUR PARENT DIVORCED? HELP CONFIRM MY CONSPIRACY
How did this happen? I don't think it was any one thing. Trump is a very astute demagogue. He's not stupid. He may be vapid and shallow and incompetent, but he's not *stupid*. HRC was a pretty flawed candidate. Comey letter? Meh. Lots of things, really. The working class vote IS a large part of it. The Democrats abandoned them a generation ago, and now the chickens have come home to roost, unfortunately. I think you had a perfect storm of derp in this election and it convinced a whole lot of folks that our country is in the shitter economically and only a buzinezzman can fix it. Regardless of whether or not that's true, I think it won over a whole lot of people. Then there's the change vote. Every election you get a pretty large chunk of people who simply want something different, and Trump represented "different" in this campaign. I'm sure racial bigotry and/or sexism was a motivation for some voters, but I don't think it was a majority or even a very large majority. One thing is very clear: nobody will benefit from this result. At least HRC would've benefited a small minority, but Trump seems insistent on burning down the country in order to "save" it.
Bernie isn't a Socialist, other than that, this is a good video :)

11:56 RAWR XD

Fascism in Spain and Chile was capitalism, and Bernie Sanders isn't a fucking socialist, he is a socialdemocrat.
COMMUNISM WILL PREVAIL
I don't understand how Trump is this giant racist liberals paint him out to be when Mexican and Muslim are *not* races, and when it comes to those two groups are you _really_ in support of *illegal* immigrants who cut in line ahead of others who are actually taking the proper steps to immigrate here legally? If you want to see how well blindly accepting hordes of refugees works out for countries just look at France, where Muslim gangs control no-go zones and the police are all but powerless to stop them, or in Sweden where roughly 90% of shootings are perpetrated by refugees.
In a world where there are only five J. Michael Comforts and six quadrants...
This was a fairly good video. He is correct about Trump voters. But he gets wrong what happened to Democrats, at least on one issue. He makes the standard mainstream claim that Sanders failed to win minority support.   The reality is that Sanders was favored by young minorities and probably poor minorities. Certainly, Clinton lost minority votes like hasn't been seen among Democratic presidential candidates in a long time. She obviously was not the minority-preferred candidate.
FINALLY! An intelligent voice against the alt right youtube echo chamber, love you Contra good for you xxx
WHEN did donald trump 'points the finger at black, jews, ..." When?! You're a realy good commentator, but at 13:00 you turned this video from interesting to BS
it's not exactly true that Sanders didn't appeal to people of color; it's that primary voters of color skew old, and older voters skewed Clinton.   Young people of color certainly rallied behind Sanders
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
well, at least he's doing everything in his power to keep his promises and he is all about science. Was worried about the space program for a while, but we're back on track for a trip to Mars!
This video is completely underappreciated
"There is a *risk* of class conflict"? Class conflict is ever ongoing, sometimes overtly and sometimes covertly, ever since the rise of civilization, and nothing short of the annihilation of private productive property can put an end to it.
Dear ContraPoints, you don't make enough videos... I need more! <3
The Welfare State is the worst invention of man kind. Let's steal people's hard earned money and give it to people who never worked for it.
Sorry Contra I love your channel, but Bernie was cheated on due to corrupt superdelegates. He would have won against Trump. By the way, have you ever heard of what Clinton foundation did in Haiti? And why the hell do you defend her anyway? She laughed at letting go free a child rapist and killing Gaddafi. Why do you think they killed him? For being bad? In Portugal we had a fascist ditactor for 40 years and no one gave a f*** about us. Lybia is a disaster, intervention was all about interests.
I love your voice. üòå
Only one thing: fascism wasn't really about race but culture, at least until Mussolini became Hitler's bitch and started shitting out racial laws and propaganda. I guess what you meant at 9:18 is nazism.
you said hillary's emails three times in your montage bb
Trump is my favorite leader of the  USA.
Do you have sheep in the background while you record this/?? what is that SOUND? it's horrible
In some ways I'm glad he's won cause if he didn't people would still wonder of what could have been and now that he's president their hopes and wishes might just be proven wrong
Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.
The left turned their back on the working class.  Fuck it.  I'm ready for the Thunderdome.
Hail Satan!
Is that silken bathrobe as comfy as it looks?
you are literally the messiah
Dear Contrapoints, can you please tell me who did that Paradise Lost reading and where you found it?
very good video contra!
Netiehslee-eh!
We have a running joke in my family where we suggest that we travel to the US on holiday. My mother absolutely hate America, and now there's absolutely no changing her mind. (I want to visit America at some point. Just not for the next few years or so)
I am disappointed by the Marxist interpretation of the election that you discuss, class and corporate boogeymen instead of addressing the real issue of government and corporate unification against the average person.
marry me, ContraPoints.
16:31 Satan is narrated by Ian McDiarmid, Emperor Palpatine himself.  B)
Nice confluence on "Emails"  Could do with links when you mention specific sources.  Overall pretty good. Looking forward to more.
That has to be Ian McDarmand reading that.
So you say Vladimir Putin is a Tyrann and a dictator? But obeying the Saudi King under Obama was fine or what? Putin isnt a dictator but even if, it would have been nothing new for a US president to support and show admiration for Dictators. And how did Trump showed admiration for Putin? He just doesnt wanted WW3 like Hilary.
"mulsims and imigrants are not going away" little did you know...
Great video! i know this is way late, but i had sneaking suspicion that rich would rather go fascist than socialist.  one of the reasons the media essentially ignored Bernie and the DNC cheated him.  they would rather show a man spouting blatant lies and racial animosity than show someone questioning the rich
Lips on point. Liner on fleek.

your vids have a very RLM vibe (*not a bad thing at all) with the advantage of being in the future, i think trump is so incompetent that he won't be able to get hardly anything accomplished, and is losing (not winning (derp)) on many fronts and of course his thin skin reactionary unique form of idiocy is causing more trouble than anything else...  which brings me to my real worry, that a real crisis will arise, idk say North Korea or ISIS actually gets an attack on US homeland, then his reaction or whatever will escalate to something extreme or be devastating to not only americans but possibly the fucking world, he's so clueless, and the idea that his campaign colluded with the russians really isn't that far fetched anymore, so we truly might end up with a president pence, which is possibly worse, i'm honestly not sure, because i have a strong feeling that the boy scout pence might have kept his nose clean in the campaign shenanigans, or even if he didn't then we're stuck with paul ryan, the epitome of the dumbest closed objectivist randian, so my point is, we're fucked, and i've already got a home spotted in Australia, where i can safely wait till the fall out hits while i try to enjoy beach, either way the possibility of living in a nuclear holocaust wasteland is something to be almost serious about, mad max style boi!~!! go journalism!! (not being ironic i'm fucking serious)
What is your obsession with Anita sarkeesian? :|
Graphs make me feel like shit
The perspective felt a bit pessimistic, but I do think you raised a lot of good points. I voted for Trump because I had some serious reservations against Hillary (particularly her hawkish feelings towards Russia) and, admittedly, because I got caught up in the hype of the anti-SJW Trump-train. I'll never defend the man as a perfect President, but I think he has the potential to be an ok president. Maybe even a good president. We'll just have to wait and see.
Excellent analysis and prescriptions, except for the whole "advocating non-violent protests" and "no riots" part.
"i dare him to build that fucking wall" LOL its already started CUK CUK CUK~~~!!!!!
Took Gv't and Politics at A level only spent the 2nd year on American politics, the Electoral College isn't that hard to understand.
fucking thank you. this is what i've been saying since the pumpkin won. Except for the rioting thing. Riots are important.
Fuck marxism in every form
So personally where are you in politics? Farther left or more liberal left or something else?
Watching you I'm still flabbergasted about how much influence red letter media has had on this sort of format. Even if this commentary has nothing to do with film-criticism.
You know, I like to think that, like, 150 years from now, people will look back on our era of history and wonder what the hell was wrong with people, the same way we look back on things like apartheid and slavery, and videos like these will establish that, no, some of us were not okay with what is going on today. X3
In particular, I really like the device where you structure your video with titled parts that are also the punchline of the previous parts. You are probably not the only person who does that but you do it really well and I want to do that too.
I love your videos so much. You make me want to make better videos because you raise the bar so nice and high.
I'm not American and i dont support Trump. That said, i do watch with disdain of the (extremely obvious) campaign against him. I'm not saying "omg fake news" or anything. Just saying that i feel that the volume of the backlash against him becoming president is extremely artificially magnified by your local media and the Democrats who seem to have it as a strategy to protest and bitch about his every move (even before he made any move) because they feel that it's likely that he'll go away very soon if they pressure him enough, and they're likely to come back to power if that happens.  Also, some of the rumours that are cyrcling the internet seem just liberal fantasy conspiracy theories of morons who dont understand how the world around them works. The most prominent one of those just cant seem to grasp the concept that the Republicans may have a slightly different foreign policy than the democrats. So, they cant come to terms with him saying that he wants to mend fences with the Russians, which can only be a good thing in the minds of anyone who's not a complete moron. They seem to really have the need to make conspiracy theories in order to bridge their idiotic belief that U.S. foreign policy is about human rights and democracy and against Dictators like Puttin.  Otherwise yes, Trump seems to be very bad. Is he worse than Obama? Personally i feel that i need to see actions (not just words) before i judge that to be true. Obama surely was portrayed as some kind of an intellectual saint, but he did bloody a BIG part of our world, brought us closer to nuclear war with his warmongering expansion of Nato right to the borders of Russia, spied on the whole world etc etc. Trump has to do very bad things to top all of that.
Ha, to that point about Trump voters knowing what he stood for, I disagree. A friend's mother was very excited to vote for Trump, and so was my friend. His mother's boyfriend is an illegal immigrant. I swear I'm not making this up, I don't know how they managed to not know about Trump's views on immigrants. I know my friend never keeps up with the news, and apparently his mother doesn't either. They only ever retracted their support for Trump once they heard about the "grab them by the pussy" stuff and she's also very pro-choice, so that was the end of that.
15:21 Anything that can't be deflected onto the previous president will be rationalized by saying that the other candidate would've been worse. Trump will be the eternal victim of Obama and the Clintons.
It's funny how you can identify Trump and his rhetoric as scapegoating but can't do the same with communists. No, the evil capitalists aren't taking your money away. Replacing capitalism with communism or insane redistributive policies will not make you rich, it will make you poorer in the long run. There is no simple trick to this, no easy scapegoat to kill, which will fix all the problems in the country.
@ContraPoints nice that you analyze th events but actually i think the problem is a little more systematic, a two party system with winner takes all elections leads to a situation in which the voter has no choice whatsoever, he can choose the piano player at the whorehouse but the the establishmenat is able to permanently keep control and access to political power. (english as a second language)
You know who else said the Poles are wrong?  Hitler
Awake! Arise! Or be forever fallen! Man I love Satan.
XD 13 days after he gets elected he's doing everything he said
None of this was accurate, more wishful thinking.... Trump won for economic reason... Had nothing to do with racism... Trump campaigned heavily in The Rust Belt, those states gave him the victory. The same states that gave Obama two victories. As of right now, Trump has kept all of his promises.    I guess the sensisble thing for you all to do is kill yourselves. You are nothing more than leeches that want a massive welfare state. Well, if you wouldn't have been so dependent on Government interventionism, then you would not care about the president, as he would not really affect you. And he isn't for the most part.    Remmeber leftism is a mental disorder, so kill yourselves. ;)))
Thanks for the re-election
Was it rashomon ?
Fucking brilliant analysis. That's all I gotta say.
As a political science major at a top tier world-renowned public university, I gotta say this is the best political-economic-social analysis of the Trump election i've seen to date. You might be a former philosophy professor, but you could easily go toe to toe with many political science professors at my university.
Why does so many of your videos carry such a depressing tone.
Wow, truly brilliant video!  I don't disagree completely with your tactical stance on "rioting" however I'm not a pacifist and I defiantly disagree with pearl clutching and defending Nazis at the top of our lungs when they get punched in the face....   
damn this vid was savage... connected a lot of things I never thought of before.
Let me clear things up for you lefties: Trump won because #GamerGate wanted it to happen. We can make anything happen. We never lose.  Also, don't worry so much. We'll all be fine when Trump makes America great again.
So badly, so frequently, 13:30, there's your point made. Can't even digest.
i don't know what i enjoy more;      1) just simply us winning      or     2) cuckolds like you crying
I notice that you didn't bring up the fact that Trump was very popular among blacks and Hispanics. In fact he was the more popular with racial minorities since Romney, McCain, and Bush. But I have a feeling that you didn't mention that because it destroys your "Trump is wasist!" narrative. Or would you call those people "uncle toms" b/c they didnt vote the way you wanted. Also, where did Trump say that he's deport all Muslims and immigrants? I like that you at the very least condemned the riots. I do support being able to protest, and Trump has even said so himself. How fascist of him.
I don't think Trump is a villainous prick, and I think the left is overreacting.  But for the sake making my point, let's assume that Trump is what you say.  I think he could only be a true danger to this nation in a state of total war.  Once you order a million people to their deaths in defense of a nation, all reason is forgotten and ethnic and social cleansing becomes palatable.  I doubt even Hitler would have killed the Jews en masse without World War 2 as a precursor.  It would have been unconscionable, a step too far.  War fucks up the human mind.  I suggest watching US-China relations closely, because tensions look set to increase dramatically, and a hot war with China is the vector that could turn someone like the Trump into someone like Hitler or Stalin.  If the initial salvo with China doesn't completely obliterate both nations, the "total war" which follows could have grave consequences.

The bit at 9 minutes in where you discuss capitalism resulting in wealth being concentrated among a small group of people is wrong. The wealth of society is determined by the amount of goods and services available to its members. Through investments, economies of scale and technological innovation of individual companies the wealth of our society has increased immensely over the past few decades. Certainly there are those at the top who benefit the most, but this doesn't preclude the average person from having their wealth increased. Henry Ford was the epitome of rich white people, yet his company created some of the biggest increase in wealth of the people that history has ever know.
Capitalism doesnt create "wealth" , it creates "profit" and concentrate that profit in the hands of the Elites only. money and profit is not wealth
If liberal retards would realize that the problems (idpol) they wail about stems from how the economic system works, and if they weren't so fucking anti-guns they could maybe do something other than impotent rallies. If they want to call themselves leftists then I suggest they pick up some totally rad theory and share it with as many as they can. And they need to realize there is no end to hatred without a complete revolution of the economic system. The rest of the left is waiting but we're too few to do anything as it stands.
I respectfully disagree that rioting is inherently counterproductive. There are times when it becomes inevitable. As King said, rioting is the language of the unheard.  And this is really shallow, but can I say you look equally nice in both a sundress and in a flannel shirt? Not a lot of people can pull that off.
I was just listening to a 99% Invisible podcast episode about the ten letters Obama reads every night from Americans who send them in.  It strikes me as remote in the extreme that Trump will read ten letters a night from his constituents. I believe his capacity ends at around 140 characters.
It is comments like "Bernie failed to win the nomination", without any comments about Hillary basically being hand picked to be the Democratic candidate from the beginning, that really make this quite duvious. That and the "We right they facist" mentality.
One of the really disgusting things about America is Trump isn't morally inferior to the Clintons or Reagan or Obama.   Ruminate on this.   The DNC puts up the same shallow humanist pretenses typical of imperialist parties, while its party chiefs sexually abuse women ( Bill Clinton), commit genocides and wars (Hillary Clinton and Obama), and remain close friendships--not just cynical alliances--with terrorist states like Israel and Saudi Arabia and the Honduran coup government     Trump isn't atypical in anything but his open bravado. The emperor wears no clothes and that, from the point of view of the liberal establishment (in the true sense of the word liberal) is his sin--not his racist scapegoating or promise of extermination wars. These are long bipartisan traditions and fundamentally necessary to the maintenance of capitalism. But you're not supposed to admit it in front of the proles.   America: its got no right to exist.
serious question. Do you have any original thoughts, or are you just another buzzfeed SJW white guilt parrot?
I love your new videos. Please don't disappear again. I don't think I can handle this shit without you.
"How did Trump win" is the same question as "why did millions of individuals make X decision in a very politically complex republic"  It would take hours of serious discussion but that takes more homework than most people are willing to do or listen to and even subsequently summarize.
Would you consider making a video on why you support nonviolent protest? Especially given the wealth of writing around how violent protest is often (necessary or) the only means disenfranchised populations have to affect change.   I realize this question is very inflammatory, and I don't mean it as such, but I do think that violent protest isn't something that is openly discussed, and I'm not sure why, given the excess of topics on Youtube that are incredibly closed to open discussion (read: SJW, feminism, multiple genders, etc).
the electoral college is not confusing and takes about 3 minutes to explain
Christ!¬† You just make it up as you go.¬† I've skimmed a few others....¬† "ContraPoints" is actually simply contrarian.¬† Major muckraking.¬†¬† You'd fail badly in a moderated debate.¬† This format suits you though.¬† haha
Love the Mr. Plinkett impressions LOL
Where can i find more channels like this?
"He's going to fuck things up"  "People are going to blame him for everything that goes wrong"  I wish this would happen but I literally do not know what he could do or say that would disgrace him at this point. Especially in the eyes of his fans. Especially when anything negative against him is brushed aside as liberal propaganda. The post-fact society has made it so I doubt if he could ever be properly impeached.  If people believe things like Pizza Gate and disbelieve the scientific and media consensus on important issues there seems to me nothing negative they'll believe about their demagogue.
"What about the black and hispanic working class?"  Mass immigration hurts them too, probably even more so. Minorities broke for Trump more than Romney.  "Hillary's comparatively few misdeeds" Last I checked, Trump hasn't orchestrated the toppling of any governments.
This the Restoration all over again, I guess I'll go blind and write poetry.
You are underrated. Amazing channel.
Is it true that Hillary beat Sanders because of black and hispanic voters?  So, small sample size, but I work with lots of generally poor, mostly black and hispanic people, and they near-universally supported Sanders.
When you list the reasons of How the fuck did we get here, my answer is D, all of the above.  From Hillary being a historically bad candidate to Obama not being the change people wanted to the electoral college to republican voter suppression to international anti-establishment trends to fake news to Trump voters being racists ...  Almost everything that could go wrong has gone wrong for Hillary.
Thank you for your vids. You're my fav youtuber of 2016, dude. Thanks for being a fellow baltimoron (I say this w/ lots of love). Thanks for existing, hope you keep on raising intellectual hell next year.
8:07 worst thing about Trump in British politics is more Farage.
That satan line was very inspirational.
I don't agree with 100% of the things you said in this video. I'd give it a solid 98%. But I love your style, humor, and the way you present yourself. Keep up the good work!
This video is excellently written and delightfully well edited. Thanks for your quality work and nuanced handling of this divisive and inflammatory subject matter.
Twist ending :o
If Trump is the Jesus candidate as so many claim, then hail Satan indeed.
just go full marxist
Stop paying attention to the MSM. Their very framing is usually faulty. The media keeps saying 'white working class', whereas most of the actual leftist commentary on the economically struggling in this country is emphatic that it's working class people, period.  And Trump did not base his campaign mainly on bigotry. He spent a huge amount of time talking about the need to create jobs and invest in public infrastructure.  Trump flipped not just counties but entire states that went to Obama in the last election. His win was fundamentally about economics. A huge number of people who voted for him did so not because they like him but because his promises of real material improvements were sufficient to get voters to tolerate his many negative attributes.  Meanwhile Clinton offered nothing but insults and dismissal to the working class, while clearly banking on a rainbow coalition of, yes I'll use the phrase, identity politics subgroups to sweep her into the White House. Don't just look at who voted for Trump; look at the millions of past voters who didn't bother to even show up for Clinton. It isn't just because she specifically sucks (though she does, in spades). The Dems were also slaughtered in down ticket races. The party is now the weakest it's been at any point since 1928.  This election was a referendum on the New Democrat strategy of focusing on identity politics while ignoring issues of political economy while still expecting working people to vote for them. It took decades, but years of economic deprivation and betrayal have finally run the clock out on that strategy.   If all they're going to do is keep saying "vote for us, we love gays, women, and minorities!" while  continuing to pursue neoliberal Republican-lite economic policies that screw everyone equally (other than the top 10% donor class), then the Democrats  are doomed to go the way of the Whigs.   "The who?"   Yeah, exactly.
Wow, Hillary has the popular vote by 2.8 million as I'm writing this, and the turn out wasn't actually low.  Strange.  I thought this was a really thoughtful video, and it was well made.  Not as aesthi* (using a word you used in a different video) as some of your other videos, but it was still enjoyable.  I agree that you shouldn't riot if you're like, a white activist secure in the knowledge that nothing too terrible will happen to you if you do (as I am) because our insurrection mostly disaffects black people, poor people, etc.  BUT I do think that if riots happen in response to really heinous conditions, it's a call to examine why, not condemn how, they are revolting.
I just found out about your channel from an hbomber video comment and this video is amazing! One thing I think about though is the quote by JFK "Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."
Marmite isn't American
He's not "politically incorrect", he's just incorrect.
he reminds me of Andrew Jackson.
I still find the simplification of the political spectrum down to only 2 factors to be problematic & that problem is reinforced when discussing US politics as both parties are capitalist & only divided by Progressivism Vs Conservatism.  What we have in the US is the perception that Progressivism is moving too fast & maginalising conservatives causing progressive politics to be perceived as authoritarian to a conservative, hence the abandonment of the establishment for which ever rogue wheel that squeaks the most. Mixed with; The perception that things are not progressing fast enough to meet the changing & increasing demands of this new era due to the resistance of the establishment, hence the abandonment of the establishment by looking for a squeaky wheel to oil.  Meanwhile in reality, we are simply experiencing the dying throws of the Baby Boomers final conflict of power over their lives via their dominance of numbers as they trade long term legacy for the dream of short term luxury, again.
Hail Satan.
3:15 it would be funny if it was... Like me (never drank ever) becoming an alcoholic:D
I honestly can't believe my eyes when I see any minorities behind him in his speeches. It's like supporting someone who's planning to stab them in the back.
NATIONAL FUCKING BOHEMIAN. POLITICS ASIDE, YOU GOT MY RESPECT.
"Because Obama didn't save the apples"
Hillary is up by 2.5 million votes now!
You know there are actual Liberals, right? It's not just Marxism and it's brainchild, cultural Marxism. Have you heard of the "Free Soil Party?" They elected a President once. I believe it was a Mr. Martin Van Buren. When they say "Republicans Freed The Slaves," what they really mean is "The Free Soil party was integrated into the Republican Party and the Republicans took all of the credit for what they did."
Dude, what has become of you? You're literally making yourself look like Laci Green, except even she has the sense to have the tweets and headlines flash on the screen too fast for people to realize they don't support her claims. Stop smoking the feminist crack, shit's not good for you.
I agree with that question mark next to hippies at 6:41.  I think they were an attempt to tunnel under the wall.
this is like TUN for real life.
Worst tranny evar
hello friend my name dirjj just wanna tell u was good video esp part 3 i cannot word very well and always forget things so you did much better than i ever would
What a pussy cunt
you can say electoral college for Trumps win, but this is the first time Wisconsin has gone Republican since 1988.
this was an excellent video and honestly it was really refreshing to find such a logical and well researched view on the election. i would like to explain in my opinion as a person who voted for trump why me and my family voted the way we did. honestly hillary was the main reason that most people i know voted trump. and i know that after bernie lost the primary that he won. many of his supporters joined us. now many of us believe that trump is horribly misrepresented by the media. After some research i found that most media outlets are owned by big business and that CEO doesn't like trump. but he is a still an asshole. just not the racist, antigay, nazi that everyone paints him out to be. my family voted for him just because we didn't want hillary to win and you can attribute that directly to the leaked emails that were confirmed to be true. inside those documents were records of horrible atrocities and awful conspiracy's, racial slurs, and the picture of a sociopath that i would not trust with my life or even 5 of my dollars much less the entire country. all this being said it was between a rock and a hard place but we are happy with our decision. thank you for reading this and thank you for such an informed video.
You said it, Satan!
Hilarious.
You saying that Trump's campaign was against LGBT community really shows how much you know about the subject. Trump never said anything that should make gay people afraid, he even said that he would protect their rights on many occasions. Your understanding of what Trump stands for is based on lies and mischaracterization. At least he didn't threaten to start a nukelar war with Russia.
Natty Boh!
I've been a long time subscriber of yours and I've always appreciated your insight. This video was really well-written and watching it made me feel a little bit more hopeful about this disaster, and that's something I suppose.  Thanks, Nick.
"The US has a pretty robust welfare state"   Sorry that's complete nonsense...The US doesn't even have universal healthcare or taxpayer-funded higher education...our welfare state is absolute shit  Canada, and the northern EU countries and Norway have robust welfare states
This is brilliant, you are beautiful, Hail Satan. Also, I have the same kimono, which is...hot?
I love how your picture for teenagers was a bunch of emo kids hahahahaha!!!!
boo dislike
2016 has been a great year for the populist right. Let's see if the wind keeps blowing their way next year. The French Presidential election could have huge repercussions for us here in Europe and the wider world.  Your videos are awesome and you're beautiful :)
I enjoy your video.  Is still bothers me when you somehow give expression that marxist is good. Even this ideology before ww2 has killed 3 million "white army" in russia under Lenin. There are no exact figures on the number of people killed in Stalin's terror. Some estimates are as low as a million, some as high as ten million. (A conservative estimate is 3 million.) And after second ww2 The total figure of civilians deliberately killed under Stalinism, around six million. Indeed it was Stalin, not Hitler, who initiated the first ethnic killing campaigns in interwar Europe.  And do you find this familiar somehow with SJW:  The Stalin regime never accepted the idea that its own planning could be to blame: instead, they would hunt out the internal enemies who "must be to blame." These alleged class enemies (etc) would be arrested, sent to labor camps, deported to Siberia or Central Asia, or shot.   And beyond the numbers killed remains the question of intent.  Most of the Soviet killing took place in times of peace, and was related more or less distantly to an ideologically informed vision of modernization.

Making witty videos and speaking with a thesaurus doesn't make you smart. You're nothing but a willfully ignorant fool who lives in an echo chamber to give yourself confirmation bias.
Down with trump. Hail Satan! LOL!
Still better than Hillary.
Fun video, and quite informative, even if I am half-and-half on the assertion that riots are a no-no. I've been encouraging some of my friends to take up self-defence courses to protect themselves from white supremacists and violent dirtbags, and checking in on my friends in Amerika more often to make sure they haven't been jumped coming home from work.
sorry but trump won because of you. we normals dont like you who act all superior and want us to conform. a lot of trumps victory is attributated by your smigness.
What do you think of Assange/Wikileaks' role in leaking information about Clinton, while being oddly quiet when it comes to leaking info about Trump? I mean, not even his tax information was leaked...
This was the most intelligent response to the election I've seen so far. My respect for you just shot up 10 points.
gud video
Not enough semi-nude shots in this video :'(  :'(  :'(
I dunno how I'm just now noticing this video. but congrats on actually making an original video about this/not just reading out your tweets in video form
LOL Patreon username: no no no   xd
6:35-7:07 Did it have to come to this for your lot to realise what the _classical liberals_ have been telling you for the past few years? === Calling it a 'tantrum' is taking it too lightly. The disaffection that sections of whites feel for 'New Left' society in which they are casually and constantly derided would fit seamlessly into a Ralph Ellison or James Baldwin novel.
None violent protest your such a wetty holding up placards and saying a hay ho Ho you need to root to make them wake up and then the people would become to hard to control and then change will happpen
Love the video... But i feel the need to point out how fascism had always been propelled by upper and middle class interest in times of crises and especially against left wing ideas. Bienno Russo, two years of factory occupations and left wing militancy led to the upper classes and capitalists calling on Mussolini to save them a similar situation happened in Germany. to say it is a race revolution is to ignore massive amounts of evidence and conplexities regarding capitalism and fascism. I understand your doing generalisations but it creates a false narrative where fascism is portrayed as just the same as socialism which is absolutely is not.
Absolutely GREAT video!"Down with Trump!Hail,Satan!"............exactly.
You might be the only intelligent person on YouTube. I'm still not giving you my money.
Thank you for this video. It's brilliant and well argued and just fantastic over all.
I will speak without shame. If you choose to treat my comment with scorn and derision, feel free.  What exactly are Trump voters supposed to do so that they might "take responsibility for harmful rhetoric"?   I'm genuinely at a loss at how to even understand the perspective of people who have said this sort of thing. I agree its absolutely true that what Trump said was BORDERLINE inappropriate. Note that I say borderline because I never heard him actually say anything explicitly horrible.  The three examples levied are 1) illegal (Mexican) immigrants who cross the border commit lots of crimes, 2) We need a "ban" on Muslims immigrating to the country, and 3) Trump brags about grabbing pussies.  1 and 2 have differences, but are similar enough that they ought to be addressed together. In neither of these instances was something outright racist said. They're things that need to be addressed. The cartels ARE a problem, militant Islam infiltrating refugee systems ARE  a problem. They're not something that you can just push under the rug; however, Trump was the only candidate who has actually had the appearance of taking these things seriously.  I say appearance, because I don't know that Trump is actually trustworthy, but then we get into the issue that we KNOW every other candidate who was running was certainly not trustworthy, so at least he's not them.  The point I'm making here is that these topics have been treated with such scorn and derision (not out of political correctness, but out of partisan power dynamics) that nearly half the country doesn't even trust the people who claim that these statements are racist, sexist, or whatever.  There's a real problem with the tactics of the left that these claims about prejudice and bigotry are ignored by about half the country. Is Trump racist/sexist/whatever, maybe, but that's not the issue. The issue is that half the country no longer trusts the people who have made that claim so often about so many people that many people don't even listen anymore. Its not about rebelling about political correctness. Its about a significant portion of the country not buying into the narrative that is constantly proposed.  We can blame Rush and talk radio all we want, and I'm certain they have quite a bit to do with it; but I really think the self denial about the effectiveness of the lefts tactics is in severe denial. Don't get me wrong, the right has many problems too, but its simply too easy to blame others instead of actually doing some self reflection. And, I mean no offense, but I didn't see anything on your video about what you could have done better. If enough of the country disagrees with you enough to win the presidency, the practical thing isn't to blame the electoral college, its to reevaluate the tactics you're using to pursue political power.  With respect to 3, its much less intricate. Are those things bad to say? Yes. Has everyone said something terrible to that effect? Yes. Does it mean that Trump is a creepy misogynist? maybe, perhaps even probably. However, given the ubiquity of the problem in each of us, and given how deep the media goes into all our personal lives, its no wonder that half of the country were willing to forgive it. 50 years ago, that statement never would have came out. The only reason why we hear candidates say things like that is because of the technogical expansion in the past 50 or 60 years or so. We're still catching up with that.  Our time is not much different from the time that written language was just being invented in human history. Plato wrote about that, and that was a few hundred years AFTER that history changing technological advancement was made.   The point being in all this, what exactly is there to take responsibility for when the people who disagreed with the left's narrative and decided to vote for trump don't think there was anything wrong enough with that rhetoric to vote for him. I'm left thinking that you're just perpetuating the same losing strategy: shame. It worked for quite a while, but eventually people will just become immune to that emotion. There's the hedonic treadmill, and then there's also the Cynic treadmill (Cynic being used here in terms of the philosophers of the ancients and not in terms of the colloquial term). If you keep shaming views, eventually people will just reach a state of normalcy when it comes to shame, and they won't feel shame from it anymore.  That's not a rejection of political correctness, that's political correctness becoming impotent.  And I'm not saying that the right doesn't use its own clearly ineffective tactics, but I don't really see what you've said here that was new. It seems what you've said is simply just keep doing more of the same. Maybe it'll work, but it will not because of your merit but because of chance.  Oh, and Nick, I'm sorely disappointed with you Romantic interpretation of Satan in Paradise Lost. You know, its pretty evident that William Blake (while he's one of my top five favorite poets) obviously never read past book 1.   I hate to quote this because usually you're so good with your analysis, but you've really missed the mark with the Blake/Alinsky allusion. They made the mistake with Satan from Paradise lost and you're perpetuating it. So I've got to quote the man who got it right:  "A little learning is a dangerous thing; Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring : There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain, And drinking largely sobers us again."
Thank you. This is a great video.
This video is pretty cringy, "I dare him to build that fucking wall". The way your twink ass said that was pretty cringy, anyway Democrats are evil. I hope you all die of cancer or something  offensive and edgy like that.
Nice echo-chamber we have here in this comment section.
Impressive! You really get to the heart of "complicated" shit & present it in the simplest possible way. Way to go! Fantafuckingbulous stuff!
11:20 Because that ideology is really epitomized by the current state of affairs.
First and foremost, I would like to start off by saying that I wasn‚Äôt rooting for Trump, and wouldn‚Äôt have voted for him if I were a U.S citizen. I would probably vote my conscience and cast my vote to Gary Johnson, if I were to vote at all. But make no mistake about it,Trump is INDEED the natural result of the regressive left's highly politically correct, anti-white, anti-male and anti- American rhetoric. Constantly demonizing the people you disagree with, painting them as racists and oppressors and telling them that any and all of their successes are a result of some unearned "privilege," is not very likely to solicit a positive response or an understanding.  Trump is the consequence of the regressive left's actions, its rhetoric, and the identity politics it brought into American politics. And while it is indeed true that most people probably didn't go to the polls with social media culture wars in mind, I don't think one can easily dismissed the constant outrage manufacturing by the regressive left in desensitizing the public to Trump's behavior that was genuinely outrageous.  And while I was never enthusiastic about Trump, and I still don't believe he's gonna be a good president(although not what the SJW doom-mongers think he will be), the ocean of tears flowing from all the morally narcissistic crybully SJWs following a his victory is indeed a once in a lifetime delight.   As bad of a character Trump may be, and as bad as his presidency may turn out to be, his election victory in the context of the lunacy of the SJWs can probably be viewed as a form of chemotherapy. A pretty nasty process, with lots of bad side effects, but one that may be necessary to remove, or at the very least, send into remission the cancerous tumor of SJW "thinking"(a very charitable term when applied to this mindset). Whether Trump will do some major blunders that will offset any gains from demoralizing SJWs, is something that only time will tell. The left at this point has two choices: Repudiate its regressive wing to deprive the flames of the nastier elements of Trump's campaign from their vital oxygen, or double down on its moral narcissism and pour more gasoline into those flames. May the left choose wisely.
I was riding a low wages bus the other day, and an elderly woman said that Trump would "keep us from becoming a socialist country". It occurred to me that this woman would have to be relying on social services based on using this bus network, her age and the region of the country we both live in. However, right wing mythology has taught her to fear any attempt by government to help her, while worshiping rich CEOs as shining knights coming to rescue us all from the tyranny of public service. The brainwashing is so complete that I can't help but feel that it might be too late for that generation of Americans.
At least you're not making a v√≠deo triggered by Trump being compared to TWD's Negan.
Why haven't I heard of this channel until now? Hail Satan!
With the Democratic Party, keep in mind she did win with a rigging from the DNC as evidence by the Wikileaks whistle blow
Missing the point 10:00 , many white look down on welfare because they view it as undignified, a failure on their part to need it. Also it is viewed as method of control. Part of the reason so in regard to you comment on welfare v race you have the causality backward.  they view needing welfare as a failure > They see other racial demographics using welfare more than them which if they are poor breeds a sense of 'I am doing this on my own why aren't you'. > which leads to great racial tensions. Then add on things like affirmative action being based on race not economic means and that further adds fuel to the fire.   Also add on to  that for the past 5-10 year it has been really apparent the social justice in many ways is just a mean of painting over the left neo liberalism. Sorry but to me (as someone tepidly part of the old left) social justice is side dish. having social justice as a main dish and benching economic issues merely in the long run breed racial resentment (both way). why? tribalism, its part of our psychology. tribalism can be countered, but only through a prosperous demos. when resources are scarce this kick the tribalism back into play.  its lizard brain bullshit but it needs to be acknowledge to make progress and counter.  the economic half of the left has been in retreat since the 70's. social justice has been on the rise. When ever i hear the social justice half of the left maek statement that would put social justice ahead of economic issues all i can hear is 'muh neo liberalisms'. It way to convenient and gets the eyes off of all the right  people/issues. it not like race has never been used to divided before./s   You want to appeal to white, working class voters? (just the working class really, but race matters now apparently. ) you either need to appeal to them through work (ie union jobs), job training/education, some form of relocation assistance or you need to convince them the needing welfare doesn't make them a failure.  both are equally difficult TBH. also article like alternet no empathy for white voters if going to demotivate the reluctant clintonites  in 2018 and 2020. why vote for party that is going to hate you for existing? that is how it reads to them (it also shift blames on the voter rather than the DNC and HRC being shit [for reals yo, they are dodging more blame than neo in matrix and they and their cronies are eating more steak than cipher] ). Also the dnc need to be worried because if the trend continues they could lose the rust belt in 2018 2020, and for a long while, and trump enrode in to minorities voter most notably hispanics should be worrying as FUCK.    Honestly trumps win probably wasn't crushing enough for the DNC to learn, and if a new party isn't formed ASAP, or the DNC doesn't learn, the left will be dead for generation. best case 4-8 years and this is the left mccain and or romeny. also i hate to say it. but bernie was to weak, the left if it has any hopes of winning needs a left wing trump. Brash offensive, and willing to bear the arrow at his back. a lot the left that i see doesn't seem up to that fight.
It's gonna be a long four years. It's not even Trump that worries me, it's Mike Pence. I really do not understand how all these Trump supporters were convinced they were electing someone who wasn't part of the Washington establishment, an outsider, yet didn't bat an eye when he picked  a VP who is the most stereotypical Christian Conservative whitebread Governer. I don't like throwing around this word, but he's literally a homophobe.  Also hahahah @ 14:00. Thank you for promoting NON VIOLENT protests! Americans have the right to protest, but we do not have the right to vandalize and cause property damage, as well as hurting people! wtf.
*_Don't drag me into your mortal calamities! I have my own problems._* Lmfao...honestly tho, I didn't know that old YouTubers like you were still active. Excellent Video!
Time is bad, but do you know what will help? A good dinner, a well done steak perhaps with a lot of salt. Oh yummy!
I always like the classical music in your videos
Poor to upper middle class rural racist whites voted for Trump, that is why the average income is higher for Trump voters. Keep in mind, poor folks (of any race really) in the rust belt (and elsewhere) that normally vote blue might have skipped out on voting all together because of a lack of Sanders on the ballot.  I think its the combination of these factors that ultimately got Trump in the white house (well, and the electoral college) energized racist and paranoid whites and sapped energy from a critical voter block for democrats, leaving them vulnerable.
Of course Satan has a British accent
Rashomon was a perfect reference to make in this video, and exactly the film I was thinking about all day on November 9th. I've been leaning on Kurosawa--along with Kobayashi--a lot before and after the election. The political situation they were in was a lot worse than anything I've experienced and those films are a result of that. The things they have to say through their art are so incredibly important.  Granted, it's disturbing to relate to those films. But they're also getting me through this crap, so I guess it's worthwhile.
I'm 3:21 into this video and you've lost my viewership. I was going to switch off earlier but you asked that we give you a chance. Another minute into the video and you're still spouting shit. If your intention was really to speak to the "white men" who elected Trump and get across a reasonable message; bashing those people and acting like this election is a fucking tragedy isn't the way to go. You're just another butthurt Hillary supporter, and yes, you're precisely why I'm glad Trump won. You've lost a viewer and a subscriber. In future, try to be less of a doomsayer and be more rational and reasonable; demonising half the fucking country is not how you start a dialogue.
I dislike your politics but not such a bad video.
The SPLC are themselves arguably a hate group, so you shouldn't be quoting them as though they are some sort of authority.
If you want to know why Trump won, ask the people who voted for him.  This is something journalists would never think to do.
Red father Marx, Dark mother Saarkesian. Antichrist their Child. Old left and New left, united at long last.Hail Satan! 2020!
Oh wow that was excellent
WHY DIDNT THIS POP UP IN MY SUB FEED FUCK SAKES. Anyway, I love you. I cant give you money but have a like. Also, you are going to have to start addressing the idiocracy from the skeptics on youtube soon. I think you know this. ALSO FUCK MILO YIANNOPOULOS HE FUCKING PANDERED TO THE WHITE MALES THAT THE DEMS FUCKED OVER AND LOOK WHO IS THE CHIEF STRATEGIST???? FUCKING ASSHOLE AT BREITBART. Im insane.
EXTREMELY MINOR POINT (feel free to ignore): Actually, it was Carter who first began the rollback of the welfare state, though I agree Reagan accelerated it and was a definite turning point.
with your videos i disagree with few to many points yet i'm entertained in a non-lolcow way and have no urge to correct you  you have a gift use it wisely
Excellent video, man, and it's the divided coalition that's been hitting me most. We've been seeing a lot of "Crab Bucket" type actions, disadvantaged groups turning on each other for trying to improve their lot in life, resulting in no one getting better.  A lot of the time, it's like arguing which is better, having a broken arm or having a broken leg. Both suck. Both should get better. Just because something doesn't help you doesn't mean it's bad for you...  ...but when you're living in one-room shithole because your bosses can get away with paying you crap, it can be hard to remember that :(.
What If I AM an ethnic minority half Native half Latino and IM EXTREMELY HAPPY that Trump won because I think PC culture is bullshit and I think that SJW's and Twitter warrios don't help the 45 MILLION Americans  living below the poverty line IN THE SLIGHTEST and I'm also happy that Hillary lost because she stole the election from Bernie? What do you think about that? ALSO SCREW SJW's DON'T EVER TALK IN THE NAME OF NATIVE AMERICANS OR LATINOS EVER AGAIN.
Only video of You I'm disliking this far.  4. Keep in mind that saudi arabia and qatar are the main supporters of ISIS, and they also were among hilarys backers in the campaign! 1.You completely left out Ron Paul when talking about candidates with solutions to the problem. Or was it because he ran as a conservative? 2.You left out that the bombardment of ISIS is mainly why Trump sees Putin the way he is. 3. You failed to mention the Gas-Line!  One more bias video and I'm unsubbing.
Despair was spelled incorrectly, all your points are therefore invalid.
It boggles my mind that educated voters voted for Trump. Our college professors really need to step up their indoctrination.
Well, here is the unsaid thing about your divide: Clinton is right wing, as is most of the Democratic party. The first Clinton did little more than continue Reagan's policy, he only followed it a bit closer to the right wing's dogma: constrain in buget, while Regan and Bush sent the debt to the skies. And, once again, the reason Sanders wasn't the nominee is just that. The party is right wing and connected to the money from big business. So, a bit of fraud goes a long way: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_mJ5KutY8s&t=125s
hail satan
Almost everything you said was incorrect and not based on reason or logic, I don't even know where I'd begin.  I'd like to ask why you never mentioned wikileaks though, do you even know wtf happened?
I know people like to bash Trump in the comment section, but do note that a big part of this video is about how he won the election, which is the student loans getting out of control, big American companies getting much cheaper labor overseas, and quite possibly one of the most flawed voting systems in the world. I just hope the healthcare system will continue to improve (the idea is good, the execution is horrible) but only time will tell now what Trump will do with it. Trump definitely has slowed down now that he won, and I think a lot of his talk was an act. I will judge him by his actions as president. (For better or worse)
Part uno: What happened?  Part deux: How did it happen? But before we answer that, we need to answer what happened...  Wut?
So that was the best Trump think piece I've seen so far. Gonna share the crap outta this.
Sorry to nitpick, but I don't think Fascism is simply a revolution unified by race; because a nation can contain more than one 'race' or ethnicity if these share what inhabitants consider a respectable enough bond (usually a 'historic' bond). Of course the most famous historical examples did include the factor 'race'. My main point is that fascism, instead of 'a revolution against capitalism along racial lines', is instead a revolution against capitalism through authority; a strong state and a highly stratified social order (with a leader) based on the ability to inflict continual violence; and seeing 'the beauty of violence' etc.   Violence and strength, the state and hierarchy I think are much much more important in fascism than race.

A British humor show pointed out that in one way Trump's election is a victory for progressives: he's shown that in America even a crazy person can be elected to the highest office in the land. He's totally shattered the rubber padded ceiling.
Who is that narrating Satan's line from Paradise Lost at the end? The voice is so familiar, it's driving me nuts.
Your videos are some of the best things in the universe
But if Trump eventually resigns and the Trump detractors go "See? Dude just bailed and didn't improve anything in the slightest." The Trump defenders will just go "That's because you bullied him. Poor guy."  Calling it now.
Satan 2020!
Can't we riot a bit? Please?
Hail Satan.
Cynical, smug, elitist, defeatist, pretentious, hyperbolic, overtly biased, grossly uncharitable garbage wrapped in a thin veil of satirical humor. Unbelievable. Why is it so difficult for otherwise intelligent anti-Trump people to voice their concerns and criticisms in a _reasonable_, non-idiotic fashion? It's just baffling to me. And the irony here is that people like you _actually_ believe you're being thoughtful and objective when you spew this kind of partisan nonsense. Your heads are buried so far deep inside your own asses that you've lost all (not all) sense of reality, including your sense of objectivity and fair-mindedness.  There are many reasons why Trump won, and speaking as one very reluctant Trump voter, I can tell you with absolute confidence that people like _you_ and smear videos like _this_ are among them. Hopefully, Trump will be a successful president and that will finally serve as a wake-up call for all you naysaying elitist snobs to realize that maybe, just maybe, you're not as smart and in-tune as you think you are.

Very concise analysis...and in the style of Redlettermedias Mr. Plinkett videos. Double props!
Around 70% of people in US are white. If it's a democracy, surely it's no surprise white interests win?  Hispanic and black voters don't decide anything, why is there so much focus on them?
Great summary of the situation. I would also recommend Richard Wolff take on it, it's a very economic-oriented one, but there is a lot to learn there: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPDd9cibY9A
Great video, but not enough kinky shit in it.
Anti-fascist self-defence and community organisation are a must.
"nonviolent protests" don't help people. Self Defense and Direct Action are the most effective ways of defending the disadvantaged (Black Panther Party and Antifa are good examples of this).
Keep buying into msm and acting like you can predict the future bro. Can your next video be about natural selection?
Your videos are always such a pleasure. For non-Americans like myself, CGP Grey's videos on the electoral college explain things very well.
You're one of the few who echo my own thoughts, like when I've calmed my own vitriol enough to actually think.
It's worth noting that Trump got a significant increase in percentage of voters who make less than 30K than other republicans (and won in the white subset), so the average income of his voters may be somewhat high but there was a shift in that demographic.  He also increased the republican percentage in all racial/ethnic minority categories (despite his rhetoric) so i don't think you could say that he was depending on white voters more than other republicans usually do.  (this comes from someone who doesn't like and didn't vote for trump)
Why is it everyone's so certain they know why Trump won? Have they ever considered it's a combination of multiple reasons all coming together in a tornado of delightful chaotic destruction?
I don't think choosing satan as your inspiration is a good idea, he loses in the end and the only thing he achieves is dragging down others with him.
I guess we'll see... in quiet terror. God damn it! First Brexit and now this? Can't I catch a break?!
I predict his inauguration day will be the most protested one in history.
One thing I might guess on was that I'm pretty sure democrats, and the left in general, probably thought this would be an easy win. Even if they didn't like Hillary, no one would vote for a buffoon like Trump.  No one was gonna take Trump seriously, but then a lot of people did. And here we are now, stuck with an uncertain future.  I was initially saying that I don't fear Trump, but the more decisions he makes, the more questions I have and the more nervous I become.
the scary thing ACTUALLY it was ALL OF THOSE THINGS that made him win. every single last point. That's terrifying. It's counter culture capitalism gone amok
I binge watched this youtube channels videos. I WANT MORE! (In demon voice)
Still better than the other candidate.
Look, here, I'm going to tell you the real reason why Trump won.  And it isn't about policy or demographics or identity politics.  Trump won because Hillary didn't inspire people to vote for her.  She's old news and boring as fuck.  I mean seriously, did you liberal idiots expect people to come out in droves to vote for an old political grandma who has been involved in countless scandals and is in the pocket of big business?  Hillary had no narrative.  Ask yourselves, why did Obama win?  Because he had a narrative that captivated and inspired people.  Did Hillary inspire the masses of new voters, women and minorities like Obama did?  Fuck no. Only the establishment.  So the Democrats got what they deserve and in my opinion, we will all be better off for it in the long run.
Keep it up bro!
About the employment of violence... You forgot mention how he picked a crazy creationist as a vice president. Killing him will put someone even worse in the white house. Ha! Cheeky bastard...
Hail satan!
Hail Satan. so fuckin pissed about this election...
Don't leave this time please!
Down with Trump! Hail Satan!
Yet another insightful and wonderfully put together video.  It's always a treat watching your creations.   As you pointed out, there are numerous reasons why the election turned out as it did, but I don't think we can gloss over what PC culture has done.  I'm quite left-leaning, which is why I think it's important to be critical about the side I usually want to root for.  I've watched ideologies that once emphasized compassion for the downtrodden and awareness for those who are marginalized, become a weapon.  I know people who barely check social media anymore because they are tired of being told who they're supposed to hate in the name of a social issue.  I find this extremely sad since it alienates people who might have been sympathetic from hearing about important social concerns.    Political correctness has gone from bringing awareness about how to avoid saying something that might seem callous to people different from yourself, to a Joseph McCarthy-like witch hunt online against some people whose offenses are often a matter of subjective interpretation.    All this is a horrible reason to vote for Trump, to be sure (and I doubt it was a significant one); but I still think many on the left need to strongly reevaluate how they approach discussions on social issues.
silly boy, there's no such thing as being "overly marxist" =p
Your characterization of why Bernie lost the primaries skips : http://caucus99percent.com/content/election-fraud-study-authors-respond-critics  Hillary's comparatively few misdeeds.  https://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/55463/hillary-clinton#.WC5rNGorLtQ https://medium.com/@ronaldwdixon/the-long-list-of-reasons-why-i-will-never-vote-for-hillary-clinton-5cb1ab31b28e#.5a2qpy3u0  Seriously it's very hard to not feel this video implies a blind spot in favor of your chosen candidate.
What happened with the comments??
This is either my favorite video of yours or your best video yet.  Many thanks.  I may even do a response/ shout out. I'll have to see.  Again: great stuff!  Your efforts are appreciated.
Question Nyk: How do you feel about Huey Long? He's a very fascinating figure in US political history, yet almost nobody seems to know about him.  For the uninitiated: Huey P Long was a politician from Louisiana in the 1920s and 30s. He was known as a populist leftist, and wanted a massive empowerment and expansion of government. Before his assassination, lots of people feared that he was going to run for and win the presidency once FDR was gone.
Babe- and I hope I can call you that because I officially have to- this was brilliant. Hail Satan.
Satan 2020 Make America delicious again
Another well-thought-out analysis, however, I disagree with the riot part. Whoever is brave enough to risk their lives and freedom rioting, should probably do it. Brutal policing is there *regardless* and continues to worsen. They don't need riots to excuse an increase in brutality of an already militarizing police force. In fact, IF they want to leverage extreme-violence, they can *easily* create riots themselves to justify their pre-meditated atrocity. Peaceful protests have their place, but *so do riots*. So the least people can do make some real ones to let the corporate monstrosities, politicians, and the propagandists whose job it is to anesthetize the public into believing that riots are not necessary and can never effect change, that *_shit just got serious_*.. Oh, and a small meme from libcom.org for good measure: http://i.imgur.com/oF8cI8t.jpg
Fantastic video. I am glad you're back for these interesting times
You used too nice an image for the the hypothetical racist
Wow, this was a really impressive analysis of the factors that led up to Trump.
We don't have to riot for them to vilify us and use it to justify more brutal police crackdowns.  Listen to the Trumpers talk about the protesters for any amount of time at all and you'll see they already assume protests and riots are the same thing.  The top image on imgur two days after the election was about how rioters are evil and the top comment for that image was from some white store owner saying he was "scared for [his] life" because the protesters were outside.  Note, the protesters hadn't actually done anything TO him, but the idea of black people grouped together and shouting was enough to make him have a meltdown.  That comment had over 2000 net upvotes.  Even MLK was accused of leading riots under the guise of peaceful protest.  I don't expect "don't riot" to be effective advice.
bernie sanders isn't a socialist. sanders is a new left styled social democrat that on occasion appropriates alt-left populist rhetoric as a logistics tactic. he also has nominal third party views.
do you think collective workers ownership of the means of the production is plausible?
how do you identify politically? what do you think about old left style social democracy?
I notice you started with the media narrative of an uptick in racist attacks (most of which turned out to be false). Whilst totally ignoring the rioting and assaults by left protesters. Coincidentally that is why you lost and will continue to lose until you catch a clue.
I feel like the old left/new left divide is correct to an extent, although coming from a very far left marxist/communist political space which you might class as 'old left', I feel like 'identity politics' are supported very heavily, but with the main root of these problems being explored through economic means. There is a lot of focus on LGBT rights, intersectional feminism is considered a must for the far left and there is a large focus on making sure people from more marginalised groups are represented. The people the far left/old left despise is the liberal left, who will claim to advocate for women's rights, LGBT rights and black liberation, but are afraid or unwilling to dismantle the institutions and economic systems that allow these injustices to occur in the first place. For example, they will leave a Black Lives Matter hashtag on a facebook post, but will condemn protests and riots by BLM supporters for being 'violent' or getting in the way on their drive to work. So I guess I see the divide more like radical left vs. liberal left. Sorry this is a really bad comment, hopefully it makes some sense, I love your videos and they're very well made and refreshing to see on the cesspool that is Youtube.
Shoehorning people into "identity" boxes is what is perpetuating these problems and they will never go away until we choose to stop doing it. You are more part of the problem than part of the solution.
I'm famous now. Danke!! üòÉ
Hold on: the housing bubble AND tuition bubble were brought on by the government providing guaranteed loans, artificially spiking demand beyond what the market would've.  And, to that problem the solution is "more of the same".  The left is nefarious indeed.
Yes! (for "not to do "  tips) and thank you for best  rounded insight I've read/seen  in attempt to understand what happened  (all looks such a mess for us far away from US)
How is Trump racist, and what racist policies are you afraid he'll enact?  Clinton was a bought and sold warmonger, and I'd take nearly anyone over her.
Thanks to all the lefties and democrats, who got Trump elected. I love you for this.
NOT. ENOUGH. BOH. NEED MORE BOH.
Good video as always ContraPoints. I just have to disagreements. The first is about Reason Magazine, that you cite as a right wing media outlet. And I can see where this is comming: they write a lot of silly stuff about "poltical correctness", in a similar but more sophisticaded and reasonable way, which is not difficult,  that the right  against Political Correctness. But if you read them with more care, they were extremely critical on Donald Trump, they called him on their xeonphobia and racism, and refused to give any truce to his populist rethoric. The second is on rioting. I am not for rioting in general, but I don¬¥t think violence cannot be justified in some point to fight what looks clearl a fascist regimen. I guess it depends on the circunstances that may lead or not to violence and how such violence is executed.
You had me until you threw out revolutionary options. Liberalism is just another dead end on the road to revolution.
I enjoyed hearing your thoughts on this matter. Thank you.
What seems odd to me is that a lot of political commentators appear blind to the passage of time outside the single year of a candidate's campaign. "It's because of RACISTS!" completely ignores that states who voted Obama twice in a row now voted Trump, and it also completely ignores the growing dissatisfaction with what can only be described as hostility towards whites coming from the left wing. Of course, not all of these left wing sources are associated with Hillary directly, but they do all support her, and if (as the media has repeated ad nauseum for the last year) the KKK supporting Trump makes Trump a white supremacist, people such as Laci Green and Franchesca whatsherface supporting Hillary makes Hillary anti-white. There's also the BLM, there's colleges across the country instituting classes to 'teach men not to rape' as though all men are to be assumed rapists in waiting, the list goes on and on, and it has been happening for years.  Very little of this is directly related to Trump or Hillary's campaign, but it is all part of a prevalent narrative which a lot of people are getting fed up with, and Trump is the only candiidate willing to go against the one common thread seeming to bind it all together: Identity Politics. Of course, since none of it is directly tied to either campaign, most political commentators don't even look at it, because how could something not directly related to one of the campaigns have any sort of impact on the election?
Awesome as always.  Your videos are really a cut above.
real Donald trump is really his?
As always, Keep Cool But Care
Can I encourage Mike Pence to go hunting with Dick Cheney?
Is someone watching the atheists? Who¬¥s complaining about Trump¬¥s denial of climate change and he appointing a creationist?
Hope you are right.
14:00 Trump supporters will never apologize for his hateful rhetoric because they always handwave everything he says away as "just lockerroom talk" or "strictly about immigration" or "about national safety."  A dog called by a whistle, nodding enthusiastically, later to claim, "I didn't hear shit"
I often compared Trump with Milton's Satan, but Trump lacks Satan's charisma, dignity, and other Byronic qualities.   But just like you said, its better to reign in hell than to serve in heaven.
Was hoping to see you do a video on this. Great work. Out of curiosity, do you have a script with footnotes or something? I'd be down to follow some of them.
You're the best, Contra. Better than the best, you're huge.
Trump won these election quite Bigly, because he got a lot of support all over the country, whereas Hillary did good only in the major cities. Why Trump got so much support? Because his message of change seemed to resonate with people. Hillary was not a very good candidate, Bernie would have probably won.
Good video, you are one of my favorite persons in youtube.
I found strange confort in Contrapoints despiste the bleakness I feel right now
There is evidence of possible fraud http://tdmsresearch.com/2016/11/10/2016-presidential-election-table/ https://www.youtube.com/attribution_link?a=HJjai6GabYA&u=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DpC8l-0e3pd0%26feature%3Dshare
+ContraPoints Bernie didn't win because the Dnc was actively working against him and working for the Clinton campaign. Also shitty laws like the ones in New York State suppressed independent voters during the primary. You should do a whole video on it after you research all of it because you sound quite uneducated in the matter. I usually like your content but come the fuck on if you think Hillary legitimately won the primary.
You honestly claiming white people don't care about the struggles of other races? it's only the white people that give a shit so much so they throw themselves under the bus and blame themselves for all the ills of the world even though they are the only ones that ended shit like slavery, honestly think blacks give a shit about minorities in their countries? no they do the opposite and murder them same with middle eastern countries its insane the amount of brainwashing the white race have to hate themselves.  people voted for Trump because most are fed up with all this bullshit plus Hilary was a total scum bag.  BTW i dont even believe in any voting system in politics it's all a show hillary and trump are best friends.
Hail Satan
All through history, if you take away peoples hope enough... eventually they just figure sod it... and rebel.. Let those damn rabble eat cake... Lets lock ourselves in the summer palace whilst the proles riot dear... Lets all wear Lederhosen and slap our thighs like in the good old days and point fingers at those nasty others...  Moneterism doesnt work... trickle down economics doesnt trickle, people need the ability to work themselves out of poverty. If your Maslows triangle hasnt got a base to stand on, well fuck it... where are the pitchforks honey, we have an uprising to attend.... oh and stick it in that orange fellow as you go past, we dont need him any more.
Donald Cunt
Reason magazine is not "right wing media"-- unless every political point of view that you may disagree with gets to be labelled as right wing, and I don't think that's an intellectually healthy paradigm.  I also think it's rather shortsighted to suggest that people on the left should be Marxists.
The future is so bright I don't need eyes to see it.
Oi, the road rage incident and the shitting clips you used have been debunked http://www.snopes.com/clinton-supporter-defecated-on-sign/ http://www.snopes.com/black-mob-beats-white-man-for-voting-trump/
Great video as always, but, you should really know better than to call Bernie Sanders a a socialist. He is not a socialist.
dude.... I love your videos. ordinarily I would give less than 0.0002 shits about this topic but I am now strangely interested
Nailed it. Was dreading this as I keep seeing liberals on youtube just stumble over their own feet, its painful to watch. One minor point of contention: Do not riot, unless its organized with a specific goal in mind that benefits you. Not all riots or violent protests should be discounted. We are living in a very violent world and violence is a language and a tool for everybody, not just "the oppressor".
Rashomon? Why Rashomon? Thats not how I remember it ;)
The problem was economic anxiety but according to the right, that problem is also completely tied with minorities, the Mexicans are taking our jerbs, the Blacks are taking our money and living off welfare, the Muslims are ruining our way of life and bringing more dumb workers to take our jobs thanks to the refugee crisis, oh and the Democrats are sending our jobs overseas so the wealthy elites can profit.  Right wing politics, makes racism and economic anxiety, one in the same but, to be fair to Trump voters, the Democrats have completely abandoned workers in favor of compromise, it's easy to see why a rational non racist person would vote for more Reaganomics when liberal incrementalism has brought nothing but more pain.
Minor disagreement: I wouldn't say that capitalism creates more wealth than any other economic system, unless you measure wealth by how many useless but shiny minerals you can extract from the ground.
The "is all fault of the political correctness" is my favorite theory.  Either enough white people thought to themselves "I am so tired of been called racist or misogynistic for thing that I don¬¥t personally have a problem with! I will vote for a REAL misogynistic and racist ass as the most powerful person in the entire US, that will show them!", wich is just great, or white people just WISHED that was the only reason and not the fact they are just racist and misogynistic assholes.  In any case white people just make themselves look terrible and I am in awe as a white hispanic that doesn¬¥t even live in the EEUU.
My only criticism is your point on rioting: eventually the ruling class is going to have to fear the working class if it's going to wane in power. Now, if we were to refrain from rioting in order to consolidate more support for the left, including from working class white people, fair enough, but if anythings gonna change in the long run, we're going to have to be more militant.
i don't have anything substantive to contribute or whatever but this was a fucking great video and i'm really glad i found this channel.
I don't really think anyone who understood Atlas Shrugged could legitimately equate the success of (Rand's) American Dream with the achievement of conventional standards of wealth and power. Pretty much the whole basis of Objectivism rests on the idea that the establishment is corrupt to the core by only allowing wealth and power to those who make slaves out of others, and that 'actual' wealth and power can only be found in resisting cronies in favor of black market trade and intellectual 'striking' against their methods of control. So if anything, a person like Trump being in office should convince people that the American Dream isn't attainable through the standard means of lying down in front of anyone willing to pay to kick you. It is found in that same anti-establishment sentiment which Contra suggests will result.  Also, what the heck do people think the rich do with their money? I mean, they use it to prop up the auto industry, service industry and mining industry with the purchase of useless consumer goods. 'The American Dream' always pictures rich people surrounded by mountains of crap they paid money to poorer people to obtain. That money that isn't theirs anymore. And even if for some reason their money is kept in a bank, that money is invested by the bank in businesses and loans which go to - poorer people, who need investments and loans. That's one of the main issues with pointing to the obnoxiously rich as the sole '1%' causing the problem. The fact is the money possessed by the '1%' is distributed among a much larger portion of the population whose sole labor is to cater to the needs of those rich and idiotic enough to lust after useless consumer crap.
HELL YEAH!! Hail Satan!
I always appreciate how exhaustive you are. We may come at this from slightly different angles but you made a lot of great points.
I still think we should empathize with the white working class that voted for Trump--that doesn't mean holding them above or not empathizing with the minorities they have now royally fucked over. As luke skywalker or jesus or something said, "Forgive them, for they know not what they do"   Understanding the systems of privilege in the US is in the best interest of people who believe they are being held down by the system and oppressed in poverty. They don't know any of this shit and there are lots of people like Trump who want every oppressed group to be in-fighting when they should be making allies. We can sit around and argue all day about the shoulds and how these people SHOULD do research, but if they earnestly knew how to research anything they wouldn't have voted for Trump.  We need to find ways of engaging with people who hold bigoted views that will not scare them off. It's maybe not fair that we need to go out of our way to politely put up with their nonsense but it's probably more effective than calling them every term we can think of and attacking them.  I'm tired of "shoulds" I just want solutions. All of these Trump supporters, racist or not are not irredeemable people. If we truly believe we are correct, we have a responsibility to ourselves and all of the groups who are in danger to eat a little shit and patiently convince these people through painful, but respectful dialogue to see things our way.   Just think how many sexist, homophobic, bigoted, racist people quietly changed their views and are now vocal leftists. I know there are lots because just look at all the attitude changes over the last 50 years on all of these issues.
Down with Trump. Hail Satan!
it was probably quite a small percentage of the electorate that voted for Trump whilst also advocating his repulsive nature.  It seems that a good % of those who did vote for him were simply believing what he said about flushing out the corruption in Washington and about bringing jobs back to America. The rust belt has been left behind and they just know that something had to change.. Clinton was not offering change, in fact it became more and more clear that she was even worse than what has been happening.  I mean nearly HALF the electorate weren't even motivated enough to go out and vote. the failing is of the democrats.   As vile as Trump is, the fact is a massive % of the population did not have faith in Clinton.  Sanders would have walked it.  The Dems practically stole the nomination from him.   Of course the Podesta emails made a big impact too, despite the MSM doing its best to avoid substantive analysis of what they actually revealed, instead preferring to drill the accusation of Russian hackers being behind them.  Clinton, funded by the same peope who fund ISIS, Clinton, controlled by Wall Street, Clinton the blood thirsty ("we came, we saw, he died! bwwahahaah!") warmonger was a million miles away from what a whole lot of progressives wanted.. despite her having a vagina.. there was nothing progressive about her.    Trump, the billionaire tax-dodger, the sexist, racist, walking bucket of puke managed to convince more people to back him.. with the help of the Clinton camp itself.. they fluffed him as a candidate from he start, believing he would be easier to beat. His victory is an indictment of the democrats failure and how far they slid away from left-wing, progressive ideals.    Hopefully this will be a wake up call.   Hopefully he won't be able to enact some of his predicted plans and hopefully now the world can start to deal with what has happened to America, instead of pretending its all OK.   Trump did not deserve to win, but Clinton definitely also did not deserve to win, this is at least a chance for some real change.   Would you rather deal with a wolf, or a wolf in sheeps clothing?   At least with the wolf, the villagers know its time to pick up the pitch forks before its too late. well, thats one way to try and get a silver lining out of this shit storm anyway..  fantastic video btw.   also, socialism FTW. natch.
Hail Satan!
Bernie failed because he was beaten into submission by neoliberals
And the wealthy elites continue to exploit everyone whilst watching their reality T.V. show called "Insert country here"  xx   Awesome vid too x
LOL Ayn Rand ideology is not going to appeal to these people? Yet most of the people on food stamps are Gary Johnson supporters and tea party members who watch Stefan Molayneu on YT. Just shows you the power of right wing brainwashing
Mmm~ These liberal tears are just keeping me alive~ How does it feel knowing we won't be going to war that Hilary wanted (War with Russia) It feels great~ And this is coming from a Chinese/amercian Women!
Going forward, while I wouldn't tell people not to bother voting, I think this election has well and truly destroyed the idea on the left that transformative change can be achieved via electoral means.  We should now turn to what social anarchists have been recommending for decades: grassroots self-organisation, pressure politics, and direct action. And not just of the oppositional variety. I mean building directly-democratic alternatives, on the ground, to the institutions of state and capital.
Do you speak Italian? Your accent is not bad
Im real worried instead of people startig to hate  him for lying they just start blaming minoroties more and more and they become angrier becuase the blacks are stopping him from making america great again and it becomes nazi germany. okay the last part was a bit much but still.
As a degenerate myself it was difficult to vote Trump/Pence. I didn't mind Trump's language and boorish behavior because I always assumed that's just how people in those sorts of circles behaved when no one was looking and that's probably how Hillary acts too. The real reason I went with Trump was just to avoid an escalation of conflict with Russia. In a sense, that reason alone "trumps" everything else. Until I considered her a potential to start another cold war, I was fully prepared to vote for Harambe.
I feel pretty chill about the Trump thing but I'm not American. I think his victory will teach the Dems a valuable lesson. I think he won't have the power to do much of his crazy plans. It'll be ok.  Hey, these new antidepressants are actually working. Huh.
Welcome to the 80's and say goodbye to the Ukraine.
I'm really not a fan of the theory that people voted for Trump as a reaction to people called '-ists', look at the spike in hate crimes after Trump and Brexit: Proto-Facists are encouraged by the growth of Fascism and discouraged by an atmosphere of intolerance to their intolerance, and I can't understand why so many people are buying the narrative that it works the other way around. I'd also say yes to rioting, but hey I'm an Anarchist I'd have said yes to rioting whoever won.
This is the best channel on YouTube.
You know, at least all the bigots of the internet have managed to co-opt the drinking tears joke they declared as cringy so many times before when it was referring to male tears when aimed at them. Every cloud, you know?
i think He was voted by Blacks, woman, hispanics, LGBT, too, and You were fooled by Media into believing they would not. Proof that White man were Not all Voting for him are You and many other like you. Hillary had 4 Mio. Dead people vote for her and 3 Mio. illigal.. And a Lot of Money to spend on a Lot more voter fraud, like historical high voter fraud. Bad luck for her, that a Lot voter fraud was detected and prevented, and only happened in democratic Strongholds anyway. As a foreigner i will tell You your past presidents were known to betray the americans values at every Chance and half the world were afraid of the US, other half prepared to give US a Taste of some of the bombs, Hillary planned on throwing on the world. I like Muslims, but Saudi Arabia is a bit... Well known for child Traffic, woman opression, LGBT opression and so on. You Can say i don't Care, let them live by their customs, but they had their spy placed next to Clinton as top advisor. Saudi Arabia is so rasist they Even slaughter fellow Muslims for being Not Muslim enough. How Do they feel about the US? You are Even more a target. They were about to make use of Hillary to Fight russia and shia Muslims for them and they would have been the laughing third Party if the US would have been destoyed in the process. You were Lucky.. and me too.. with Clinton i would have bought concrete to built a Bunker. From deep within my heart i thank anyone Voting Trump. i have 3 children, they need school. a functioning soceity. i dont want them to live in a Post nuclear would because of your irrelevant Media brainwashed opinions.
yeah i did vote for hillary but that new pizzagate thing just got big and... you know it's that i really started to think that donald is actually a better human being than her
What's wrong with violent protest? I want to bash the fash! :'(
I'm looking forward to the new political correctness being "don't call people racist or sexist! That's mean and you don't know how hurtful those words are!"  If these people were as concerned about bigotry as they are with being associated with bigotry maybe the world wouldn't be as shitty as it is.
Yeah I've been doing dabs in a forest in Virginia to cope. Lord! Oh Lord!  This fucking sucks.
Grateful that you and Shaun & Jen have made meaningful sense of this. Hopefully one of the silver lining will be that some of these reactionaries can finally stop complaining that they're the minority. They're the "action-aries" now. Hopefully we can wake them from their absurd dark enlightenment. Thank you daddy Contra. I'll still be drinking though.
Completely oblivious. You keep on going with exactly the same rethoric that put him in the white house.   I am a mexican, and I do get the problema ilegal inmigrantes cause over there. Its understandable that the among the ilegals a higer percentage of criminals will end up there. Yet you keep insisting Trump is racist for pointing that fact, even i recognize. The insistance on blaming on racism every problem between diferent demogr√°fics its another of the problems of the PC culture you promote, and the cause you are here yet again, because you label "sexual asaut" there were he explicitly stated  consent.  You still believe its "anti-stablisment" what got Trump elected. On the contrary, i would say the "anti-stablisment" didnt recognize the values and goodness within the stablisment, which defended itself.
Great video Contra!
I really like your Capitalism theory. It kinda makes sense now I think about it.
Although I disagree with some of this, this guy is so articulate and make such a reasonable position.
What does Hillary represent? I'd rather take open bigotry than witch hunts.
Because when shit goes the way people can't tolerate, people turn to political dogmatism in explaining anything.
Where are the fucking aliens when you need them...
Wow. You're really good at this.
"DUMB WALL" is exactly it.
Great work as usual, you fabulous internet person. This is one of the best analyses of this gargantuan clusterfuck I've heard. Blaming Trump on a single issue/group is deceptive and self-serving, especially considering by how slim a margin he won in OH/WY/FL.   One point of disagreement, however... I'm not so sure that I share your optimism in regards to Trump losing support among his base. He _will_ fuck up, and soon - that much is inevitable. But he is also prone to deflecting, and blaming everyone one but himself for his problems (classic narcissistic trait, that); and his base - let's face it - is not exactly what we pinkos used to call "the reality-based community". (Remember that? Oh,  if I had known that I'd once yearn for the simpler times of the Dubya presidency...).
You stated that the American dream was invented as a means of warding off socialism. Why do you believe that?  You also state that the American dream is a fantasy, how come? Yeah, it's far from perfect, but American is still a decent meritocracy - perhaps the best in the world. Surely it must be somewhat true when you consider some of the biggest companies in the world, Facebook, Google, Apple, MS, etc, have only been around for a few decades (at most) and were all started by some pretty average dudes who worked hard.  You also state that blacks don't believe in the American dream, but whites do. Why do you believe there is a difference here? Is there any evidence for this?  Also, suggesting that blacks don't believe in the American dream, and suggesting that instead of attempting to work hard and make something of themselves like whites they rather just fight for more welfare programs sounds a little racist. When you make claims or assumptions about a race, it's always good to explain why!
what do you expect trump to do to harm any racial/sexual minorities that validates their fear of him being elected?
Heavy drinking has been my main reaction.
mmm salt is my favorite mineral
Great video. I appreciate how even though you might lean left, you are still open and willing to understand why other people might have voted for Trump.  It might be why even as a bisexual conservative, i enjoy your videos. :)
A scary guy Trump is.  I hope we survive the next 4 years.  I not for getting rid of the electoral college.  The All Star wrestling clips are hard to watch.  New and old left makes sense.  Why aren't people more afraid of fascism?  This guy's moral character is not up to par.  Inverted totalitarianism.  Politics in the USA are very complicated.  What will Trump voters do when they find out he does not care??
I guess one thing that will change around Youtube is that all the skeptic pundits who claimed "the reason why I always criticize the left is because the left is in power" will now suddenly start doing videos about conservatives at the same rate they used to debunk "SJWs", right?  ...RIGHT?
all white people are racist all men are misogynistic
indeed #HailSatin
Good video. It blows my mind away how there can be dozens upon dozens of different explanations for this phenomenon of an election. It will be talked about for years probably more than many other elections in the US.
I know I've offered discussion on this topic before. But I think you should come on my channel to discuss these things. It would be fun.
i voted trump and i still liked this video even through i disagree with some of it. keep up the content contra
Holy crap the much anticipated Trump video!!!!
