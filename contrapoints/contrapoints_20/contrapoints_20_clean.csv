"Maybe before we answer the above question first we need to establish if the soul is real (and it's not. No serious. A thousand years from now people will still be debating theism but the jury is in on the idea of the soul. There's mountains of empirical evidence that sugest that we're simply our brains and nothing more. See: Matt Dillihunty and studies on split brain surgery). Unless she's simply using soul as a metaphor for mental health. In that case: I digress.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I feel like society conditions us to reject anything that's less than a romantic relationship on the grounds that being single is a personal failure. As a result, we appreciate casual sex and any romantic-adjacent connexion that isn't viable material for a traditional relationship a lot less than we should, because we dismiss those experiences as temporary distractions from the ultimate goal of finding a partner. Additionally, we tend to avoid having sex with friends under the assumption that repeated sex with someone we have a platonic attachment to might add pressure to turn the friendship into a romantic relationship. We conclude that sex ruins friendships, when in reality, the idea that if we have emotional and sexual chemistry with someone, material goals (kids, home ownership, etc.) are a necessary step in the relationship places tremendous pressure on friendships to not involve sex. As a result, we deny ourselves the opportunity to explore ourselves in various relational contexts, which makes us less likely to 'succeed' in the eventual romantic relationship that society tells us we should build by the time we turn 30.  The pervasive notion that marriage is the ultimate accomplishment in interpersonal relationships prevents us from envisioning relationships with nuance. It makes us worse friends, worse partners, and frames our expectations in a way that sets us up for disappointment and anxiety.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This I would definitely have to disagree because even though she does make good points on the some of the one way thinking of conservatives, there is a danger in claiming that all porn and all erotic interactions are liberating. Believe me, most people have viewed porn; and it's understandable, we are sexual beings and it's in our biology. However one time ,when I was in my teens and still viewing tons of porn, an add popped up right before the video and it was a man on top of a women, slapping her in the face over and over HARD. And there she was, smiling and screaming like a child with a new toy. After that I felt so sick to my stomach, I couldn't go through with watching the video I had wanted to originally.  Whether you argue that the women was fully consenting(which I can't imagine she was fully) this still is associating violence with pleasurable sex. And this was a pop up add. What do you think a 12 year old who is viewing porn for the first time is going to think about what sex is like? Also, while some good points were made, I felt she did not get into the darker side of casual sex. Consent is a vital aspect in any and all sexual encounters. Unfortunately though I've  heard a lot of stories where two people have just met and there having sex and everything is going fine until he asks if he can put it in her ass. She says no, but the bastard does it anyway. Now it's rape. And that poor girl has to deal with that her whole life. This is why I don't think the culture of consent and the romanticized hook up culture can ever fully coexist. After all, people try to imitate romantic scenes on TV were things are hot and sweaty then in a burst of heat both parties kiss and passionately remove one another's clothes, but there is almost never a clear cut question that the man asks her and she says yes. Directors know that if they did this, it would be a turn off. That's why these shows have given people a skewed vision of what good sex is, even though they are ignoring the essential question.  But going back to my other point on those scary situations. You don't truly know the people you met after 2 weeks. The relationship is already really superficial, and it's clear both parties are after sex, but what if one wants more than the other wants? This is the issue because some guys can be real pigs(that's not a generalization because I said some) and you can't fall back on always trusting someone u just met a week ago. This is why I think that the healthiest and best sex is intimate sex. You both have known each other for long time, you love one another, you want what is best for them. Not only is this great because it's intimate, but you both sincerely trust one another in these situations and care about the other person and their well being. Natalie even mentioned this when she was arguing the idea that it is solely for procreation. What she didn't understand was that the intimacy argument was something that the right uses a lot because the second most impersonal sex, is casual sex(the first being rape for obvious reasons).  Also, and I know I'm going to get some backlash for this, but there was a dark side to the Sexual Revolution that everyone forgets. This is best seen in the icon of Hugh Hefner, the founder of Playboy. Many I've met would say that Hefner is a feminist and that he improved the lives of women. But that is only what is on the surface of his personality. If you know about the psychology of sex and business you can see what Hefner was clearly trying to do. Hefner would be in all these pictures with the red robes, the dark sunglasses, the gold watch's, the fancy cars, the Mansion, and about ten unrealistically thin blond, white women all topless. Hefner did this because he knew that every man in their 20's wanted to be this. This high society 'bachelor' ideology is most effective on young boys. He was seen as having a good social status from the 'stuff' he surrounded himself with and that included women. This is the age old idea that having beautiful women around you as arm as eye candy is a sign of your wealth and social status. And what is so weird to me is how he is just so blatantly doing it, and no one is criticizing him for it.  So sometimes I have to wonder the full effect the sexual revolution brought to the table. Was it really as liberating for EVERYONE? Or was it just trading off one oppressive society(were women have to wear skirts down to their ankles and act all 'prim and proper' in order for acceptance) for another much different but still very oppressed society(where women have become expected to put out on the first date and meet a level of beauty that is neither healthy nor realistic in order to satisfy men and their fantasies.)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"That Laci Green appeals to naive 16 Year old girls as a statement that they're just kids, doesn't mean that it's more acceptable. If anything they defend against being mislead more poorly, due to decreased experience.  Repeated and consistent experiences of meaninglessness can cause people to lose hope. How many want to be special? What is the point of making an attempt if it is meaningless? 'It's just sex.' So that's it? It's just sex? How many orgasms did that produce?  One of the hardest things about promiscuous sex is this idea that you have to settle down. When are you going to commit? When do you get to have a sexual experience that feels more than a means to an end? When can you be truly open with someone?  Maybe a lot of intimacy issues have less to do with casual sex and more to do with how we perceive our sexual partners and how we are perceived. When sleeping with someone else I detest value statements that declare absolutes. 'This partner was just 'better'.' Like that even makes sense. What about the last partner I slept with? I don't need to degrade their position to feel better about myself.  And the thing is by this point people should know better. They already know about a misattribution bias. And if sex is a competition, the results are meaningless. Because they're rigged.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I think this form of self-annihilating transcendence  is a possible experience but that such experience is impossible to articulate.

"Hey contra, I disagree with you on something! You should look into the research on nofap (if you haven't already by now, I know this vid is almost a year and a half old). I dunno about TGO and his 'preserving sexual energy' or whatever, but more and more hard science is coming out about the addictive dangers of internet pornography. Tbh, I have experienced this first hand as I jerked off multiple times a day for 14 years or so starting at the age of 12. It's all about novelty, you see. When you have sex with the same partner, there is a diminishing returns effect on how often and how powerfully you feel a desire to have sex with that person. Conversely, throwing a new partner into the mix can hit an instant reset button on someone's horniness, basically. So, here we are with internet porn and we are able to see more humans erotically displaying themselves in 20 minutes than our ancestors would have seen other humans in general during their lifetimes.  What this (along with other factors) adds up to is a novelty machine that allows someone to come back over and over for that fix. Now, I'm not gonna suggest that everyone should stop pleasuring themselves forever or anything, but I will say that for people like me and many others, this is a BIG problem. It leads to low energy, low focus, low motivation, even impotence, and all these things lead to depression and anxiety. Nofap is something we HAVE to do, because like an alcoholic or drug addict that cannot help themselves, going back just once can send you spiraling down that path again.   There's no moral guilt here. It's not saying 'oh jerking off is bad and evil'. For most of the nofap community, it's 'I have a serious problem with this and I need to fix it.' I have a lot more to say but that's all ill say about that right now","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hmm I feel like I wanted you to say more on the title. You describe different sexual lifestyles as fine because they all have emotional risks, but are the risks equal? Is the consequential harm of heartbreak equal to that of loneliness? These emotions are just part of the story, obviously, and it may be impossible to ever measure in any reliable way, but I think the idea that casual sex is bad persists because it's good to take sex seriously. You acknowledge how serious pregnancy is and rape and I would throw in STDs, and for me that's enough to not want to numb myself to sexual relations, but the 'soul' or 'spirituality' involved in sex could be equally serious, as serious as a Jimi Hendrix solo at least. Would you want to consider a Jimi Hendrix solo as just any other casual experience? What else would you be numb to after that? I guess I'm saying that numbness worries me the most about casual sex, and not just for me. If there is an inherent seriousness to sex, then wouldn't it be I'll advised to repeatedly engage in something serious until it's casual?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This video was very interesting to watch, while you're making a video responding to a catholic YouTuber about casual sex, you do not completely oppose him.  It seems a lot of your sentiment is the same and it appears as if your ears may not be completely deaf to god, as your values seem to line up with Christian values pretty well (ps I am a Christian, NOT a catholic so i dont agree with the guy you're devating with fully).  I would recommend giving some Christian reading a try since you seem willing to consider new ideas as shown through your shift from a shitlord to a feminist and your willingness to read what this guy said.  It could help with the general despair and meaninglessness you feel and could show you a way to transcend past human consciousness.  I know it helped me a lot with my despair and nihilistic worldview and really strengthened by liberal values i held before I became Christian (I was an atheist/agnostic until I was 15).  Idk if you'll read this but i relate a lot with you and love your videos and if you'd just give it a try I think you might find something in it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

(There were some really weird typo corrections while I made this post, like changing the word 'One' to 'whole.' wtf?) -#2: We as a species need to figure out how to mandate reproduction.

I don't know how this needs to be implemented, but it does NEED to be implemented.  I'm sterile. My girlfriend is also sterile. We made these decisions because we're responsible 'adults.'

"It's interesting that you describe lust in part as the desire to 'possess' another human being. I've been thinking about this lately but don't have enough cis straight men in my life to be able to get their opinions: It seems to me that when I, as a person who is not-a-man, lust for a woman, I think about how attracted I am to her and how much I would like to give her pleasure. I see the narrative with cis straight men often seem to be, they think about how attracted they are to the woman, and how much they would like her to give them pleasure, in other words they desire to take or receive something from her, or in your words 'posses'. Do you think it's important to distinguish between these two different types of lust, 'I would like to give' and 'I would like to take' ?

"I think your my favorite person on youtube, the cultural references, eloquence and your overall eccentric aesthetic and personality are intriguing . Anyway I would argue that our propensity towards lustful objectification of other people is simply an instinctive animalistic impulse to mate. I believe we must recognize our base nature and impulses if we wish to fulfill our innate curiosity as much as develop holistically as human beings, as long as the attraction is reciprocal and the sex is consensual, this sort of indulgence can be interesting its as much a part of exploring our human condition as is seeking a fulfilling long term relationship. Maybe its just my epicurean propensities, its arguably unnatural to repress ones sexuality in the name of a gilt based, ethereal and historically inconsistent belief system. What do you think?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"This touches on something interesting. Religious people are still OBSESSED with sex as something 'dirty' instead of something transcendent--the fixation on procreation speaks to a desire to justify the base urges that most people are subject to (including themselves). It's easier to scream about babies than to understand it as transcendent, which would require more active sexual engagement (something many, say, priests and religious folk are not permitted/taught is wrong).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Contrapoints, I don't think that people long for transcendence when they lust.  I also don't think lust is bad, unless someone is referring to an extreme version of it.  We're animals and we're, at least on one level, gene survival machines.  We're genetically programmed to seek sex.  There's nothing wrong with that.  As long as people are responsible, honest, considerate, not obsessive (in a way that hinders their own functioning or that of others)and they're respectful of each other, I don't see anything wrong with casual sex.  If you personally take issue with lust, that's fine, but I think that's a subjective opinion that doesn't reflect something universal about lust (again, depending on the use of the word).  Sexually longing for someone doesn't mean that one has bad intentions.  It depends on what one wants to do.  Fantasizing in a way that isn't obsessive is normal and healthy.  Also, we can enjoy sex with people without 'objectifying' them.  Sex doesn't have to be sacred or dirty.

"Emotional damage is exactly why you should have casual sex, it's how you discover those emotions and learn to deal with them.

"I'm a dirty (hipster) Muslim who was raised in a Catholic country so I'm coming from a different perspective but actually have most of the same conclusions, which I find very interesting.  Most contemporary Muslim clerics, as well as most conservative Christians would tend to view the idea of sex outside of marriage, or even sex not for procreation(which is to be fair more of a yt Christian thing than a Muslim thing) and obviously having a more socially & religiously liberal perspective I wouldn't subscribe to this. I'm more focused on Islam and the concept of Zina and Nikkah so I'll focus on that right now.  The concept of Zina is generally taken to refer to adultery, and extra marital affairs. It's often used to defend segregation as you are not meant to even 'Come close' to Zina(whatever that means). Zina, in of itself, is a word of not-entirely clear etymology and it may not even be certain it has something to do with sexual relations, but may refer to some other form of dishonesty that happens to include cheating. Contrary to this, you have the idea of the Nikkah, a marriage contract. What's important to note is that ideally marriages can be made and broken off more easily than the modern western or 'Christian' concept of marriage. Divorce isn't a big deal. Islam traditionally afforded a lot of rights to women, this being one of them, before The Mens decided to ruin things as usual.   So, it's not actually completely terrible that traditional Muslims don't 'date' because marriage is easier to initiate and cease. But it's important too to ask why these things exist. Many of the rulings in the Quran with regards the status of men & women assumed an already unequal society where men were the primary breadwinners(despite Islam itself having many examples of strong and successful women, like Khadijah, Umm Ammarah). Personally I do see religious texts as more guidance than the basis of law(There's no compulsion in religion) anyway, so I'd be more inclined to relegate such an interpretation as a historical thing we can understand and learn something from, but particularly in this case there's a context for it.  And this is where my views sort of strongly align with what's being said here. Around the time of the Prophet(and frankly throughout much of history up until now) there was an awful lot of issue with men pursuing women in less than responsible ways, disrespecting them, sleeping around in perhaps the bad way. For one, it made it very hard to ascertain lineage, which is one of the reasons early Muslims figured out some basic rules. But there's another factor her, obviously, and it's the idea of a healthy relationship, and sexual encounters which are not only consensual but wholesome for both parties. So the idea of some sort of contract, was integral to early Muslim society, and continues to be to this day.  The thing about the idea of this contract is that initially it wasn't necessarily a formal marriage document, but a sort of verbal agreement - more resembling a *social contract* than the modern concept of a marriage. So - according to more liberal and likely more accurate interpretations of Islam - if you are engaging in relations with someone, you cannot do so irresponsibly. Even if you are 'sleeping around', there must be some form of mutual understanding. Every time you engage in relations with someone, and you communicate, and are aware of consent - a contract exists.   In my view, Islam emphasises the importance of this contract, and 'Zina' in fact refers not to 'extra-marital relationships' but exactly the sort of unhealthy dynamics you describe which particularly back then were creating real difficulties for society, especially women. The 'ruling' that clerics use to justify mandatory Hijab is similar(and there's a really good Ted talk about this online), it was referring to a particular case were men would hide in bushes and prey on lower class & slave women, who would not traditionally wear a veil or conceal their bosom. In doing so, they made their status more ambiguous, and thus men would be less likely to touch them, fearing the consequences. All the historical evidence seems to be point to the idea that these parts of the Quran(though I can't qualify as much for the Bible) were in response to leery and exploitative/irresponsible behaviour, rather than mere pleasure seeking.  Similarly, men and women(but especially men) are told to 'lower their gaze', to avoid that sort of leeriness discussed. I do find the idea of positive and negative hedonist pretty fascinating, and again believe this to be a dynamic which does appear throughout Islamic history -  Ali ibn Nasr al-Katib's 'Encyclopedia of Pleasure' for example, which among other things tells of a romantic relationship between a Muslim woman and a Christian Princess. While we're on this subject too - there's a tale within the 1001 Nights which contains an erotic depiction of two women having relations! Containing erotic descriptions of both heterosexual and homosexual love would be unheard of in modern Islam. Yet in a story derived from Middle Eastern Folklore, taken from Muslim societies at the time, we find 'The story of King Shahriman and his son, Qamar a-Zaman'.  I think that a lot of people especially in the Muslim world take issue with the idea of empty, hedonistic relationships and I think on certain levels I do too, but on principle. More liberal Muslims interpret Alcohol the same way - technically it's not absolutely forbidden, but it's said that it coincides with unruliness more often than not, and can be a 'temptation of the Devil' - which if you think about how alcohol affects a lot of people, is hard to deny. I think that the interpretation of Abrahamic religions(especially Christianity and especially moreso Islam) as no-fun-allowed and disalllowing of the pursuit of pleasure contradicts much of the rest of what their texts contain(like in Quran, it being stated that Allah has sent down everything on earth for us to consume) isn't really in keeping with their original intent, or these religions as best practised.   I think instead they're trying to teach people to be responsible and be mindful of the effect their decisions have on themselves and others. Which is a conclusion I came to even before I got into Islam.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Insightful video. I want to add my voice to the conversation as a politically progressive Christian (Yes we exist ). Personally, I'm not a fan of casual sex but I'm still sex positive in a sense. Its pretty clear sex is a gift from God for humans to enjoy. Hell, there's an entire book in the Old Testament all about how awesome sex is. However, this doesn't mean all sex is good. Divine gifts can be abused and to be honest, that is the source of most sin. I'm actually more lenient than some Christians regarding this issue. I don't think pre-marital sex is always bad but I think sex should be confined to couples in serious relationships. A theologically accurate view of sex involves acknowledging it as a powerful act of communion and reducing to pure hedonism cheapens it.  At the same time, I think its silly to try to make Non-Christians act like Christians. Trying to coerce people into being Christians will only breed resentment which is one of the reasons I reject social conservatism. Therefore, I don't really care if secular people are into casual sex and I have very little tolerance for slut shaming. I only have two demands from people who like casual sex.  1. Make your intentions perfectly clear with your partner. Manipulating people for your own pleasure isn't cool. 2. Don't look down on people who willing choose a more conservative form of sexual expression.

"Plato doesn't say anything in the Symposium, but more seriously I swear Socrates argues that the center of love is a longing to recreate the object of beauty through reproduction. The other characters are more pederastic, obviously--that one younger guy defends the honor and masculinity of being loved by older men, the older lover defends older lovers as non-exploitative, and Aristophanes for sure is all like 'love of boys is purer and more classy,' but Socrates treats them all with the same contempt and sarcasm that he treats everyone with in all the dialogues. Alcibiades even shows up to bitch about how Socrates is sexless because he never went for anything after tutoring sessions and it made him feel ugly. Same in the Phaedrus, right? Phaedrus pretends to give some long speech he heard about how you shouldn't have sex with people who love you because love is obsessive and possessive, which in effect is Phaedrus saying 'hey, you keep not desiring me or fucking me, is it because you think I'm into you? Or you're not in love with me? I'd still be cool with a FWB thing.' And Socrates mocks him mercilessly. Plato seems at times to think Socrates is a little too silly, like in the end of symposium, but since Socrates is almost Philosophy Jesus for plasto, it's hard to read these works as pro-pederasty. The pederasts are another crowd for Socrates to troll.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

A friend of mine, who was raised some brand of Protestant, told me that the first time he ever kissed a guy, his immediate thought was of hell; that seems to me a sort of spiritual terrorism, like the fire 'n brimstone speech of the priest in Part 3 of Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.

"I found the comment that 'sex being ethical is about more than consent' intriguing, though I'm not sure if you [Contra] chose the best examples of other ethical questions to pose - I mean, information is a prerequisite to consent (which is why the only viable form of it is considered 'informed' consent), so anything which impedes information or the way in which it is processed is still bound to the issue of consent, not something external to it. But it may be more true to say that consent is the only basis for sexual 'politics' as something distinct to 'ethics'. I make a distinction between the two [correctly or otherwise] as politics being the action of moderating other individuals and ethics purely in the action of moderating the self.  As far as sexual ethics are concerned, that means literally any sexual act you do not consent to is one you find ethically questionable [rephrased: morally questionable for YOU personally]. I don't think that's particularly unhealthy. I'm okay with all the weird people out in the world who think heterosexuality is gross and incest is evil - what I'm not okay with is the attempt to politically influence or control another person's decisions based on one's own personal ethics. And that's what conservatives are guilty of, whether they are the 20th Century conservatives hanging around The Right or 21st Century conservatives who haven't yet departed from The Left.  The thing with religion coming in is that it defers ethics in favor of politics. The ONLY rationale brought in and perhaps necessary to religion is that someone else knows more and better and should be making those choices, and the attempt to understand those choices through scripture is pretty much irrelevant until you've pulled a Lucifer and claim equality to God. So yeah, for a lot of people casual sex is bad for the soul. But for an even higher proportion of mystics, complete submission to the great dominatrix they call God is the only ethos they ascribe to.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Justicar responded to your first video, and Armoured Skeptic responded to your second one.  I don't care about this too much but It makes the line lose some of its rhetorical punch. 3) Overall I really enjoy this style of dialogue on YouTube.  It's clear that you don't hate 'The Distributist' or go for cheap shots of showing his whole video in 10 second clips and doing angry rebuttal rants.  You try to summarize his argument as fairly as you can and then offer points of agreement and disagreement.  Sort of like the goal here is to actually move opinions forward instead of just argue controversial topics for the sake of YouTube money! 4) I'm now on a rabbit hole checking out The Distributist and I'd love to spend the afternoon watching and forming a bunch of thoughts on the arguments themselves but I have a busy day ahead of me so I'd better not do that, I'll come back to comment more fully at some other time.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Yes, no matter what you do, you have to take emotional risks.   It's also a good idea to take emotional responsibility. Whatever sort of pain is associated with one's lifestyle of choice does need to be dealt with, and not blamed on others or even on the lifestyle itself. In a free society, we make our choices and then must accept the outcome of those choices. If the outcome brings more pain than nourishment, we can change the lifestyle choice, or we can attempt to become better at living that lifestyle. Those are the only two responsible reactions, the only responses that can improve the quality of our lives.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Need a full version of Earth Angel on iTunes right now. Like, RIGHT now. Also, just a side note, isn't it funny how some people believe Adam and Eve is literally true? Like if Adam was made first, THEN the Eve, then why the hell would Adam have nipples? Y'all know that shit exists because nipples are formed before fully determined sex in the womb, but NO. Maybe God just really REALLY liked the idea of sensitive chest lumps... I mean I'm not saying anything, I'm just saying...","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Trying a lot of new stuff here, let me know what you think!  I've discussed the possibility of doing a live stream with the Distributist to talk about these issues, so I'll tweet/FB about it if that happens.  One thing that bothers me slightly about this video is that it kind of comes across like I have this disdain for procreation, which I do not, in fact, have, though I think it would be pretty irresponsible for me, personally, to procreate. At this point.  Also, I'm so sorry I've been procrastinating on the captions. I will literally do this video and as many others as I can today.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
