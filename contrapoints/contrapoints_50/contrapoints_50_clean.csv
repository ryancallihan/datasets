"Just a friendly reminder that you can lessen the environmental impact of your diet without committing to absolute veganism. You can have meatless mondays or you could eat meatless at home but when you go out treat yourself to a burger. A lot of the times I think people feel overwhelmed by the suggestion of totally give up meat to create a positive impact but you don't have to. You can still eat meat, just reduce how much you do","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Nick's (who goes by 'Natalie' now) power hunger and manipulation know no bounds. Society should (nee must) view men who claim such as a women; society should (nee must) ascribe to his or Al Gore's assessment of the environmental situation.   Wake up. All current environmental problems are the result of capitalism; i.e., humans' automation of production in pursuit of efficiencies and profits during and after the industrial revolution. That was the cause of all modern conveniences, including vehicles, factories and everything digital. That revolution also led to the vastest gains for humans in terms of health, life expectancy and standard of living ever known. The solution to externalities will be found through the same means. Stop your power hungry alarmism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"For those who are allergic to a lot of vegetables like I am.  You don't necessarily have to go vegan, hunting is a good way to get a source of red meat without hurting the environment. White tail deer populations are at an all time high so you would actually be doing the world a favor by thinning out the herd.  It's an environmentally friendly way because the money you buy for deer tags is 100% given to the department of interior and you're depriving the industrial farming market out of hundreds dollars of profit every year.

"i mostly agree with the topics execpt veganism... there IS actually a scientific truth behind why you should eat meat. And its population control over livestock... its basic ecosystem upkeeping. I know its a 'human' generated system as cows would obviously not mass produce in the speed they do, but currently due to human intervention there is just overpopulation...if you would let all the livestock go they would harm our generic ecosystem as it is. Its like when there was a japaneese city that competly eliminated a type of bird to be killed - then the bugs got overpopulated and ate all the farmers green stock :D so humans almsot starved to death... ecosystem is a bitch and once humans fuk it up its very hard to recover it without consequences. Altough I agree that if someone is a vegan I personally have nothing to do with it. But I fail to see actually what are the benefits of being a vegan besides being thin and being able to claim that I am 'vegan'... to me it adds no value to the way of my living. I can live healthy with or without being vegan so its just something humans make up. But the truth to be told ecosystems are not to be fuked. W e really were designed to be predators for a reason... we - even though we fight a lot not to - should be fitting into this ecosystem... but being vegan is not the way. Being restrictive and not abusing the system is... but no one preaches that... cause that would actually rob money out of economics :3","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I know it was said sarcastically by your 'mother nature' character, but I'm really sick of hearing this 'Climate change might kill humans but _the Earth_ is going to be fine' argument.  Like yeah, the actual ball of rock that comprises most of Earths mass? That's going to be fine. That's not really the important part though. It's the thin film of life that's spread across the surface of this ball of rock that should be the focus here, and if you think that somehow this 4-billion-years-in-the-making cosmic chemical miracle is magically immune from utter destruction, you're kidding yourself. There's no pre-destined plan here. This isn't a dress rehearsal. What's to say we can't kick off some positive feedback loop that turns Earth into Venus?

"I would like to note something said in this video that isn't necessarily true. Driving a hybrid or electric car will not help with carbon emissions just because those cars don't produce emissions. The electricity running those cars most likely came from a power plant burning coal or some other fossil fuel. Since nothing is 100% efficient, excess carbon emissions are produced when you get your electricity from a power company that is then transported (which also wastes energy) to you. The point is, your carbon footprint driving a hybrid or electric car is actually larger than if you were to drive a regular car. Before electric cars can truly become green, we need to produce electricity in a clean way.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"No chance anyone's going to read this at this point, but the 100 companies thing is kind of deceptive. That 100 companies represented the 71% of all INDUSTRIAL emissions, which was left undefined, by did not include agriculture. In fact it seemed purely to be composed of energy companies. And well those doobies need to do much much better and stop trying to cover their asses legislatively, we need to recognize that they are us. China coal (the largest producer of those companies), provides electricity to people in China by burning coal. The less energy Chinese people use, the less they will emit. Same goes for all the other companies listed. Too much coal or natural gas? We're to blame. Too much oil? We're to blame. We can't ask for shit and then get mad at companies for providing it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"In one of the sited papers, it states that 97% of scientist agree with the statement, 'Human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperature.'  Don't think many would argue against this position.  However, the statement reads, 'significant contributing factor', not the absolute cause of anthropogenic global  warming (AGW).  I believe that the AGW stance has been over sold, and in doing so allowed some to question the whole idea of AGW.  The IPCC has been found falsifying data to support the idea AGW.

"I am not a denier by any means. However, unfortunately things are a little bit bigger than just science or just politics. In my opinion, I believe that perhaps both sides of this issue or in similar situations. I think that people who believe in the future catastrophes from climate change might be taking it a little too extreme, but I also believe that people who think it doesn't exist don't take it seriously enough. It is funny the hypocritical nature of using science to invalidate transgender individuals but at the same time not use it to validate the reality of climate change.   All of that being said, the reason that there is such an intense debate about this is because it is hard to know what is the truth. Conservatives aren't stupid. Liberals aren't stupid. We are just unfortunately tied up in misinformation and out right dishonesty, all of which are used to progress certain agendas. Climate change isn't going to be solved by just voting Democrat. I honestly don't think it's going to be solved at all.   Humans are too preoccupied with themselves and what they want and what the political environment is to really truly care. We are self-destructive. I believe that it will get to the point where humankind is at risk for extinction due to Climate change before anyone takes any kind of genuine action. Most actions right now by the people who can enact this type of change are politically motivated and don't have genuine support. And all of that aside, this requires the cooperation of the entire World. That means China would have to stop what they're doing with their industrial ambitions. That means India has to progress drastically faster than they currently are. Look at the Middle East, they regressed in 50 years faster than they progressed to where they were in the 70s. I of course am referencing areas like Iran and Iraq, and not the entirety of the Middle East.  Look at where America is now. We spent a long time trying to research renewable resources only to come up with virtually nothing, and coming up with technology that is actually worse for the environment. I will of course do everything that I can to support the environment of the planet because I do respect the earth and nature. However, it is naive to believe that we are going to be able to make these changes that we drastically need to make while still being practical with the reality of the current time in order to prevent the catastrophic results that may result from continuing to behave the way that we are in regard to the climate. It's like expecting world hunger to be solved. It's never going to be solved. There always be groups of people who benefit from the starvation of massive amounts of people and thus True change can never really occur. This is also because people have the wrong idea about how to solve these issues. We just simply do not have the capacity or tools to prevent what will be the inevitable. As much as we don't want that to happen.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'We're so self-important. Everybody's  going to save something now. 'Save the trees, save the bees, save the  whales, save those snails.' And the greatest arrogance of all: save the  planet. Save the planet, we don't even know how to take care of  ourselves yet. I'm tired of this shit. I'm tired of f-ing Earth Day. I'm  tired of these self-righteous environmentalists, these white, bourgeois  liberals who think the only thing wrong with this country is that there  aren't enough bicycle paths. People trying to make the world safe for  Volvos. Besides, environmentalists don't give a shit about the planet.  Not in the abstract they don't. You know what they're interested in? A  clean place to live. Their own habitat. They're worried that some day in  the future they might be personally inconvenienced. Narrow,  unenlightened self-interest doesn't impress me.   The planet has been through a lot worse than us. Been through  earthquakes, volcanoes, plate tectonics, continental drift, solar  flares, sun spots, magnetic storms, the magnetic reversal of the poles ...  hundreds of thousands of years of bombardment by comets and asteroids  and meteors, worldwide floods, tidal waves, worldwide fires, erosion,  cosmic rays, recurring ice ages ... And we think some plastic bags and  some aluminum cans are going to make a difference? The planet isn't  going anywhere. WE are!  We're going away. Pack your shit, folks. We're going away. And we  won't leave much of a trace, either. Maybe a little Styrofoam ... The  planet'll be here and we'll be long gone. Just another failed mutation.  Just another closed-end biological mistake. An evolutionary cul-de-sac.  The planet'll shake us off like a bad case of fleas.  The planet will be here for a long, long, LONG time after we're gone,  and it will heal itself, it will cleanse itself, 'cause that's what it  does. It's a self-correcting system. The air and the water will recover,  the earth will be renewed. And if it's true that plastic is not  degradable, well, the planet will simply incorporate plastic into a new  paradigm: the earth plus plastic. The earth doesn't share our prejudice  toward plastic. Plastic came out of the earth. The earth probably sees  plastic as just another one of its children. Could be the only reason  the earth allowed us to be spawned from it in the first place. It wanted  plastic for itself. Didn't know how to make it. Needed us. Could be the  answer to our age-old egocentric philosophical question, 'Why are we  here?'   Plastic... asshole.'  --George Carlin","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"to be fair, veganism and vegetarianism can't really fix climate change, worldwide-scale plant based diets aren't sustainable and even reclaiming and forming the utopia required for a plant based diet on a planet scale would still require further deforesting, the thing about cattle is that condenses a fuckton of food into a small package; a cow is (give or take) 300kg of food, and 300kg of vegetables occupy a lot of space, also cattle doesn't have one use; it can still be used for leather, milk (which i know isn't neccesary for post adolescent development but still I really like cheese and yogurth and you're gonna have to take it from my cold, dead hands). Recient developments have transformed the methane from dung into fuel making cows and pigs (the most notable methane producers from our food supply alongside fucking rice) a source of energy. BUT consuming less meat is very good for the environment (and health, the medical recomendation for meat is a piece the size of your hand 3 times per week or beef and the 4 remaining days fish or chicken, which very few people follow), it would bring a balance to our food production by requiring less farm spaces, and could reclaim a part of the food supply used to feed cattle (80% IIRC) and use it for more sustainable, more green alternatives than soy; also it's good for our health, since (and this is an issue vegans love to ignore) B12 vitamin deficiency is a very real issue that takes place a lot of time after mantaining a vegan diet, and lifetime B12 supplements arent really nice (or having cereal for breakast your entire lifetime, which is awful) and it's such a late complication (and the only serious one) of veganism that by the time it sets on (the body contains a reserve for 15-20 years of B12 ) you don't really think the issue was caused by veganism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Science and climate denial seems to have a common thread. It seems to be about hating science's refutation of bilical timelines on the surface(evangelical voters claim science and atheists 'want to steal their faith'), but much deeper we find the petrol lobby. At the citizen level the religious twist matters most, but the politicians make it obvious they only use religion to recruit dolts. The politicians are just protecting them fat lobby checks while hoping they make enough money to set themselves up to survive the hell on earth theyve helped create, they all have SHTF delusions of grandeur.  A self fulfilling apocolypse fetish for the religious nutters. They will claim it proves their god exists. They hate themselves and humanity that much, mostly due to a lifetime of the self abusive beliefs.  This is why i call abrahamic religion 'the slave religions' since the scriptures are mostly excuses for bullying, sexual predation and using terror to enforce a culture of obeying cruel illogical tyrants then praying for an imaginary friend to 'fix' the suffering their obedience causes, usually via more suffering.

However, (yikes I'm being a however person), as someone who is a strong believer in capitalism, I have to disagree with the notion that capitalism is unsuited to fix this issue.  Only pure capitalism where the government does literally nothing to businesses will fail.  However, if the government would create incentives for companies to reduce carbon emissions (essentially carbon tax), and start mass funding businesses that will create a renewable energy alternative (with bettering electric/hybrid cars and growing renewable energy sources), we will have a better shot at lowering our effect on the climate.  Incentivize business practices that will make businesses want to change their ways, don't force it. The problem really is that so many politicians are corrupt idiots that won't do anything at all.  I wouldn't even say explicitly vote Democrat because a lot of older Democrats won't even do anything about it.

"It's called 'climate change' and not 'global warming' because as the Artic loses ice, Antartica gains ice. Why have 'scientists' only placed 8 thermometers in Antartica... where results were the opposite of what their models predicted... and almost 2,000 in the North? Shouldn't the South Pole be studied as much as the North Pole? Shouldn't we have more than 8 thermometers there? For all your talk about the right evading science... the left really hates talking about the South Pole. They also hate simple facts like 'avg temperature' is not the same as 'temperature'. Tell me how many thermometers we need & where they should be placed on Earth to give us the real 'temperature' of the planet. You can't. That's called science. Science is always far more what we don't know, than what we do know. 90% of the 'science' we believed 100 yrs ago it's all been proven wrong. 90% of the 'science' we believe today will be disproven 100 yrs from now. For all we know the magnetic fields control the climate more than greenhouse gases. And water is the principal greenhouse gas. NOT CO2. Another fact liberals hate. Water exists as a solid, liquid, gas. CO2 exists as solid and gas. CO2 can also be oxidized by ozone unlike H2O. So tell me liberals, after we remove all the CO2, or just a portion, and the temperature doesn't come down which it won't... will you start protesting water vapor? Why not? Why aren't you protesting water vapor right now? Because WATER is also the main byproduct of combustion, not CO2. There's always more hydrogen in fuels than carbon.

"Change... it's what the climate has always done.  Climate is not a static thing.  Remember the last Ice  Age?  Probably not, but I'd rather see global warming than global cooling.  The thing is, whether you believe that human activity has made a significant change in the climate or not, you're assuming that we can just 'change it back'.  We can't.  There are just too damned many of us, and we all need to eat, and stay within a temperature range conducive to life.  We all fart, and exhale carbon dioxide, and yet there is only 4/100's of 1% CO2 in our atmosphere.   Ironically, had it not been for fossil fuels, there would be far fewer humans walking the Earth today, and far less human impact on the planet, but such is evolution, and human evolution includes the development of a carbon-based economy upon which we depend for our very survival.  Try to imagine the social and economical impact of tearing apart the very fabric that sustains us and tenuously binds us together.  You mention climate refugees, yet nearly all refugees today are due to war or economic reasons.  Anything that significantly disrupts our modern economy is guaranteed to have people rioting in the streets.  It's already happening in France and other places.   The only thing that remains the same, is the fact that everything always changes... and we learn to adapt and evolve.  We do not and can not control our destiny on a global scale.  Nature has many self-regulating systems that come into play when things get too far out of balance... like human overpopulation has.  Nature will take its course in due time.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I genuinely wish I was paranoid and delusional enough to believe that U.S. Republicans were lizard people from another planet purposely causing global warming in order for them to survive and rebuild their orphaned race.  Because at least that would be an understandable reason based on need.  Rather than the entire reason our world is on the brink of disaster being... money. Not even money to do anything with, money for the sake of money. The richest people in the world rarely spend more then a fraction of a percent of their net worth yearly. What do they use the rest on? To make more money. To do what? Make more money.  Because to them, rather than life or death, peoples well being, the health of the planet we live on, and even basic moral fiber are meaningless against the game, the *sport*, of simply acquiring more wealth.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"tl;dr: 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions. They have a lot of money. They give money to politicians to protect themselves from government regulations. Politicians misdirect the public with conspiracy theories so we don't rise up and demand regulation. If you cause enough confusion people don't want to bother to think about the issue anymore, and decades go by while the problem gets worse and the business make $$$. If you don't believe in climate change, follow the money. Was the person telling you climate change is a lie given money to side with businesses? The funny thing is, there IS a conspiracy, it's just not the one the politician is telling you to believe in.   It's scary how easily we let companies manipulate us. They know they're hurting people, but as long as they make money they don't care. Look at fast fashion, look at sugar and processed foods, etc. They'd rather pay off politicians and fill consumers minds with conspiracy theories.

"Well, I come from a small european country, but here the majority reycles (at least a tiny bit), try to eat as much local as possible, there's a lot of people making effort, a lot of manifestations to have a cleaner energy, a nicer electrecity that comes forome water, winds and solar panels. Sure our electrecity is not 100% clean.. yet but there is a lot of changes. Stoping eating meat is not a solution, but reducing it, is a thing. Eating a chicken that comes from less than 100km instead of a fish or a lamb that comes form New Zeland or an avocado that comes from central america. (I'm from those that won't stop eating meat because if the entire planet went vegetarian it wouldn't change a thing, methane and carbon dioxyde are not the only thing that makes the temperature rise. A vegeterian planet is not a solution)  But all those efforts don't change a thing, the temperature is still rising faster and faster every day. Why?  Because the biggest countries don't take the responsability of it. The companies are responsible too. Principally USA and Brazil. China making actually a huge progress in ecology even if it's still not enough to compensate they're coal/charcoal industry, they are making progress. India being to poor to do anything. I'm not saying at any point that Europe hasn't a part of responsability in the climate change, I want to make that clear: Everyone has to do something!

"I really love your channel. It's basically the best out there. Haven't researched climate change myself, so thanks for the insight.   But why oh why on Gods earth does no one talk about the reason for our high emissions: work, jobs, labour, however you want to call it. The belief system that you have to work for a living to earn money to buy shit is the root cause of ALL of this.  Buy a Prius? Are you kidding me? Where does a Prius get its power from? Where are its parts produced and assembled? Do you have any idea how many people have to drive to work for a Prius to be built? And how many trucks are rolling day and night, hour for hour to get Prius parts from point A to point B? If everyone would drive a Toyota Prius, NOTHING would change. Earths temperature would still be rising, though admittetly slower than it would if everyone drove a V8 Escalade.   All the things we buy. The devices we use to communicate right now. All the fine clothes, beverages and makeup that you use to create this beautiful content: Delivered by trucks, trucks, trucks which means: emissions, emissions, emissions.  Don't get me wrong, I love the pleasures of western civilization and I'd like to keep all the good and shiny things I own. But in my humble opinion, we can't have it both ways.  We can't have smartphones, makeup, plenty of clothes, coffee, a Prius, fulltime jobs, enough money to buy enough shit and still stop 'The Apocalypse'.   I'm 37 years old and I have worked for 3 years of my life. The other time I spend mostly living off around 600EUR a month, I never owned a car, the last time I've been flying was over 20 years ago and I basically wear my clothes until they fall apart.  There were times in my life when I had money (earning >3kEUR a month) and you know what I did? I bought shit. Because, fuck it, what else should I do? Shit that was produced by people who drive to work by car (emissions!) to earn money to buy other shit that was produced by other people, also driving cars (emissions).....you get the point. It's this neverending circle of working, manufacturing, delivering, selling and buying shit shit shit.  Now I know I don't make a difference. And if I had money I'd spend it on pleasures. But I don't and I can't be bothered to work for a living to basically sell my life to buy shit.  What I can do though is ride my bike to go by the river to read books, play the guitar, all for free.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Gore is not 'right' cause he makes a ton of different claims which, claims based on speculation can't be lumped together with claims based on evidence.  -Climate change has been happening for many many years. And scientists have known about it for all this time. Its not new. -People that claim that releasing carbon into the atmosphere over many many decades doesn't actually change the greenhouse effect are as ignorant as people that claim that fairies are real and the earth is flat. No hate. Just sayin. PHYSICS, like thermodynamics, can't be argued with. But the actual effects of those physics on our way of life? That actually can be argued till the day the outcome happens.  -Al Gore is trying to get the public to change its ways all while getting MASSIVELY wealthy from the very thing he's supposedly fighting against. -Al Gore is a hypocrite when his houses and private jet travel FAR eclipse ANY carbon emissions from ANY individual from the 'lower classes.' Why can't he fly commercial? Even business class? Cause....well....EW! right?...rich people are assholes.... -We have NO idea what the REAL effect climate change will have over the next decades. We can make models. But factors unknown will come about. For example, what if additional rain makes plant life thrive opening new carbon sinks that would make our current models incorrect? what if new aquatic species form because of the salinity and ph changes which also become a stronger carbon sink than todays models predict? WE DON'T KNOW what will happen.   Anyway Natalie, great video as always. I wish I could side with liberals. I like liberals. They hate religion and I believe they honestly just want people to have good lives. I just can't. Liberals are wrong about so much. So are conservatives. But conservatives are correct about economics and that effects EVERYone. Keep your gay marriage, abortion, etc, and stop trying to change the capitalist economic system to a socialist/communist thing. That's all I want. The carbon tax thing will not end up a free trade thing if liberals have their way (visavie the 'new green deal'). Make it a free trade thing, like a market where carbon credits are traded openly and transparently, I'm fine with it like they did in Australia. But if liberals had their way, the government would simply tell the EPA to go close any company that is a 'polluter.' Keep the government out of business. They shouldn't be doing anything but making rules everyone can live with and enforcing  those rules. But climate change, at least right now, is an excuse to fuck people up, take yet MORE of our income, and that is not a good thing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Have you ever read 'A State Of Fear' by  Michael Crichton  (HarperCollins, 2004)? A year and a half later came Al Gore's 'An Inconvenient Truth' (2006). Both are fiction although Crichton makes no claim otherwise. He does, however, list some data that Gore would likely find inconvenient. Personally I think that mankind has little to do with the climate, and can do very little about it. More CO2 will contribute to more plant growth and if more trees were planted, more oxygen would result. No mention is made in IPCC regarding the role the Earth's orbit and axial tilt play in how much sunlight reaches the northern and southern hemispheres. It only notes that the amount of sunlight reaching Earth is constant. However due to the axial tilt, the light that reaches the northern (and southern) halves varies as the earth orbits the sun. And the orbital path varies in in the shape of the ellipse it describes, from more circular to lengthier. I find this argument more compelling than blaming CO2 as a greenhouse gas monster. Water vapor has the most significant greenhouse effect. Just FYI. Aside from that I really enjoy your videos.

"hello, i love your videos! I dunno if my comment will be seen by anyone but i just want to talk about something i'm very passionate about- which is the future of agriculture! i know you mentioned going vegan to reduce your carbon footprint on the planet, but did you know that animal agriculture- if done right- cannot only regenerate farmland killed off by intensive crop farming BUT can create carbon sinks to reduce carbon in the atmosphere URL rotational grazing of cattle on pastures will increase the fertility of the land, which in turn can be used for growing produce in a rotational manner. this not only maintains the health of land, but eliminates most use of pesticides and fertilizers (both of which contribute to the death of many native bee populations and run off into bodies of water). these are just snippets of the solutions ive learned in school- there are many agriculture solutions to this, and i believe they can be the first step into turning our global plight around. We will always need to feed our population- so why not first make sure we are doing so sustainably","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Reactions to veganism demonstrate what is perhaps the greatest disparity between the harmlessness of a practice and the anger it induces in others. You'd think vegans were eating aborted fetuses and not simply excluding one type of food from their diet, the way every vaguely-right-leaning shithead has it out for them.

"Came to a revelation while watching the video.  Why do we think that 'shareholders' of companies only care about short term gain and are not concerned with the long term affects of their recklessness and irresponsibility. Because there is a mentality that exists for, I would guess, a LOT of Americans that if you are rich, you can avoid being affected. That if you are rich, you can avoid the consequences of your actions.  And it's no wonder people have this mentality, we CONSTANTLY see rich people not held accountable for their actions or not being punished to near the same extent as less wealthy people who commit much smaller crimes. I honestly believe that changing this mentality by making sure that rich people are as accountable for their responsibility will go a long way to making people care more about long term consequences of short term actions.  Personally, and this may seem ridiculous to a lot of you, I see this disregard of consequences is in the video game industry. Shareholders of video game companies are more than likely not interested in the industry, so the short term profit that leads to the destruction of the industry in the long term is of no importance to them because they do not participate in the industry, they only make money off of it. By the same token, I think a lot of people don't think they participate in society, so they don't see societal problems as something they care about.  Idk, people like this really upset me but I don't know what to do about it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I think my favorite (read: worst) part of the average climate change denier's rhetoric is that scientists HAVE to publish reports backing up global climate change in order to keep getting funding, a position that they probably picked up from a piece of propaganda created and paid for by big oil companies who have by FAR more money involved than any climatologist. The mental gymnastics is astounding.

"My problem with climate change is that it seems really difficult to understand unless you study a ridiculus amount of papers and have a scientific background. I sometimes watch different points of view, but there's always a guy that has a counter argument. What I would like the most is to have a lot of debates about it between knowledgeable people, so I can see them better resolve the arguments. I've tried looking for debates but they are scarce, and the few there are, usually the person who fully supports the climate change stance is less articulated, and frankly has worse arguments.  Still, from what I've gathered, it seems that there is such a thing as climate change, and at least a portion of it is caused by humanity. How much climate change? not sure. How much a portion is caused by humanity? not sure.  And above all else, what the fuck do we do about it? When it comes to actual policies and measures, there are some reasonable arguments that what we have to do is A LOT, so much, that all treaties about it do essentially nothing even if followed. At least today, it seems we can't support anything close to a modern way of life without fosil fuels, that wouldn't cost a whole lot more with other energy sources.  I'm all for trying to solve problems, but suggesting stuff that doesn't do anything just because we want to feel good about ourselves doesn't seem a good plan to me. There's probably a lot of things we can do, that collectively contribute almost nothing. I want to know what are the things we can do that do make a difference, that can actually reduce or stop the problem in a significant amount.  I heard an economist say that the best we can do for climate change is invest in research for alternative energy sources, so they can become viable mainstream. Most other things seemed to do so little or have such negative side effects they are unrealistic.  By the way, I'd love to see a debate between the main exponents of each side, if anyone has a link.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'd like every self-righteous vegan in the comments to read this article from Contrapoints' own approved source, Skeptical Science:  URL  Animal agriculture in the developed world provides only a small fraction (6% in the US) of carbon emissions, and most of that is beef. If you live in a developed country, cutting out ALL animal products from your diet would have a negligible effect on the environmental impact of your nation compared to cutting out beef, and only a minor effect compared to not doing anything (even assuming everyone did it).  On the other hand, cutting out fossil fuels alone would be enough to make your country almost fully stop contributing to climate change (the source is the linked article above that estimates developed country GHG emissions from fossil fuels at 80%, as well as the EU Roadmap 2050 (URL that sets the goal for a sustainable economy at 80% less GHG emissions).

"Dude, I'm vegan and I'll admit steak is fucking delicious.  Let's be honest, being vegan is not an easy choice and is one you have to make cuz you actually want to based on your own belief system. I went vegan not cuz I think eating meat is murder (and i would never tell anyone that because it is a very opinionated stance). I am vegan cuz i think the quality of mass produced meat is gross as well a cruel (which is different from thinking its murder). Same with dairy. I dont believe its good for you.  There is a reason why many people are lactose intolerant. But again I will say, everyone needs to come to their own reason as to why they stop eating meat. If not, it will be a short, inconsistant diet. So decide to become vegan or vegetarian based on an informed and individualistic belief. Whether it be because of humane reasons, health reasons or cuz you really want PETA to blow you. Just dont shame anyone for having a different belief please.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Can we please learn what the word 'theory' in scientific contexts means. 'Theories' are the graduation of scientific models when sufficient attempts to disprove a hypothesis fails. It is as confident a statement as is possible within the scientific community and everything we know and use in science is a theory. Theories are only broken when something disproves it and the disproof is repeatable and verifiable. So to be abundantly clear, a theory doesn't imply uncertainty, it is the word given to models and explanations of the highest degree of confidence that the scientific method is capable of providing. If you're going with the argument that 'X is just a theory', then you may as well throw out everything else we know about science along with it because everything we know about it is derived by the same methods.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"@Contrapoints:   I genuinely enjoy all of your work here quite a bit.  However, I find it difficult to agree with you on this issue not from a general sense ('Hey, we should definitely care about our actions and their effects on ecologies, local & global), but in a specific scientific sense - we just don't have enough data currently to predict anything at all about future climatic structures.  I say climatic structures, because it is very possible that we are seeing a fractured climate compare to the normal, with warmer arctic areas, and relatively unchanged tropics (which is what is currently happening) with very different weather, but rather similar climate (ie, big, stronger tropical storms, but generally similar tropical temperatures).  For instance, Siberia, prior, and in some areas even during the last ice age, contained massive prairies, and sustained ecologies strong enough to feed herds of mastodons.  Is that good? Bad? For who? How?  Also we rarely take in account the role of the Sun in our climate.  Many scientists are claiming that a future cool down of the Sun (temporarily) is coming, per its own 'weather' cycles, which will significantly affect the amount of heat which reaches our planet in the first place.  Again, good?  bad?  no one knows because we severely lack the necessary data to predict this.  Are oil companies shitty?  Of course.  Should people be vegan? Yes, for many reasons.  Are we all going to die in an infernal climate change apocalypse?  Not at all likely unless an incredibly specific number of instances occur over the next century, given absolutely no change in our technological capacity, and assuming current if not larger growth patterns from economic and population stances....  it is very very much an idea with a basis in reality, but not a tested, tried and true theory.

"So we went from the 'Greenhouse effect', to 'Global Warming', to 'Climate Change', all in the space of 30 years.  Every single climate science prediction has been incorrect on a grand scale.   I remember learning about the 'Greenhouse Effect' at school, when I was 10 years old.  My teacher told me that scientists has proven that by the year 2010 the earth would have warmed by 5 degrees.  Utter nonsense, as it turned out.   I am not claiming that humans have no affect on the warming of the planet, I believe we do.  I simply don't believe we are to blame for the whole lot.    If you look at the worst offenders, China, the USA, India, and Russia are disaster zones.  The country I lie has very low carbon emissions, and I will not take on collective guilt for what a minority of countries are doing to the planet, when I have nothing to do with these countries.     Instead of putting a blanket carbon tax on everyone, we should consider that cattle produce a huge amount of Co2, and if we all went meat free it would have the most positive effect on the planet.     Also taxing gas guzzling 4x4's like Jeeps and Land Rovers should be a priority.  People should be driving small, semi electric cars unless they can prove they need the vehicle for their business, or they have more than 3 children in their family under the age of 18.    For those who want to drive around in a huge 4x4 Land Rover or similar with only one person in the vehicle, new laws should be made taxing the hell out of them.  People need to be more responsible in their choice of vehicle.    These two measures would make a massive difference to the planet.  Knowing that 2/3rds of the non-ice covered land mass of the planet is used for animal agriculture (and food in general) is disgusting!     On the same amount of land it takes to 'grow' 1 kilogram of beef you can grow 100 kilos of potatoes or tomatoes, and use FAR less water.  We also would save energy and land growing all the grain that the animal agriculture industry needs to feed the cattle.   This land could then be used for growing non-meat products, and we would have about half of the land left over for green energy usage like wind turbines, solar panels and other (hopefully better) forms of green energy.  I believe nuclear energy is a much better option than crude oil and coal.  We should be spending money on developing Thorium nuclear reactors because the current 'green energy' options are simply not good enough to sustain us as a species.     Carbon taxes just hurt the poor though, and are a terrible idea.  Tax private jets.  Tax 4x4 vanity vehicles, tax luxury products which use a lot of energy to make, and start finding alternatives to fossil fuel based plastics (like hemp plastics which bio-degrade).     Also, stop blaming the everyday person.  Blame the governments in conjunction with multi-nationals who don't give a rats ass about the planet, as long as they can make some short term cash.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is part of what infuriates me about California's drinking straw ban.  Drinking straws are an accessibility measure, necessary for people who have defects that prevent them from drinking directly from a glass or people like me with overly sensitive teeth.  The amount of plastic waste produced by drinking straws in negligible.  Meanwhile I can't even buy the simplest of products at the store without it containing massive amounts of plastic packaging in addition to all the plastic grocery bags.  The burden of fixing these problems can't be on us because we are left with few to no options.  We can attempt to be conscientious with our purchases and bring reusable bags to the store, but more often than not we simply have no option but to either get the products we need and increase plastic waste or go without.  The burden must instead be placed on these companies producing these products to choose different materials without increasing the price point for us. And yet despite all of this, a pointless band-aid fix of banning straws just punishes the consumer and disabled people.  The system is broken from top to bottom because in order to do the change in materials like I said, it would increase manufacturing cost.  I say don't push that expense on the consumer, so the companies will take it out on employees.  Meanwhile, the owners and CEOs won't see a single change in their salaries.  It's all bad.  Revolution at this point really is the only option.  Revolution over straws, yes, I really did get to here from straws.  I will make my sign out of straws.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

We are still so locked in the battle with lizardfolk about the existence of climate change that there isn't enough (any) attention being paid in the public discourse to the need that we need to look past carbon emission reduction and towards carbon reclaimation/capture solutions.   This is a message we created and we (humans I mean) are on the hook for cleaning it up as well.

I just discovered your channel yesterday, Natalie, and have been binging (and now supporting) your work.

"The problem is climate scientists aren't engineers.  They only can present the cause of the problem, not the solution.  Presenting problems without also having solutions in hand tends to be a turn off.  What we needed and still need is engineering solutions to reduce emissions without an increase in cost and without compromising on quality of life and comfort.  Elon Musk is a good start with the Tesla, but we also need Manhattan project level funding of nuclear fusion, and development of carbon neutral    Farming technologies and development of carbon sequestration technologies.  Instead of living in vegan teepees, we need to use science to science our way out of this mess.  Of course the problem is that many people with lets just say left of center political views see climate change as an opportunity to try and impose change that has little to do with addressing climate change and more to do with dismantling capitalism which they see as a cause of climate change so why not kill two birds with one stone.    This of course is dumb because it hardens moderate and yes conservatives hearts from wanting to take any action.  In this way leftists tend to be unhelpful at times in terms of actually building consensus and getting anything useful done.

"Great video, but the ending seems indicative that you're in favor of pandering to the right and creating a climate narrative suited to their worldview which is the very cause of our crises in the first place. The problem, just as much as the specific 100 companies, is capitalism's systemic antagonistic outlook on nature. If we want to solve this problem, we can't just craft a bipartisan bridge by using their own rhetoric, because that exact outlook is how we got here; we need to fundamentally change our cultural outlook on nature to one of mutualistic synergy instead of exploitation and domination. Yeah, sounds vague and abstract as fuck, but there are projects to do exactly that in (oh man, Appeal to Rojava should be documented as a leftist informal fallacy) Rojava (Make Rojava Green Again in particular), in order to repair the wartorn, terrorized landscape and preserve the other pillars of their revolutionary project including cultural preservation, gender liberation and radical democracy.

"No one wants to go nuclear or study hydrogen production. Not even the left understands the correct energy solutions to this problem. If you think a lithium battery solar power grid is the solution you haven't actually done proper research either. Solar is cheap, Nuclear is not, Lithium is expedient, Hydrogen is not. The left is giving token amounts of funding to the wrong areas and lording themselves over the right. If something is worth doing it's worth doing correctly, especially saving the fucking planet. And no, driving a hybrid or electric car doesn't reduce emissions, driving a used, a small car does. You know people who buy electric cars constantly replace those things right? Those cars have such a shitty resale value because they don't fucking last. Again, lithium batteries are dog shit when hydrogen doesn't degrade over time. See you're not doing the research either.

Whether you are Jewish or not (and if you've ever mentioned it, I haven't seen every video), I really think it would be responsible to address this. It's obvious you aren't trying to seeeecretly instill antisemitism into your viewership, but how you use reptilians seems to just be putting the caricature on a powerful group of people without addressing that it's a caricature used against marginalized people. I'm saying something because you are very talented and influential and I adore your content and want to see it continue being influential among leftists.

"You had me up til the 'Pure, clean, natural foods' comment. Love your work and will continue to be a loyal viewer and yes, commercial ranching is highly problematic but so is commercial farming. The hard shift from 'Eat less red meat' to preaching the virtues of veganism was jarring, especially after criticising meat eaters for the same behaviors. There are legitimate arguments for eating meat because we are omnivores.  There are also legitimate arguments for plant based diets so long as that diet includes appropriate vitamins and dietary supplements. If you are going to advocate a plant based diet please also advocate the use of high quality dietary supplements. While most B Complex vitamins and Omega 3 supplements are made from animal biproducts there are some decent synthetic supplements on the market.  While I'm sure this comment will either be ignored or treated as an assault against vegans this is an important issue. In fact it's the most important issue humanity has ever faced since the advent of the atom bomb. The potential end of human life on earth can not be taken lightly. As you clearly stated, the overwhelming majority of C02 production is the result of a handful of major corporations and separating one's plastics from their aluminum and going vegan, though making us feel better about ourselves, aren't going to make any tangible difference. What will, also as you clearly stated, is getting involved politically.  Just a few thoughts, keep up the good work and thank you.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I agree sith the vast majority of this video, though the pushing veganism thing kind of discredits the video as a whole slightly. I agree that people need to be more conscientious of what they're consuming, but removing all animal products really isn't the answer. Removing some could help the environment, but some are honestly beneficial and we would be worse off without them.   A lot of vegetable farming relies directly on animal farming to be efficient, or benefits from it greatly. Livestock consumes a lot of wastes that we dont use from farming, like corn shucks and stalks.Using manure is better than fertilizers in most cases, as manure releases nutrients gradually and has less destructive runoff than chemical fertilizers. Making clothes from cotton and wool is much better for the environment than various synthetic plastics that break down slightly every time they are washed and release particles into the water that will never break down.   Not to mention some animal products are able to be used without harm to the animals if it is done ethically. Animal consumption will never stop. And honestly, it shouldn't. Its much more effective and realistic to advocate for the consumption of more ethically and responsibly acquired animal products than it is to advocate for them being removed entirely. Like acquiring eggs and meat from local farmers or companies that are more responsible. Boycotting all animal products just gives more power to large industries and makes smaller and less destructive farmers struggle.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Great episode as always! I think the only thing I might object too, as a certified poor person, that eating pure vegan is less expensive. Things like lentils and beans are absolutely cheaper but a lot of the other types of food like barley, brown rice, and quinoa especially can be astronomically expensive due to market factors, pricing out the poorest people out of a vegan diet, especially when consuming a vegan diet requires a tad more monitoring of certain nutrients that you might miss out on if you're not careful. I don't disagree with the premise that  you should go vegan if you can, but I think the principle should generally be to do the most good you CAN do, since especially in the age of super mergers and international conglomerates, consumer choices are not as impactful as before and, as you said, corporations produce 71 percent of emissions so consumers can't make the difference alone.   I personally try to pile what vegetables I can and tend to go for chicken and eggs over fish and ESPECIALLY beef, but when I have to choose between a filling meal (or whatever the food bank provides) and a measly amount of vegetable, I'm going with the option where I don't starve.  As I always say, money doesn't buy happiness but it buys choices. Especially consumer choices to make bigger individual contributions to help reduce the effects of global warming.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There is one piece of good news here: public health has already been looking into the 'Angry Jack Effect' for years now. Of course, that sector has its own name for it: reactance. The knee-jerk response which results from any perceived restriction on personal freedom, no matter how well-meaning or minuscule. Turns out that if you're looking to make somebody quit smoking, one of the worst ways of doing so is to tell them, 'you should quit smoking.' This is especially true if you are in some position of authority, even nebulous authority; this is why doctors regularly face this. After all, they are in the business of trying to improve people's health, but faced with what could be seen as a limitation on their freedom from an authority figure, the average smoker's response is hostility, even doubling down on their habits. That's what I think is the great tragedy of climate change: a poor understanding of reactance has contributed to climate change denial. But the good news is that doctors have spent decades trying to figure out how to work around reactance, and they've figured some things out. That gives me a bit of hope: turns out you can actually convince somebody to quit smoking, if you know what you're doing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

At this point I really don't understand how anyone older than their 20s can still deny it. I'm 40 and it has visibly changed in my lifetime. It really struck me a few years back when a friend showed me some video of us from 1995. There's gawky, seventeen year old me wearing jeans and long sleeves on a June afternoon in Fresno. That outfit is unthinkable now.  In May of 2004 I was at an event on the San Joaquin River and the temperature was around 105. We talked about how hot it was, at the time it was still unusual for the area to be so hot that early in the year. These days that's normal. That one stands out to me because it was the first time I noticed, I was thinking about how we'd dread the heat of August when I was a child back in the 80s, and here was a day like that in May.

"If this is so dire (and it is) why isn't anyone clamoring to just do it already?!  We could transition to clean energy a lot faster if the government would just sit down a group of experts and have them figure out the most efficient way to position renewable energy plants and storage facilities as well as electric car manufacturing plants to generate all the clean energy we need and then some and to have more than plenty of storage in case of the cloudiest windless conditions, and then the government buys up the land and resources it needs with eminent domain and starts building them, and as capacity grows then the government could order the closure of fossil fuel plants and fossil fuel car manufacturers and recall fossil fuel vehicles (while giving the owner a new electric car) by force of law.  Yet even the most vociferous proponents of a clean energy transition only propose things like subsidies, taxes, and maybe a few small mandates such as California putting solar energy on every roof of every new house.  This is an emergency. We cannot rely on the market to deal with an emergency that threatens our very existence! A top-down planned solution, informed by expert opinion with the objective of total replacement of dirty energy with clean energy is what we need. I'd even support of requiring people to work on jobs necessary for the transition (such as construction workers) if there were a labor shortage. We have jury duty so why not 'save your species from extinction duty' as well? Granted that could compromise efficiency and slow the project down due to people who didn't really want to be there, but it could speed up the project due to better labor supply too, so I would favor allowing experts to come together and make that decision based on what ever the math says will cause the transition to go faster.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Ever since that recent report came out I kept thinking about my life choices as in career. I thought why I was pursuing the interests I have when the earth is in trouble? But then I refits not the earth. It ain't gonna blow up or something. It's just that life will get a lot harder for humans. then I realized me pursuing my interests isn't what's causing the issue. To solve this problem it's about getting people in charge who actually want to do something about this. It's about making lifestyle changes. I can do these while pursuing my interests at the same time. I also realized it's not that we don't know what to do. We DO. It's just that we have people in charge who won't do it. I think the problem can be remedied. Will things get worse first? Probably. Could it require more extreme means? Yes. But I think it's doable. The Paris agreement was proof of it. I have a friend who thinks it's more on China than us and yet China is still in the agreement! So the rest of the world will exceed the U.S at something else, shocker. But at least large parts of the world are fighting. It's funny but in a way this video gave me more hope that it can be done rather than fear","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a longtime fan of this channel I love this video.  I've been hoping Natalie would tackle climate change at some point, and this video did not disappoint. As usual, production values (especially for youtube) are through the roof, and the subject is extensively well-researched. That being said, I do want to push back a little against Natalie's insinuation that adopting a vegan lifestyle is a necessary component of fighting climate change. While a vegan lifestyle certainly _can_ help, it's also totally unnecessary. It seems Natalie has (at least somewhat) bought into the false dichotomy presented by most vegans: that you either go vegan _or_ you're a careless meat eating polluter who is actively helping to destroy the earth. The thing is, there totally are sustainable alternative animal farming practices that not only produce little to no carbon emissions, but can actually reduce emissions in the long run. Do a google search for 'adaptive multi-paddock' or 'AMP' grazing. Vegans conveniently ignore the fact that it has been totally scientifically proven that we can continue to eat meat _and_ reduce carbon emissions from animal farming to net zero. We don't have to stop eating meat at all, we just have to change our farming practices. But vegans pretend this isn't a thing because it goes against their _real_ agenda of 'don't hurt the poor widdle animals'. So they pretend their lifestyle is all about saving the environment when in reality it's all about the fact they have the mindset of children who think 'Charlotte's Web' is a goddamn documentary or something and the idea of poor little Wilbur getting sent to the slaughterhouse makes them cry. Not to mention the false dichotomy also lets them feel morally superior to meat eaters. It's a win-win for their egos! If they *really* cared about the environment they would promote animal agriculture _reform_ rather than abolition. It's a much easier stance to get people on board with, and much more practical in the long run. But as long as vegans continue to see animals as a bunch of lovable furry buddies instead of the walking biofuel for our stomachs that they really are, they'll continue to conveniently ignore the more practical and achievable alternatives","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is great video, but I'm a little sad you didn't mention the current best solution in combating climate change. Injection of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere is an actually feasible solution that will counteract the affects of carbon dioxide as sulfur dioxide absorbs shorter wavelengths of radiation (which is primarily what's coming from the sun). We have already seen examples of this working from volcanic eruptions, mainly the Pinatubo eruption. Real Engineering recently did a video on this that does a fantastic breakdown of the idea.  I don't want to assume you didn't know any of this, and I think you're just focusing more on the politics and sociology surrounding climate change. Which is completely fair, we still do need to kick our reliance on fossil fuels eventually, but I think it would have been a good point to bring up to try and bring people over to the side of actual climate science.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Oh God, you did it! You cited Cook et al. The Cook 'study' is so full of holes. Consider: The Cook study was a study of abstracts of 11,944 abstracts on articles published between 1994 and 2011. 66.4% of these expressed no position on AGW (anthropogenic global warming), 32.6% endorsed AGW. .7% rejected, and .3 were uncertain. Thus '97% agree' is actually more like '97% of those who expressed an opinion agree...or 34.43% agree...whichever'. Then there's the problem of the sample size, as 11,944 papers actually isn't many, given that N=43,548 papers over the same period. Then there's the problem of the methodology...this 'work' was done by 12 volunteers (it was....ugh...'citizen science'..conducted by the Skeptical science website and this group of nerds have an innate bias. At least the Cook study was honest enough to acknowledge that bias by stating 'the volunteer raters endorsed the view that humans cause global warming, thus they may have been more likely to classify papers as sharing endorsement'. Then there's the idea of abstracts themselves...they're so ambiguously worded and require so much interpretation...There's more....there's so, so much more. I'll just repeat 'OH GOD YOU DID IT!

"Seizing the means of production don't mean much if production has to stop. I like the vid, but the idea that ' immoral corporations' are how we got here, that 70% of carbon dioxide emissions is their fault, arg. They are not throwing tires on a burn pile, and having money fall out of the sky. 'They' are making widgits, and dodads, that 'we' buy. I built electric vehicles in the 90's and 00's. The most common question I got was 'can't you just put a genny on the front wheel and charge the batts?' Energy has no correlation to economics. Energy is about physics, economics is no better than astrology, when it comes to making predictions. Example: an average human can produce about 2kwh in a 'work day'. I can buy 2kwh worth of electricity for less than 40 cents.  If the right is willfully ignorant about science, the left is  near as dumb about scale. Mmm, everybody is dumb about scale. Food has an energy cost near equal to it's caloric value, because we no longer(for the most part) make it with human labor. We use machines. Your laptop uses more energy than YOU do. A car uses magnitudes more energy than a sack of meat and bones. Could humanity replace carbon-emitting energy with sun-beams and tree farts? Perhaps, but it is a daunting problem of scale. Not the economic kind of scale, but one of physics, where 'we lose money on every one, but make it up in volume' does not apply.  Science can inform us. even recommend  'what'  should be done, the 'how' is a sonofabitch.

I didn't think I was better than her; I'm not very judgemental and after all, she had me under the impression our shopping habits were similar anyway.

There has also been little sympathy extended to coal miners, who have been instead berated for being racist and essentially told to 'get a job' by liberals, or dismissed with cries of 'let them eat opioids', instead of reassured through the creation of new jobs, campaigns of reskilling, or the proposal of universal basic income.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Let's be clear on that distinction. If the democrats get in then they'll still be pushing neoliberalism and supporting those world-bashing companies. If you look elsewhere in the world, you can often see left/right consensus on climate change. Look at Germany for example. It's important to build that and not alienate half the voting public from the discussion. And it's also important to forge a new politics that criticises both sides for gross inaction.

"Hi Natalie. Love this video, like all your others. There are some additional points that I think you could've raised here. 1 - A more thorough discussion of the intersection between class and the ability to practice veganism. While a vegetable-based diet is on its face cheaper than one that includes meat, I think it's worth mentioning the existence of things like food deserts, people without access to cars or public transport to buy groceries, people with disabilities that may not be able to prepare their own food, etc. While these may not apply to the majority of people, I still think it's important to take into consideration, as I have seen many of my own leftist friends act in a way that I think is borderline classist and ableist in discussions about the environment.   2 - This is more of a minor point, as I'm not sure if this line was meant to be satirical or not, but when Doc mentions eating 'pure, clean' vegetables', I'm a little bit wary of that wording. The assignment of moral value to certain foods can be a precipitating factor for individuals with eating disorders (myself included). I think the point would serve the same purpose if you'd perhaps worded it like, 'think of all of the vitamins and minerals you'd be getting from eating more fruits and vegetables!'  That said, this is an excellent video as always. :)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hi, do you think people should just give up? Cause lately, I've read a lot about torturing in jails and concentration camps so I really don't understand why should we try because human nature is just really screwed up and whatever we do we end up murdering, starving each other and so on so Schopenhauer was right all along.  How can you function as a healthy human being knowing that this very second someone is dying in a camp being beaten to death and no one can help them and nobody really cares?  It's just that they all are shouting in pain right into your ear and then you have to eat and sleep and move on? That makes no sense. Yet it feels like making it a big deal and demanding it to stop by all means necessary is somehow considered naive and stupid even. They always tell you that there's nothing you can do about it and they are right I guess. But if those people were tortured in our sidewalk, wouldn't people postpone their business and immediately come to an aide? They'd be angry and appalled and demand it to stop.   Why then if something is happening in distant places we can just forget about it?  It's still happening. We know it's happening.  How can we live with that?     I know that I can. That's sick. Could it be that so many awful things happen in the world all at once that we just numbed ourselves? I can not blame working people who struggle to feed their families for their lack of concern for Korean prisoners and children prostitution in Thailand. Yet I feel helpless.    Donating shit to world organisations is clearly not enough. For me, it's just clearing my conscience. I also don't believe that starting bloody wars and revolutions can stop the sufferings of people. The only thing I want is to stop being part of it altogether. The worst part is that I feel like we got used to that somewhere in time and now being really upset and demand an immediate resolution to a problem is naive and silly.  It's like being born into a world where everyone is already a rhinoceros so freaking out and asking questions are just impolite and bad.  I'm sorry for such a long text.

"To give people an idea of what regular people on the Right in the United States are about, I, a reasonably typical Global Socialist, have been accused of being a Rosenberg and supposedly Global Warming is a left-wing conspiracy to harm the capitalist engine of economic growth.  The American populist Right isn't just scared of the federal government, as they stockpile weapons and prepare to battle Washington, they are terrified of reality itself. Anyone foolish enough to try to talk to them as if they are rational is in for a really bad time.  There's nearly no connection between reality and the American populist Right. When the left talks about the 'coming dark ages' as the educational system is defunded, it's sadly naive. The educational system has never been good - it's an ideological hell-hole regardless of funding. We've been living in the dark ages the entire time.

"I was lucky enough to see Al Gore's presentation in person, and it really didn't change my mind because I had learned about it years before - *in school* .Who would have thought some educational systems think science is important? So, people clapped and welcomed him but it was just a general feeling of 'You're preaching to the choir, buddy' I sorely resent South Park's creators for the ManBearPig episode, because healthy sckepticism is is fine, but good sense (like regulating carbon emissions and better industrial practices) is better as a preventive principle.  They recently recanted, yet I can't help but think they carry a lot of the guilt for the developed world ignoring or even ridiculing those allerting us to this issue.  In any case, regardless of your stance on this, I think it's universally agreed upon that polution is bad, and getting your energy from free sources like the wind or the sun is good.

EDIT - Just for those doubting the US is the only major nation activelly trying to discredit the claims that this is happening and pinning it on conspiracies to make liberal scientists further their agendas aimed at ruining fossil fuel industries, the very oil-wealthy middle eastern super economies are investing heavily in renewables, specifically solar. _The people with money comming out of their ears because of oil are changing to solar_ .

"Nothing in this video is wrong. But it's just kind of...pointless.  Trump and the GOP are ludicrously bad on the climate, of course. But no alternative that is remotely politically plausible is a whole lot better. Yeah, it's bad that we've pulled out of the Paris Agreement, but that deal was feckless to begin with. It was non-binding, and even if everyone who signed met their obligations it still wouldn't be enough to keep us under two degrees global warming. At least that amount is already baked in. And there's a growing view that even that (rather arbitrary) limit was probably too much. The Paris Agreement was better than nothing, but it was pretty damn close to being effectively nothing.  Something that's been consistently true about climate change predictions is that things keep happening both sooner and to a worse degree than most of the predictions say. Conservatives aren't driving us towards a cliff because we're already over the edge.   It's no longer about preventing climate change; now we're into the 'mitigate how bad it will be' stage. And to do even that will require a WW2 level of mobilization. But we can't even get a real carbon tax in most places, something that should have been imposed universally at least twenty years ago. No one in mainstream, viable politics is talking about serious plans to meet the monumental challenge before us.  Of course, that assumes there actually is anything we can do at this point. The positive feedback loops have already started. The Antarctic ice melt is now self-sustaining, and the Siberian permafrost appears to be increasingly vomiting up its methane. We likely don't have time left to accomplish any kind of Green Revolution, which has serious limits to what it could realistically accomplish even if it were robust (and a lot of what is being trotted out under that label is band-aid stuff at best).  I don't quite adopt the Guy McPherson view that humanity will be exinct by the end of the century, but I genuinely think we're looking at the end of globalized, industrial civilization as we know it. It's happened before, it can happen again.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"74% of Americans can't even adequately prepare for retirement.  Combating global warming is essentially asking everyone to start a savings account (go with the typical concept of deposit % of paycheck somewhere to gain interest and prepare for retirement, I'm highly aware savings accounts suck).  Its a hard subject for me because I think even if everyone in the US believed in human caused climate change, we would still have to deal with our representatives never doing or attempting to do what we hired them to do.    I have Vegan friends who are constantly pushing veganism and it just isn't an achievable goal outside of a Military Government taking over the world and forcing everyone at gun point.    I think we are at least on the right track.  Tesla's are popular on the left and right.  LED's are industry standard and typically required to meet energy code.    I do wish Inhoffe would die. Its hard for me to think of him as an actual person.  I think I might be even angrier at him if I did.  I live in Oklahoma.  Our politicians are the worst.  We rarely get anyone we want elected. In the last election, out of 20+ some odd positions elected, I think 3 of the people I voted for got elected.  And most of our democrats are basically just republicans (dem gov candidate was anti-recreational marijuana and also an ex-cop, dem lieutenant gov candidate is against homosexual marriage and adoption, etc).

A vegan propoganda 'documentary' came out talking about the *methane* in cow farts. Which is ridiculous because animals fart, it's a natural fucking emission. And besides they took the amount from all agriculture and blamed it all on cows, when rice paddies is the biggest producer of methane emissions by FAR.   Also I'm pretty sure my Canadian ass getting produce shipped up here from California, Mexico, central and south america causes more carbon emissions than getting milk from Ontario cows and beef from Alberta and Ontario cows.  Also plant based meals don't cost less here jfc. They might for you living in a state that produces produce for most of your own country and several others, but on the other side of the continent in a country that's frozen half the year?? Yea no!!  (Also colonizers slaughtered bison in North America en masse around the agricultural revolution, and Canadian cows are mostly pasture raised on what was originally grasslands - and still fucking is. Grasslands are carbon sinks. Happy ecosystems - complete with large hooved animals for soil aeration. Unlike the monoculture hell that's destroying several ecosystems through killing all the local fauna and flora and drying out everything with water intensive crops like avocado and almond .

It's better to observe, record, measure the ongoing impacts to present the possible impact of climate change. What you need to understand is the republican do not want to spend money on something they fear would not bring concrete result. The main emission is still from China and soon the developing world, whose reach is outside of the US and main drives is the world consumption habit. There are efforts into researching solution to cool the earth artificially to buy time for society to move away from carbon but those research are being seen as taboo.

"Electric cars are really far away from being a solution to climate change as it still requires rare metals mining, that are deeply polluting some regions of the earth. It makes their inhabitants slaves because of the high market demand; their condition of work are terrible, dangerous and less and less cost-effective for them. It is not by making a product look green, that it will be the go-to solution, especially when an innovation is only making a change in which technology we use and not in how we use technologies. A car is still a car, as it needs mass production to fulfil the ego of the individual. It is an illusion to promise the rich that he is actually saving the planet and to reassure him that he can still continue living his way of life, in a bubble of luxury, without having to watch the dirty poor people who actually enable him to buy stuff that cheap.

"Great video!   I gotta ask though, can technology add some borrowed time to this whole thing, as it were? I know there's companies and the like heavily investing into green technology, carbon capture, etc.   Like, are these reports based on the assumption that technology to combat this threat won't improve in 10-20 years? That's rather disingenuous.   Speaking of which, I believe that 10-20 years is a bit too broad a timeframe to be making predictions like this. Yes, of course, what you guys mentioned is perfectly plausible and is a serious threat.

"When u finally make people see that the theory of global warming is factually sound the true work is convincing people why they should care. You did a good job with the symbolism of the sea, but instead of making the enemy the 'other' side you could say that human survival doesn't effect people based on politics. And that the polices of the American government aren't negative because they are chosen by a republican leader, but by a person who values money over the future of the country he was elected to serve (which isn't simply a republican sentiment). So with the divisive points set aside this can be said, if people don't want to care about the earth they *can do that, but in the end the earth cares even less about humans, it has been here before us and it will be after, so humans will not benefit or 'win' by not caring, they will kill themselves. And this may make a difference, bc we all know that people sure as hell care about dying. Great video Natalie ","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Let's not even consider the ludicrous proposition of staying below 1.5 in the next 12 years (might as well say 'cut 80% of all emissions worldwide by tomorrow') How is 0 emissions by 2050 (31 years) in any way feasible? We would have to turn almost every political, economical and social system everywhere on Earth inside out within the span of 3 decades. Changing the way BILLIONS of people live their lives on every level in 30 years. 30. Fucking. Years. And good luck finding a way to make sure everyone toes the line, because we can't afford any screwups.  And the funny thing is, this mindbogglingly gargantuan feat wouldn't even be enough! 'Cause the carbon that's already in the atmosphere is enough to support positive reinforcement cycles (like polar ice melting, or forests being wiped out by extreme weather events) so we would have to scrub it away using technology that doesn't even exist. Technology we would have to research, develop and implement all the while not allowing a whiff of CO2 in the atmosphere. This is not even climate fiction anymore, we're balls deep in the realm of delusion. I'm sorry if I come across as excessively confrontational, but I just find it childish how we're unable to accept that we're fucked and Capitalism robbed us of all of our agency as individuals to fix things. It's depressing, but the genie is out of the bottle on this one. This is a conversation we needed to have 40 years ago, now we just count our blessings and prepare for the worst. Because it is coming. Still, if you wanna do some activism or change something about your lifestyle, by all means do it.

"We'll change when the consequences come to our door. When there is real survival at stake, we'll get crafty. I love survival stuff, went to school for primitive survival and got into a natural gardening obsession initially with the idea of growing all my own food. We might have to make biodomes, allow sunlight in but keep poisons out. Feeling drawn to the walipini underground greenhouse as a good start, would have to figure out air/water filtration. Nuclear fallout would SUCK, sure hope it doesn't go that far. If nothing else we can go underground, perhaps wire solar/wind/water power production down from the surface to grow lights. Chickens would be great down there, help speed up composting of our food scraps while producing eggs. Separate human urine/feces and mix the pee with ashes as fertilizer and mix the manure with carbon waste like shredded cardboard to compost properly and eventually use in the orchard. So many ideas, it'd be really hard. I'd probably fail and die, even with all I know from years of obsessive research and practice and the help of many other people. Something very attractive about all that, part of me hungers for a vivid life, real survival. Life feels kind of empty when it's this easy. I've never been in danger of starving, I fast intermittently because I live in a sea of excess nutrition and the things statistically most likely to kill me are heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes. We're drowning in success. Maybe we're subconsciously trying to make all this collapse so we can go back to survival mode because our brains are hardwired for it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"We had a drought in my country over this summer which destroyed a lot of crops. There were also huge forest fires which lasted for days.   I don't think our politicians were prepared for that. They are right wing, which in my country means they want to privatize and sell off our welfare and infrastructure, while funding big oil and encouraging car and plane travel.   Soon enough the news were telling us to go stock up on canned foods and batteries and how we should all be prepared for a 'crisis' cutting us off from water and electricity. I thought it was pretty scary, but I felt like everyone around me was like, 'oh yeah that makes sense, we should probably all make doomsday kits' and I'm like, 'that's not the point though, our government could do something on the climate front and they won't, and now they're just leaving us to our own devices'.  Our climate here will probably get worse over the next few years, and I don't know if caring hurts too much because I can't really find anyone who seems to take it seriously. Like, even when we're facing wildfire and food shortage people just shrug and keep on travelling by plane and supporting irresponsible, racist right wingers like nothing even matters, like the idea of death by fire and starvation doesn't affect us. I feel like I'm going crazy, like everyone around me is one of those lizards in the bath in the video. What do? How fix? I want to find a way to end this comment but I can't find a conclusion or silver lining or anything, so.  Good video? I'm glad we get to see more of the scientist character?

"Oklahoma Transwoman here. Senator Inhofe's campaign should come at no surprise, most of our economy is based around the production of oil and natural gas, it pays for our schools, our roads and is a large source for jobs. God forbid, the alumni center at my college was paid for by Phillips 66 and the football stadium paid for by T. Boone Pickens , hell I even went to the same high school as one of the granddaughters of Love's Travel Stops (the Love family was distinguished enough as supporters that Trump appeared at their home ). People like these usually have oil in common and have a major influence over the state's interests, the state wants those tax dollars, and clash with the federal government on policy. Under the Trump administration their have been rollbacks on regulations for drilling new wells, some protections for animals and their procedures for dealing with them have been decreased allowing for more wells to be placed. Federal Policy can have a large impact on the lives of the people here, and of course our legislature reflects that. So we have to ask ourselves is the cost of saving the environment work giving up our economic prosperity worth it? Why of course it fucking is, you just run into the problem of telling those people they no longer have jobs because we have to cut back our oil production. I've personally seen it, my dad works in industry, and I've noticed the fluctuation of policy influencing the production of oil. And that production of oil trickles down to other industries, namely transportation, but closely the aerospace industry here in Oklahoma. The inception of OPEC led to increased gas prices in the 1970s which eventually led to GM to reducing labor cost, and recently outsourcing its labor and in the process Detroit becoming a barren wasteland. Policy has to walk the line of appeasing both sides ideally, but realistically coming up with a solution that works. But you've touched on the fact people are more likely to support things that make them money, they're interested in that new car because they like shiny things, and I feel I need to re-watch whats wrong with capitalism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"As for electric cars the are several misconceptions on their impact. Electric cars are very expensive to produce as of right now, the amount of precious materials required to produce a battery for one of these vehicles is staggering, just the copper alone, but also there is a large environmental cost, the materials have to be mined, shipped and then produced which requires a large amount of energy. The costs put them out of the price range of the average consumer and their intended effect does not meet a large enough population to have an effect. Tesla is not the greatest at this, they hold a monopoly on the market and do not sell extra parts, and good luck trying to fix it Tesla doesn't want that to happen either, its either send your car back to the factory to be fixed at a rate of $180 dollars an hour or stick your thumb up your butt. Not to mention green cars still rely on energy plants to produce the electricity to charge them, where does that come from? Coal. Really, the better option would be to keep our current cars and maintain them, many older vehicles production impacts on the environment have been recovered, we waste more energy producing newer cars. But this model is hard under capitalism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I have never commented on one of your videos before, but I believe your approach is not necessarily the right one. The solution to the problem, it seems, is readily available but unlikely ever to occur within the time frame specified. The  problem being that no one will risk economic instability to cut carbon emissions quickly . I think that it is best not to even confront those who deny climate change because there is too little time to worry about whether they understand the necessity of cutting carbon emissions. For example  by say  presenting subsidies on sustainable energy production as a viable way to create jobs and to lower the US dependence on foreign oil , you could convince people to make some of the changes necessary without ever having to take a position on climate change. As much as I appreciate your excellent video production and  the validity of all of your points, I believe that in an age of mass hysteria a more subversive approach is necessary.

It's not really a partisan issue whether it exists or not and whether something should be done about it, parties only disagreed on the specifics of what to do. Which renewable energy sources to build towards, the specific trashold of emission caps, that sort of stuff.

"Thank you so much for making this video.   I work in multiphase modelling for environmental systems, and largely work with the same equations that model climate change (RANS with different closures). They're literally conservation of mass, momentum, and energy with averaging operators. RANS are somehow reliable and non-political for pipeline scour and fluid catalytic cracking (i.e.: protecting oil's assets), but as soon as I mention climate change, all of a sudden I'm a liberal forcing my political views down people's throats and somehow they know more about this than I do. My mom literally told me that, while she didn't understand the tools I used, she still didn't believe me. I can attest that being in this line of work has been a detriment to my mental health.  The first paper on human made climate change was published in 1896 (my research group was actually talking on Friday about forming a journal club and doing this article first). It's been over 120 years later, and I don't feel good about the future.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

He is the worst stereotypes of my country made flesh without embodying any of our stereotypical virtues.  He is greedy, he is trigger-happy, he is loud, he is willfully ignorant, and he thinks he's exceptional just because he's been told so his entire life.  I'd wish for his death, but then Pence would be president, and he's actually a competent politician (but he's still a fundamentalist idiot).  At this point, I find it unconscionable to vote for any Republican, because any of the one's that are actually reasonable won't speak up out of fear of being marginalized by the establishment GOP, which is now Trump's bitch.

"Brilliant as always. The shot of the moonlit sea is sublime.         At the risk of waxing philosophical, I have the feeling this all comes down to the death of God. Now that we all know (even those who deny it know it in their hearts) that God is dead, the only thing left to do is have as much fun as possible, or to try and expand our knowledge and attempt to become immortal by leaving great works behind. Thus a relatively long-term problem such as global warming is always going to appear unimportant when compared to the most important thing of all: our maximum expansion within our individual lifespan on earth.         I wonder if it might be possible to better link the left to this idea of individual expansion? What if opening our minds and hearts and taking action on all this stuff doesn't mean we would be holding ourselves back from doing what we really want to do (by not eating meat or using planes) but rather that we would be getting bigger and stronger and smarter? Not austerity but more power... And yet, there will always be the instinct to not let that power be dispersed among the crowd, to retain the right to be the rock star being worshipped on stage... This seems like an unsolvable dichotomy. And perhaps rightly so...      I suppose it comes down to the pleasure principle versus the reality principle. And what makes your videos so strong is that, more than a lot of other YouTubers, you're prepared to go into the appeal of the pleasure principle and of a certain right-wing energy and world-view, to pay your respects to the Devil as well as make fun of his followers.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"To tell you the truth, i don't actually believe in climate science. Carbon dioxide is more soluble at lower temperatures. When weather is colder, more carbon dioxide dissolves into the ocean, when it is warmer, less dissolves into the ocean and remains in the atmosphere. Higher temperatures correlate with higher levels of CO2 because it's the temperature affecting the CO2 levels, not the other way around.  Or, maybe i'm wrong. We probably should reduce carbon emissions. It's better to be safe than sorry. The funny thing is that oil companies will be better off in a world that uses less oil, the world won't be weened off of it's dependence on oil so quick. The rate that we consume oil is unsustainable. They can meet a reduced demand with a reduced supply, selling less oil at a higher price for the same profits over a longer period of time.

"I find this easy to fap to.  F: Follow A: Articulated P: Points  In all seriousness, a great video. I do feel, however, there was one 'counter view' I feel you missed: Employment.  While on vacation, I stopped by a small town of about 10,000 people. In the hotel, the the town's tourism department had placed a brochure talking about the town. In that brochure they had listed the top 10 employers for the town. Six of those ten employers were Coal/Oil/Natural Gas companies or a power company that used Coal/Oil/Natural Gas. The town's government took up two spots on that list, and the final two spots were filled by the town's single chain grocery store and its single Walmart. From the news articles I've read, these coal/oil/natural gas jobs are often the only reliable way someone in a small town can make anything close to a wage to support a household; after seeing that brochure, I believe it.   Ninety-seven percent of scientists may be right about man-made induced climate change, but I can imagine it's much easier to listen to the three percent that say 'you can keep yer job'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"South Park actually just made a 2 part episode apologising to Al Gore for not believing him. They still stand by saying that him being so fervent in all of this was a desperate grab for attention after losing the presidency, but baby steps have been made. They agree that climate change is real (fucking finally) and that we need to act now and stop being so goddamn greedy. The example they gave was giving up red dead redemption 2 and soy sauce to appease manbearpig on a metaphorical level (with the people of south park being too selfish to even give that up) but its clear that they believe that we need to give up lifestyle choices that have those effects of the environment or else the consequences will be cataclysmic, and they doubt that anyone will. A pretty cynical way to look at it, but not one i particularly disagree with. Humans are suckers for luxury and dont like giving things up. Case in point: the backlash against vegans that you yourself explained perfectly. I use my anaemia as an excuse not to go vegetarian even though i know its better for the environment and a cruel industry that i would rather not support. When really the main reason is I fucking love meat, and my iron levels are just an afterthought. Though i'd go a step further and say that we need to do more than police our lifestyle emissions. We need to do something about industrial emissions. But i'm glad more prominent moderate and conservative voices like South Park's creators Trey and Matt (who are both pretty centre-right and have a lot of influence on the general public) are changing their tune on climate change.

"I really doubt we can stop or slow climate change with consumer choice and just limiting the corporations emission.   The consumer choice is helpful but it focuses mostly to developed nations and ignores the desire to rising living standards.  How can I say to developing countries to choose green while they focus on just getting by and trying to reach similar living standards as us. We would probably  collectively have to accept some sort of living standards decrease to solve this to be this globally. This problem will no doubt bring conflict and political turmoil. In France for example currently there are protest against fuel tax rises which could be one of the concrete problem solving methods but are clearly really unpopular.    Limiting the emission of top 100 polluting corporations, which are mostly fossil fuel companies,  means we would have to solve energy requirements with renewable energy and while I see it as possible to some extent there are many industries that I can't see it to apply such as defense/war and heavy transportation.  Also the globally energy question is also inherently political to many nations as they form a fossil fuels form large parts of economy. In their national self interest using fossil fuel is good and brings them wealth. Thus any serious disruption to global state of order is national interest question. I think these countries will pay lip service to climate agreements but when push comes to shove they won't disrupt their source of wealth.   Main problem I see is that as climate change is a global problem we will need global solutions but they are notoriously hard to do. We would need countries to act against majorly their self interest on the sort term so we would need major economic or political motivators to ensure this. Economic motivators will be hard to do since even as little or simple as some foreign aid can be really unpopular and that is only if rich nations even want to commit some economic self harm in revolutionizing their industries and then helping less well of nations. And the political motivations would of course in this case be forceful and lead to conflict, disagreement and possible war.   The nations of the world would have to make really unpopular decisions and a method to enforce them. This enforcement would have to have actual teeth compared to most international organizations like UN. Sadly this will be impossible peacefully in current state of affairs as nations won't give any of their rights to enforce some global treaty which will only benefit them in the future and not to the present. We will be prisoners of the our desire to keep our living standards rising and keep the current state of affairs going even as the world crumbles before us.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"At this point, there is no way to stop global warming. What we should be doing in stead is investing into nuclear energy, hydroponic agriculture and vat-grown meat. That will solve literally all the (human) problems of global warming, without necessitating the mass immiseration of the proletariat. Also, veganism isn't natural or healthy. Nazi Germany did an accidental natural experiment in the 30s, restricting consumption of animal products and attempting to compensate by increasing plant consumption, in order to achieve economic autarchy.  Yet despite rising wages and falling unemployment (due to the armament industry boom), mortality rates skyrocketed and children became stunted, at a time when the rest of Europe was seeing widespread mortality reductions in all age categories. What is more, by far the worst affected group were not adults - whose suffering may have been affected by a harsher working conditions, due to the destruction of independant trade unions - but children between the ages of 7 and 15. Even the suffering of the Jews is not even close to big enough of a statistical factor to explain such massive anthropometric decline. URL","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Fact is, in 500 million years there will likely be no trace whatsoever that any of us existed beyond whatever gets fossilized. There has already been numerous extinction level events, some of which resemble the catastrophic predictions of global warming science, and more are coming. Greenhouse gas emissions might have something to do with the next mass extinction, but regardless, the sun will expend its core hydrogen, it has been slowly increasing in luminosity for this reason, and in 1 billion years or so the evaporation of the earth's oceans will be well underway. But before that time it is statistically inevitable that there will be a volcanic supereruption or meteor impact that will devastate the biosphere, and that's irrespective of whether or not humanity manages to avoid initiating a major nuclear war. Climate change is only the tip of the iceberg. Eventually the atmosphere of this planet will resemble present-day Venus, and very little of that will have anything to do with human emissions. Even if you could anticipate some way out of that for terrestrial life, the heat death of the universe after the Dark Era will be the unavoidable kill-switch of reality somewhere beyond 10^2500 years into the future.   There's a reason the universe is not awash in the radio signals from extraterrestrial civilizations, they probably are rare but even more importantly, they probably do not last very long; it has only taken us around 100 years to go from the development of radio technology to this flirting with self-destruction, nuclear or otherwise...

If our governments could agree on a worldwide price for carbon at the point of extraction or importation, and if they would stop subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, then market forces would drive UP the price of fossil fuels and make lower emission alternatives cheaper. Please see Citizens Climate Lobby for more information on how we can all make this happen to reduce emissions and create jobs in the green tech industries.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

That said, the 100 companies statistic is misleading-- if you read the original policy document, the 100 companies are just the 100 biggest sellers of fossil fuel, based on the assumption that all carbon emissions are ultimately from fossil fuel and somebody must have sold it to the people who burned it.  The other 29% of emissions aren't from individuals or other industries, they're from smaller companies with less market share.

"Okay, this aggrandisement of Al Gore is beyond the pale.  It was Dr James Hansen, the climate scientist, that raised the need for action on climate change. Not Al Gore. Not the guy who owns a private plane, has a massive residence, takes tens of thousands of dollars in speaking fees to offer an apocalyptic viewpoint, some Green pap about renewables, and then flies back to his high-energy American lifestyle. I hope Al Gore chokes on his jet plane exhaust, because the planet sure as hell is. I would say that Al Gore's hypocrisy and his profiteering off of 'awareness campaigns' have done more damage to the climate cause than advanced it.  Dr James Hansen has raised the need for unilateral action on climate change, irrespective of a globalised carbon trading 'market' by pushing for carbon fee and dividend. His supporters have put together a citizens climate lobby for legislated CFD that would provide an incentive for people to switch away from fossil fuels, and that does not require global agreements all too easily scuttled by commodity price cycles: URL He, in conjunction with other climate scientists like Barry Brook, Ken Caldeira and Kerry Emanuel - all highly cited and lauded people, has put forth genuine solutions for breaking this log jam. Promoting the secondary benefits of decarbonising, like avoiding 7 million annual deaths from combustion particulates. Promoting GMOs that are less fertiliser and water intensive and can use no-till farming that would otherwise lead to greenhouse gas outflows from agriculture. Promoting nuclear power that has historically been the powerhouse behind decarbonisation of economies like Japan, France, Sweden and Canada. (And now China, UAE, Korea).   This sermonising video does little to advance the conversation of how we decarbonise our economies. It is in fact a repetition of the same tired conversation that has led us to this entrenched stalemate and has destroyed any sensible dialogue we could have about climate change. Discussing _whether or not climate change exists_ when it is used by deniers to stonewall conversations about _solutions_ is as harmful as climate change deniers themselves. You are lowering yourself to their level.  Climate deniers _love_ to talk about 'the science'. They would love to debate the validity of the hockey stick curve, RCP 2.6, the Gulf Stream, the temperature record. There's an entire website for it called theGWPF.org ('The Global Warming Policy Foundation'). The problem with trying to debate on their level is that they will bring you down and beat you with experience.  What we _should_ be talking about instead, and what can break the logjam between conservatives and liberals, is: - The sensitivity of our economies to commodity price fluctuations in coal, oil and gas. The OPEC cartel proved in the 60s that they could crash the global economy by turning off the taps in the Middle East. We cannot allow foreign commodities to dictate domestic economic activity. - Corollary to this, domestic trade surpluses and deficits are due in large part to the cost of energy. We need to make clean energy cheaper than coal, oil, and gas, and as reliable and as portable. The industries that grow to displace them will employ our future generations and massive R&D needs to start today - That we spend billions of dollars in healthcare costs due to asthma and other respiratory conditions brought on by fossil fuel particulates. Fossil fuels have funded our economic growth since the Industrial revolution but now we need a cleaner alternative and to eliminate that pollution brake on health and prosperity  Do NOT engage with their denialism. Engage instead with their principles of growth and prosperity. Sidestep the science and talk instead about post-carbon.

"Ms Wynn, I would be careful with one of your later assertions that suggests that capitalism is ill-equipped to handle this problem. The self-revolutionising capacity of capitalism can be attributed, if David Graeber is to be believed, to its ability to sustain a state of mind in those who live under it that capitalism has an end. This was the case in the development of damaging bubbles in newly industrialised Britain, Holand and France, where capitalism was assumed to exist forever, and, consequently, irrevocably damaged and almost destroyed their monarchies. This was also the case during the Cold War, where the possibility of being replaced by a Soviet-style 'degenerated workers' state' strengthened capitalism around the world. Capitalism will use climate change as a way to continue itself, maintaining the system of inequality while claiming to be a force for good. The large opportunities to be had in the development of renewable energy reveals how government action towards the expansion of the energy industry is directed towards the interests of Capital, not away from it.  What the Americans, and the people of the world, need to be careful of in the pursuit of a more equitable economic system is not to treat the voices of the scores of individuals who wish to abandon capitalism as a legitimate show of movement away from Capital, for they make the strongest case for capitalism in the minds of the sedentary public. Rather, they must understand that capitalism has answers to the problems of climate change, but that these answers do not care for those who cannot, would not or do not (want to) join capitalism's rhetoric involving 'equal opportunity' and the  'free-market' metaphor.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Libertarian here.  Honestly, I think one of our biggest problems is the fact that the government subsidizes the oil industry at the expense of...literally everyone. The amount of oil the U.S. is in possession of would actually kill all of us if we attempted to burn it all, or even most of it (not to mention we got a lot of it from countries we shouldn't have fucked with in the first place).  Our economy itself is actually fully ready to go mainly renewable. In fact, we've been discovering more and more ways to REVERSE the effects of climate change. Once abandoned trash dumps are being revisited and used to recycle into clothing, technology, and more. The black forrest in Germany has been revitalized to be as lush as it was in the 1800's. More trees grow under the paper industry than they would otherwise, and even if this weren't the case (which it is), the flash drive has saved more trees than greenpeace ever has.  We're AWARE climate change is an issue, it's common knowledge, it's taught in schools, and U.S.A. civilians are prepared to go renewable . The only problem is that we have forced reliance on destructive corporations all because of corporatist policy out of our immediate control.  Now I'm not here to place the gov't as the boogeyman and say there's no hope. There absolutely is, and I urge anyone reading this to make sure their tax dollars aren't being used as blood money.   the inherent eroticism of the ocean is immeasurable and beautiful and I hope I reflected that in this comment.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Don't forget about climate change's infinitely more dangerous cousin, 'ocean acidification,' also being directly caused by having too much carbon in the atmosphere. Around 75% of the Earth's population lives on the ocean shore, and most of them survive off of their local fishing economies there. Well, if there's a cataclysmic global extinction event in the ocean's food chain because the lower links on that chain are LITERALLY being dissolved by an acidic ocean before they can even breed, then a PERMANENT global economic collapse followed by a PERMANENT lowering of the planet's carrying capacity is inevitable for our species.  And what has history taught us about human beings when their food production infrastructure and economic security utterly collapse out from under them in a short period of time? That's right. Warfare, genocide, mass migration, social distrust, and an inability to reestablish civil human society for several centuries afterwards. Believe it or not, humanity has been here before. Just look at the 'Late Bronze Age Collapse,' a civilization destroying event back during the Bronze Age initially brought on by mass starvation.

The person who will be running against my member of parliament actually called me... weird I know... and I had a half an hour chat about how mad I was about the change in prime minister and the reason for its occurrence. But this person has no chance of winning, this is a safe seat that has never gone to his party in history, my vote (which is still required here) cannot change the government.  His party policy announced recently is well okay, they tried, it's nice to have someone try, it will probably meet our Paris agreements, but we know now, that's not enough, Australia just had its largest CO2 emissions since 2004... we lost 6 years we needed to make a difference.

"Thank you for this. Seriously. I just got in a pointless debate on youtube about this topic. I usually don't post contrary material because I see no point in inevitably engaging with trolls, but I just said something about global warming and triggered a bunch of people who were triggered I was triggered. Someone made fun of my liberal tears, someone else told me that 'saving the earth sounds nice but it means too much sacrifice and will result in the killing of all poor people' (an argument I was not familiar with), and another person said climate science was too vague to worry about because 'we don't even know how bad co2 really is'.I don't understand how so many scientifically illiterate people genuinely think they know better than the experts. Dear lord.  EDIT: forgot to mention the brilliant retort I got of 'well, climate change is an inevitability. Ice ages happen, warming occurs, the earth changes and it is arrogant to think humans can do anything about it.' It is reminiscent of the idea 'if everyone dies eventually, then people should just run into the middle of busy intersections with their eyes closed.' It is baffling to me that even those who admit to climate change seem to throw up their hands in the air and would rather go on living like they do and have to terraform mars instead of making some sacrifices and attempt to save the only place in the known universe we are currently aware of that can sustain life. The earth won't end in a colossal boom where we all ascend painlessly to heaven, it will just start sucking so much harder. And harder and harder. And our cute little grandbabies will wonder why we let it happen so goddamn easy.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Finally talking about a very important topic.   Eating less animal products won't help us, we need to end animal agriculture.   FACTS with sources:   Animal agriculture is responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, more than the combined exhaust from all transportation. (URL  Livestock and their byproducts account for at least 32,000 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, or 51% of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. (URL  Livestock is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of nitrous oxide - a greenhouse gas with 296 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide, and which stays in the atmosphere for 150 years. (URL  Even without fossil fuels, we will exceed our 565 gigatonnes CO2e limit by 2030, all from raising animals. (URL  Not to mention water use - Animal agriculture water consumption ranges from 34-76 trillion gallons annually. (URL  Growing feed crops for livestock consumes 56% of water in the US.

It is also worth putting the animal suffering problem into perspective. Worldwide, 56 billion land animals are killed every year for food. Animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and Amazon deforestation. Nowhere in the world are humans being exploited in the magnitude and severity as non-human animals are.

Coastal cities worldwide will be under sea-water, whilst the grain-belt of the USA would be reduced to infertile sand dunes as the temperature rose and rainfall patterns changed. Curiously however, in the short-term at least, not everyone in the world would loose-out under global-warming. The exception is the vast Russian steppe region (currently infertile due to perma-frost) which would  thaw out, and could (for a while) become the new grain-belt, radically shifting global politics, as the USA would need to import all its food from Russia or starve, making Russia the dominant global superpower.

"20 to 12 years left. Huh, all this time I've been theroughly, genuinly, annoyed by people to the point it's just full on hatred now. Let's review the facts we know: First, we've been repeatedly shown time and time again that the Far-Right/Conservatives don't care about the people and those around the  world as the oh-so-claim. They don't even care about the people in their own country unless their Rich-White-Elitist who puff their own shit and view everyone from the middle-class to lower as 'Bellow them,' this evidence is continuously backed up by the amount of Corperate/Wallstreet deregulation they do. Along with the unecessary and illegal warfare we've engaged in against other countries for nearly the last 17 years. All of the justifications being litteral American imperialism to basically just comming out and saying 'We're only there to take their resources,' having mixed how the Trump administration royally fucked us over in the beginning of getting off fossil fuels and the DNC now accepting Corporate PAC money as donation's to help raise their campaigne funds again to the New administration in Brazil now considering deforestation in the Amazon along with the genecide of an indiginous people who've lived there FOR YEARS! Along with numerous other actions that have the ability fuck over their people along with the WORLD much like the U.S...  And the worst part is all of point 1 doesn't cover the giant amount of shit that's going to lead to the Third Extinction...  The Humanist Report putts alot more detail in these news reports as well, I'd highly recommend everyone to check him out. In his most recent video he sums the jist of this really well, but basicly my generation along with all future ones will have to litterally deal with the consequences of the last generation's action's. Because let's face it, the people governing us right now, as well as the Fossil fuel companies that are at the end of their lives. They're not going to see the worst effects climate chang is gonna have to offer in the next 50 or even 20 years! So, much akin to the Conservative character Natalie played in this video, they're living up the height of their lives whereas people like me or any future generation are not going to get that chance since, by that point, we could litterally be living in a post-apocolyptic world when they are dead and gone. Now explain to me, how's that fair?  I see everyone blissfully unaware of the potential hellish future they might live in the next 20 YEARS!!!!!! And the worst part is they got to live!!!!!! What about me?!?!?!?!?!?! This is why I've come to hate people in general. They're, by definition, stupid. Sure, we could band together, have an 'Earth Strike' as people are calling it. We could put public pressure on politicians and demand change to renewable sources of energy... But think about this, people have shown us time and time again they don't give a shit about us unless it raises their profits and even then the reason why this is the hill they're willing to die on is because they know if they give in their businesses will be shut down. They have lobbying firms, Far-Right media, Corporate Reps, and millions of jobs and advertisements behind them continuing to spread misinformation. Do you really think we could beat all of that with the amount of time we have left? 12 years. 12 years to change or we die.  We're going to need Radical change if that's the case to save the Earth. I'm talking an armed Revolution here. A Coup. And not everyone's on board with that idea and some of those who are, might think to use it for personal gain via the MIC aka the War Economy. So I'm not optimistic we'll come together or make any real change fast enough to divert a humanitarian/environmental crises by the likes of which we've never seen.  As much as I like your videos Natalie, the alternatives aren't very realistic and these are the kinds of things that only the Governments of countries have the power to do. However, they refuse to take action due to intereferance with Corporate financial interest. I hope the world proves me wrong. I hope we break this cycle of insanity that has plagued us through history... That we could live in a world that makes sense... But we don't. The world can only make sense if you force it to. People can only learn through pain. So naturally I say, we give it to them.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Not that I care too much about South Park getting any credit, considering how much damage their nihilistic faux-centrist libertarian bullshit has caused, but... I reluctantly admit I find it funny sometimes, and two of the more recent episodes from this past month ('Time to Get Cereal' and 'Nobody Got Cereal?') actually rehabilitated Al Gore, admitted ManBearPig is real, and essentially admitted that they were totally wrong. It was as close to an apology as one could possibly ask for from Matt and Trey. Unfortunately it still ended on a cynical note, but that's South Park. Anyway I'd recommend anyone who can stomach/possibly enjoy the show to watch those two episodes, if all you've seen is the old original Manbearpig episode.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Fossil fuels drive 85% of energy generation. Most alternatives we have access to are dependent or in some way derivative of fossil fuel energy. We are 15 years too late to avoid drastic economic impact once effects are felt. Any reduction now or in the future simply decreases the severity of the events, even complete cessation of emissions.  The inconvenient truth is that a cool several fucking billion of us were only even born because of fossil fuels. Any technologies we develop will require substantial emissions to facilitate a transition to a more sustainable model at the current scale. Almost no aspect of the modern world is possible without large amounts of energy for production, operation, or both.  The suggestions you gave would certainly reduce your emissions, but at this point the goal should absolutely not be to reduce. It should be to CEASE IMMEDIATELY. Not to mention many of those suggestions still require substantial dependence on fossil fuels. And without a literally god like miracle the only realistic way to do that is to become unilaterally more poor and give up a set of luxuries we were only granted from fossil fuels.  People say time is money but that's bullshit. Energy is money and we live in a world with an obvious addiction and limited understanding of high school level physics and science. The situation is actually quite a bit more grim than this video let's on. Good one as always tho.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i took an ounce of issue with this video when you mentioned that 71% of emissions are caused by 100 companies and then went on to say 'you need to be a vegan with a prius' which i know was exaggeration and only one point but also a very small part of this. industrialism is the biggest problem, and little to nothing is done to help. i can vote in people who will fight this, but my side can also (and frequently will also) lose. the best thing we can do is educate. start teaching this shit in schools from an early age so that we have a more aware society which is less easily tricked by basic deceit and which is more willing to think about how their decisions affect the world around them before bad decisions become lifestyle choice and habit.  also, a valid point was made by your gorgeous lingerie-covered tub self: it's not feasible for many to do a lot of the things that would help. i live in a relatively large area (metro area is around 500 thousand people), but everything is so spread out that there's little public transportation. i have a $6K used car that i'm paying off which i use to drive 20-25 minutes to and from work five days a week. the only other option would be to carpool, which is difficult because everything is spread out here and the coworkers i like enough to sit in a car with for 20+ minutes live way out of the way. i'm not justify my own inaction but presenting that we need to restructure in a way that makes action more viable for more people.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hey! Longtime viewer, first time commenter.   Your video made me tremble in fear -- like litarally, physically shake  --  during the most dire parts. I get these shakes when I read or hear particularly devastating stuff about climate change, which is my absolute gravest concern. It worries me to the point where it's my main source of depression and anxiety.  The severity of the subject has compelled me to try and understand the world as best as possible. If we understand it, then maybe, hopefully, we can change it. I've read almost sixty books so far this year, among them 'This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate' by Naomi Klein and 'The Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming' by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway (I recommend these books). I've also read books on philosophy, politics, neoliberalism, propaganda and fascism. I read heavy stuff, and it's downright masochistic at times. I think you have to be a masochist to keep my reading habits up for long.  My greatest ambition in life is to become a writer and tackle the topics of climate change and fascism -- because I think the latter will flourish under the former. (My greatest areas of interest are climate change and fascism. Yup, I'm great at parties.) But ambition often feels like a burden, and so I start doubting my talents, becoming afraid that I won't do my grand visions justice. As someone who's been a struggling writer yourself, you can relate, right?   Your video was exactly what I needed. I'll doubtless rewatch it many times, like I've done with all your videos (yes, even the ones you don't want me to see anymore. Sorry, baby, I can't help it! They're too good!) Along with depressing books, your channel has aided me greatly in my valiant effort to understand the world, and I'm really only writing this long-ass comment to thank you.   Thank you for your thought-provoking and hilarious videos. You tell bitter truths about the direst of topics, with wit. That's a gift, a gift I envy and aspire to attain myself. You're an inspiration and a motivational force. Thank you.  PS: I loved the use of the reptile iconography at the end. 'The reptiles' need not be like anything out of a conspiracy theory. A reptile may more broadly be understood as anyone who succumbs to an ideology where they just ignore climate change. They may know climate change is real, they may know their habits only worsens it, they may know who's ultimately responsible, but they just ignore the problem altogether because 'Feels good, man.' They succumb to the sweet, numbing and nihilistic ideology of hedonistic consumption (which I guess you could also call fucking neoliberalism!) 'The reptiles' are merely people who've reverted to their reptile brain in this most deplorable fashion.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Speaking of general strikes- this last Friday, tens of thousands of Australian School kids had a climate strike- they refused to go, or walked out of school, and held demonstrations all over the country. This was organised by the school kids themselves.   Proud to say my daughter was one of the strikers. So there are some that care.   Also, Australian politicians are just as bad- they're celebrating the opening of another new coal mine (even calling it- a massive Indian mining corporation, a 'little Aussie battler' ). That coal mine is being given all the free water they want (in an arid country!), are being given a 'royalties holiday- so they are basically being paid to take our resources, instead of paying us for them, and are right next to, and shipping the coal out directly through the Great Barrier Reef- you know, just the largest reef in the world, the one that dying in front of our eyes- not to mention, the reef that supports 70,000 tourism jobs. But sure, risking all of that for maybe 40 temporary local jobs is totally worth it.   Our government is also pushing for more coal fired power stations- even though they are already more expensive than renewable alternatives. Gee, wonder if that has anything to do with the massive donations, and revolving door of pollies- mining company lobbyists? Our current minister for the environment literally used to work for a mining company. A former resources minister now works for the offical mining lobby.   It's all so corrupt and fucked up. They don't care that they're killing humanity's future. They care about getting more money now- fuck the kids and grandkids!   But- that school strike was pretty awes me, even if the pollies' response to it was atrocious: literally, stay in school and we should teach you about they joys of mining and fracking.

"I just wanted to clarify one quick point that's made in this video because it's often brought up in discussions on other political topics but 'cost' of a food can be measured in 2 ways, the actual average price per pound (or whatever unit of measurement you wish) OR caloric cost. This is why in discussions of food deserts and the importance of preserving corner stores in the wake of gentrification cheap McDonald hamburgers and the like are brought up. Because even if the ingredients to roasted eggplant or salad are more affordable over say a months worth of budget than something akin to McDonald's everynight, McDonald's, meat of all qualities, and animal products (milk cheese egg) are MUCH cheaper calorically. This is often overlooked because of discussions of calorie control and dieting, but a lot of lower class work still requires calorie intake, and often may require a higher calorie intake than higher paid working positions (ignoring lifestyles outside of the workspace, I'm talking bare minimum here) due to the requirement to work longer hours, do heavy lifting, staying on your feet, etc. And while something like McDonald's r whatever doesn't have high nutritional value, our bodies are MUCH more reliant on calories than proper vitamins to function properly/at all, and is one of the reasons Veganisn is NOT widely recommended as a suitable or even viable lifestyle change to help content global warming (as opposed to vegetarianism which IS widely recommended) since non meat animal products like dairy and eggs contain more calories than many conventional vegan options (this is actually WHY we have dairy at all, because Northern Europeans needed to cultivate a source of high high caloric food during the cold winters, and had to develop/evolve lactose tolerance past adolescence. This is also why caucasians have the lowest rates of lactose intolerance, since the gene isn't inherit to humans as a whole and originated in Northern Europe, with the descendants in modern day carrying on the same genetic coding no matter their actual home tempature or calorie needs)  Really loved the video, as a nuclear physics undergrad the future of energy consumption and distribution is intergrak to my studies and I just thought I'd share some context for others  to an offhand comment that tends to pop up in other political and apolitical discussions not directly related to climate change.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"1. Yea shit's looking REALLY BAD. 2. Hey, at least China's going to save us....  Ok, maybe I should go ahead and expand upon this point a bit more. Hopefully, everyone is aware of the 35 BILLION (yes with a B) US DOLLARS China is putting into green infrastructure. Not just in China, but developing nations?  Why is China doing this? To become the next world super power. In a few short years, thanks to green infrastructure in underdeveloped countries that were dominated by the US and Saudi's to keep underdeveloped for easier raping, these countries will no longer be beholden to either religion (Saudi's construction of Muslim universities or the US demanding abstinence only education, just as two examples) or to the enslavement of its people (on going civil wars for easier access to materials or slave state jobs, just as examples). Once these countries are producing eco friendly products and have higher educational standards, China will have MASSIVE trade partners unlike anything before in history.  So that's it, right? Not by a long shot. This is the reason I am not worried about North Korea. In short, China knows where it is about to be in relation to the rest of the world (as THE superpower). They are smart enough to realize that in order to be a world superpower, they need a world to be a superpower of. China is already enacting stringent environmental regulations. I have a theory though. With China dumping this money in green infrastructure and technology, they are actively researching ways of not just fighting global warming, but actively reversing it. They have already made great strides elsewhere with science (genetically modified twins? Fuck yea, I'm in). So, I would say it's not too far fetched to believe they have some kind of plan.  So let's say I am right. China is about to end global warming within however long, no more worries, right? WHAT THE HELL? HOW IN THE NAME OF OUR EVERLOVING FAVORITE KERMIT IMPRESSIONIST DID YOU EVER COME TO THAT CONCLUSION? Even if this does happen, it means very little if we do not slow global warming to a point were it is reversible. Let's say it doesn't matter and China can reverse it anyway, well, I don't know about you but I still don't like China. I don't really like any power actually. Any superpower is inherently evil. The US will just drag behind unless we enact our own green new deal. Not that I'm in favor of the US just creating a new status quo with a green new deal, but holy shit, we still need to be careful. Even if I'm right, that doesn't mean we won't be open to new threats and challenges. Sustainability for humanity IS a huge problem that green resources will help fix (feeding a few more billion people? Easier done when the crop takes less then something like a hundredth of current crops... yes I'm talking about crickets, get over it). We still have a lot to work for and to fight for. I would also never admit this or say it to a skeptic, but....  We can point out that China is about to become an economic powerhouse because of their green new deal. Maybe we can use the right's open xenophobia to coerce them to help with a green new deal of our own because I'm pretty sure the right really doesn't like China.  Either that or I'm just crazy. I mean I have several really bad mental illnesses... but you get what I mean.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm glad you addressed animal agriculture in this. The most common estimate I've seen is 18% of GHG emissions, just on meat, dairy and eggs (that's more than the entirety of transport; private, public and commercial). While radical change is necessary, we can't demand change to the industries while still demanding the damaging products and services they provide us, blaming the system is just another way to avoid responsibility and do nothing.  I'm also glad you addressed the 'soy gives you moobs/turns you into a woman' (wouldn't that make it easy). The only study supporting that included wildly unrealistic amounts of soy, and was supported by the dairy industry, while more impartial studies suggest that as phytoestrogen is the same shape but has a completely different chemical makeup, it actually blocks estrogen receptors reducing the risk of hormone-related cancers (and moobs).

Their brains are so ingrained in how the system works that they can't imagine any other way of doing things even if they wanted to. I live in one of the most liberal countries on Earth, we're so progressive that led lights are already mandatory, other light bulbs became illegal years ago. And we have more electric cars per capita than any other nation, soon they'll be mandatory too. Our politicians are always talking about things that need to be done to clean up, even though we're already leading in renewable energy and innovative new green solutions. Guess how we fund all that progress? Oil, lots and lots of oil. Our awesome /s politicians recently expanded oil drilling in the north sea and proclaimed we'd have a steady income from oil for at least a few more decades. Yay Norway. A population so racists we elected a right wing government as soon as they mentioned immigration, despite knowing what the right wing actually is, we did it before Trump made it cool even. Of course nobody here would admit to themselves that they're racists, because everyone here has a Jesus complex and think Norway can do no wrong. So we're all sitting here on our cloud looking down at the stupid primitive polluters and Trumpists and Muslims, sorting our own trash and feeling all good about ourselves while buying a designer salt shaker for $200. Never even once worrying about all that oil being pumped into the global market through massive pipes spanning the planet, while at the same time nobody can figure out how to get water to places that suffer from drought.

I may indirectly cue them to become defensive just by me stating that I'm a vegetarian (I humbly submit, an imperfect one--after 29 years of eating meat every day it's quite hard to quit all at once), even though I explicitly state that I have no issue with them eating meat, that they can eat meat in front of me, and that I don't judge them for it (only one can judge oneself).

"I disagree with the statement that capitalism is all about short term profits. I think there is a cultural issue that seeps into business in the United States' mixed market, and that the engineers and entrepreneurs who have long term goals are more lacking. I mostly believe it to be social programs against businesses that cause these issues. Bailouts, special taxes, regulations, and unions will not allow the companies to die, nor make the profits to expand, and forces them to keep and maintain a staff of incompetent workers, and, in many cases, ban and restrict new and efficient technologies (as a skilled laborer, I've seen this myself), while companies no longer have to worry about ethical profits, so long as they side with the right politicians, like Inhofe or Hillary (yes, they're all in it).

It often brings attention to subjects that a lot of TV ignores or is unwilling to touch, while doing so in a way that is easy to digest and palatable to people who may otherwise shun many of the concepts that it covers.   Equally their recent game 'South park Fractured but whole', is quite excellent. With some really nice progressive and innovative touches.

"Sorry, but this existential crisis requires drastic and immediate action. Continuing to fall for the good cop/bad cop routine and settling for the lesser-of-two-evils Democrats isn't going to cut it. They're every bit as beholden to fossil fuel interests as the Republicans are, and are constantly touting the wonders of 'clean' coal and 'clean' natural gas.  Simply voting Trump out of office won't change a damn thing; he's a symptom of a larger, systemic problem, not a progenitor of the any of the calamities we're facing. Nothing would be different with a Hillary Clinton in the White House; she's actually to the right of Trump on many key issues. Instead of being outraged by the same damn actions Trump is taking, the establishment would be making endless excuses for her, telling us how oh so pragmatic her preservation of the status quo is.  I'm a good deal older than most here, and have been hearing for decades that we need to hold our nose and vote Democratic, that they'll somehow magically turn left one day, becoming the party of FDR again. Being able to take the left's vote for granted has instead given them license to push further to the right every year, so that they're now more conservative than the Republicans were under Reagan, while the Republicans today are full blown fascist.   Trusting that the slightly less evil half of the corrupt duopoly is going to save is catastrophically naive. We needed to start investing in a viable option outside of the this back-stabbing, hopelessly corrupt, unsalvageable institution decades ago. We're way behind schedule, and putting it off further will only lead to a more disastrous future for those who come after us. The problems we face require long term thinking and planning. Fantasizing that the Democrats, at long last, this time for reals, are going to so what's needed if only we get them back in the majority and in the Oval Office, is criminally irresponsible.  It would be a repeat of 2009-2016...swept into office with a crushing majority on a progressive platform, with a mandate to enact radical reform, the Democrats shafted us again and adopted and expanded most of Bush's worse policies, pretending that the mean old Republicans made them do it. The filibuster isn't a magic bullet that instantly kills any bill; it, at most, delays legislation from being voted on for a bit. Please, apologists, stop invoking that tired excuse for Democratic malfeasance, for their lack of effort to deliver what they promised. Putting them back in office will only result in exactly what we saw under Obama: absolute capitulation and subservience to moneyed interests, while insisting they can pragmatically do nothing else. We're supposed to pretend that Republican policies are somehow more palatable when served up by those with a (D) next to their name.  We need a mass exodus of liberals from the corrupt duopoly NOW. The Democrats need to be replaced; taking them over is pure folly, as it's been clear for decades that corporate interests have a complete stranglehold on the party. Jesus Christ, the incompetent Pelosi is going to be Speaker of the House yet again, and she's already pledging 'bipartisanship' instead of actual resistance. IF the Democrats were to reform, it would only come after enough people stop pledging their vote no matter what. They need pressure from their left. Seeing their historical base being pilfered might finally urge them to action. But if you swear fealty to them, they'll know they can give you nothing in return. Absolutely nothing is what you'll continue to get. They'll keep moving to the right, because YOU assured them you'll bend over and take it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Neuromorphic computing can greatly reduce energy costs of computation.

People do not want to change, they do not want to take responsibility for anything, and they most definitely do not want to do it because somebody else is telling them to. It is why people are quick to blame 'out groups', which the video touches on but doesn't connect the two concepts for some reason, and ultimately, there probably isn't any way to overcome it.

"A nice little detail in this great video I'd like to point out is that it doesn't buy into the mainstream narrative that humans and the environment have different interests and that we'll just have to make some individual decisions if we want to save the planet. The way liberal environmentalists approach this topic infuriates me. Personally, I manage to avoid using cars or buying overpackaged things for the most part, but many people do not, and guilt-tripping them is only going to - if anything - make them more hostile towards environmental activism. I don't think we should blame people who don't manage to meet some upper middle-class standard of environment-friendly consumption (putting the ways in which this type of consumption is still very harmful to the environment aside), but instead seek to overthrow the system that creates these problems in the first place. In the case of plastic waste, for example, the completely irrational state of commodity production is largely responsible for the horrific news (such as a literal Europe-sized plastic island in the Atlantic Ocean) in recent months. That doesn't mean resisting the whole thing in the short-term is impossible, but it'll only get you so far. We'll have to fight for broader systemic changes, and - as Natalie accurately put it near the end of the video - economic action (general strikes, for example) is highly effective in achieving great changes within capitalism and ultimately smashing the capitalist, profit-oriented framework itself. The environment and the masses ultimately have a common interest in overthrowing capitalism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Such a good video. Also a coincidence because I've basically been doing nothing but reading into climate issues for the past month.

I do go out of my way to not eat meat though if it can be helped but it won't be enough. Everyday has just felt like a ticking time bomb since I read the news about the IPCC report in October.

"+ContraPoints  Hey y'all, hi Natalie. I'm one of the people over at EarthStrike, I was hoping to add a little bit to this video.  So first of all there is one bit of crucial misinformation in this video concerning the emissions of companies. In reality it's 71% of global INDUSTRIAL emissions that stem from 100 producers, not companies but also for example government it self. Now those direct emissions are a smaller fragment of the global total one has to consider the part companies like Exxon play in this by not only adding directly into the pool of emissions but also fueling factors like transportation, other industry and energy production. Which is why it is important to both understand that we need to change our own behavior but also act politically in order to quickly change not just the landscape on and individual level but also on an industrial level. Attacking the problem on both sides. Contra already makes some good points on what you can do *individually* to help change the world, I'm here to tell you a bit about 3 things you can do politically.  3 Things that are not even that hard. First, take a look at platforms like ours over at earth-strike.com, our friends over at Extinction Rebellion or any other local organizations. Spread awareness by tweeting and sharing, make a meme if that's what you feel like, i mean political memes are lame as hell but if this is gonna go down we might as well laugh a bit right? Talk to your friends, your union or fellow students and workers. Word of mouth is always appreciated! Second, go to a protest. The folks over at Extinctions Rebellion specialize at that and we can highly recommend them. I get it, ugh going out, ugh peope. But just being there helps build up a presence, it shows politicians that we will not sit idly and let our planet die. And finally, Strike! This is where we at #EarthStrike come in, we're organizing a global general strike on the 27th of September to push for stricter government action to *not have our planet die*. You'd think it'd be less controversial but here we are. Yes this is the hardest part but come on, isn't it a bit exciting too?~  Anyway, thanks for the nod and wink, I really hope this video gets us somewhere. :)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The American political focus of this video actually obscures the larger political problem of climate change. The problem isn't even that there are climate change deniers, the problem is that the political and economical systems that the western world uses are entirely incapable of handling the societal changes that are required to adapt to climate change.   In Sweden, for example, where I live, there is not a single climate change denier in the large political parties. Still, almost nothing significant is done towards decreasing emissions and the few changes that have been proposed are heavily debated when they should have been implemented years ago. The bottle neck for serious action against climate change is actually not denial, it is the entire modern democratic political system and the way it interacts with capitalistic interests. It would have been more interesting if the video had dealt with this much more complex problem.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The funny thing is, in terms of the grand scale of the history of the earth, caring about climate change is a very self-preserving, human centered thing to do. If humans choose to fuck ourselves, the earth will go on. Plants and aglae will eventually use up the carbon dioxide and new species will evolve from the survivors. There have been mass extinctions before, and life has always found a way to survive it. In fact, on a geological time scale life has almost wiped itself out several times, for example, when bacteria evolved photosynthesis the increased oxygen almost killed all life on earth. When politicians say shit like 'Well, the earth has been very hot or very cold before,' they're taking a really weird, geological-time scale way of thinking, which has no relevance to human lives. They act like people concerned about climate change are concerned about the survival of literally the earth as a planet. We're not. We're talking about the survival of our species. We can care about other animals sure, but ultimately that's what it boils down to.  When they make that arguement, they're actually right, the earth would survive another mass extinction. But we most likely wouldn't. And certainly our way of life will all the champagne and delicious barbeque wouldn't.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thank you for making this. I feel saddened that the corporate media downplays the issue of climate change and amplifies culture war issues that have no impact on their sponsors. Even people with 'scientific' backgrounds like Sam Harris continually decline to talk about how severely we'll be impacted by it and instead garble on about the marketplace of free ideas. It's 100% the most important issue of our time, yet even all of the youth activism is directed towards gender and identity issues. People say, 'Well we can have more than one conversation,'  But then why are people of colour so insistant that whites share their platform if there wasn't an obvious monolithic discourse?   Maybe we have to look at climate change through a feminist lens, or attach a working class / bourgeois narrative before people in our own circles will start paying attention, and then attach an economic catastrophe narrative for people on the right. I'm in a state where we've had the worst Bushfires and heatwave we've ever seen on record, and a tropical Cyclone Owen looming on the horizon, and yet in all the news coverage about firefighters and evacuations, heat waves and dying flying foxes, not a single mention of climate change in the media at all - but they will pivot to a segment talking about how many female panelists there are on the ABC.

"I don't understand why denying climate change became a 'conservative' opinion in the first place   I mean I get why (muh carbon taxes limiting muh freedoms, muh fossil fuel industry jobs etc). But it's literally the fate of human civilisation at stake.   Conservatives are motivated by protecting the way of life  in their countries but don't stop to consider the opinions of experts who say ALL ways of life will end if we don't make changes to how we treat the environment   Where do they get the confidence to stand in the face of every single climate scientist and bet the future of their countries - the thing they alleged care about most - along with the rest of the planet?

"Well, to be fair, an inconvenient truth was mostly 'I, AL GORE, VICE PRESIDENT, say...', while the Inconvenient Sequel consisted of 'as I, AL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT said the last time...' Still, he has a point. But, the way he presented the whole problem was really... let's say... problematic. The part that really did it for me was in the sequel when he, the awesome guy he is, great man, AL GORE, consoled a crying dude who lost everything in a flood. I see how one could use this to emotionally rattle people, bit the way it was framed, it appeared to be mostly about Al Gore being a great guy. So, in conclusion, I agree with the point made, but I personally dislike talking about Al Gore's Documentaries because of the way they present the topic versus the way the present the person, seemingly (intentional or not) using climate change to stress his being a good (great (awesome)) person.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Thank you. The conservative worldview was never meant to last forever. It was a survival mechanism that worked much better when the world had far fewer people and surviving the coming winter was a constant concern. For millennia the tough minded heartless warrior was an ideal archetype for survival. By their constant warfare and stealing from each other they eventually thoroughly mixed the human stew. And when humanity began to multiply in a huge way conservatism became obsolete.  But just because it became obsolete it did not quit. For a little while it looked like there was time for conservatism to simply fade away but that didn't last long.  Conservatism was given one last chance to dominate humanity forever when we learned that billions of people and the industries that support them are heating the earth. This is actually great news for many of conservatives because they can make it fit their religious prophecies. To them it's not man heating the world, it's their god. Their god has always hated humans and having us boil in our own filth because we were too stupid to stop it would be a pretty creative way to kill us off.  The point is that to many conservatives climate change is good news and they won't do anything to help and will do everything they can to let it happen. It's in the Bible.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Ok, @ 22:40 the album cover for the Roxy Music album, 'Siren' immediately popped into my head.. Was that an influence, Natalie? You often seem to put so many music, film, art, and even literary references and/or easter eggs into your vids from past sub-cultural scenes that I love, but sometimes I think I'm just reading too far into the imagery. I swear it's a reference to that album, though. You can tell me I'm an idiot if I'm wrong... (also, I thought there was a Devine reference here too, but that one definitely won't surprise me)  Anyway, I FUCKING LOVE THIS!

"OK video but the call to activism was weak.  1. 'The science is still out' This was a line used by the tobacco companies for years and is being used by the oil companies now, remind people of that as often as you can. In order for 'the science to be out' there needs to be an active discussion on the issue in the scientific literature, there is not. It is just a delay tactic. 2. Climate change cannot be a wedge issue if it is then progress gets stalled/destroyed when a different administration takes power. 3. You better find a way for capitalism to solve this problem because if you have to fight both the large oil companies and capitalists rit large in America you are doomed to fail. Fortunately, capitalism can be used to solve this problem,  Oil and Gas will have to lose market share.

"The reason why conservatives reject climate change is because they see it as a way for the government to push SOCIALIZUM! and collect more taxes. As we all know, conservativesTM are in favor of least regulation. This is why now they're trying to regulate the internet and dictate what speech should and should not be allowed on private platforms, they want to regulate a woman's right to poke her vagina with a hanger, they want to regulate who you should be able to put an engagement ring on, they want to regulate what types of grass you're allowed to smoke, blah blah... I mean, the idea that conservatives aren't in favor of massive government is delusional. They constantly pass regulation trying to micromanage people's lives. If I was a conservative, I'd use climate change to begin developing new energy sources, remove fossil fuel dependency and that way I won't have to worry about taxation, and I'll be removing dependancy on the arabs.  But who am I fooling - it's lefties who invent everything. Then conservatives come and want to regulate the shit out of it. Just look at what's going on around social media right now - all of it is lefty invention, and it's been flooded by conservative parasites trying to use the government tell private businesses how they should run their business. But don't you DARE do the exact same about oil companies.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Global Warming as a term dates back no further than the 1990s... with Climate Change having been the official term prior to Global Warming.  Also... I'm not really able to do the Vegan diet as my body does not seem to function on it. I'm also the person who can eat bloody improperly cooked chicken and not get sick from it... somehow... I was really really thirsty for blood that day too--which I just assume is me being somewhat mentally unhinged. I try to not let my desires to consume blood interfere with normal human interaction--but this was a case where I managed to--not be sick for a few days like a bunch of people around me who ate the chicken seeing me eat it.  THAT being said--if we were to have people eat two servings of meat a day--it would be a huge REDUCTION to how much meat is being consumed. If you take out a deck of cards--put away your Legends Magic Deck--like a normal set of French Suit Poker Cards--that is how big a single serving of meat is. What kind of crazy person only eats two servings of meat in a day? Most sane reasonable people eat a years worth of meat in a single day--like rational people. So--if people who do enjoy meat, were to eat a reasonable amount of meat (hell, for a lot of people limiting it to five servings a day would drastically drop it)... we'd see some great improvements.  I will go vegan, if people start letting me have a tea made from vampire tea bags (yeah... I know--other less crazy people could prolly do it easier)... but... in my 'being slightly unhinged' I have to acknowledge that meat consumption is kind of over the edge and over the top. I mean... look at a deck of cards... think about when the last time you only ate two servings of meat in a single day was. Ask what that would look like ordering it at a fast food restaurant.  Also... Grolar Bears are a thing now because of Climate Change. Most people do not sit around going, 'okay... Grizzly Bears--but how could we make them more fearsome?'... but here we are... Grolar Bears are Grizzly Bears on even more fucking Meth than you would usually expect a Grizzly Bear to be on (which is a lot... Bears are crazy!).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I remember back ten years ago, when Al Gore got savaged for having a ritzy house while Bush Jr. had engineering students design him an eco-palace of the future.   When concerned mothers were trying to save the planet by unplugging their refrigerators and sending their husbands out in the family three-row SUV to buy ice every morning.  I remember....  I remember being just me with my average intellect and average high-school education trying to parse all the information about climate change I had access to on dial-up internet after pushing the sources through the, 'Do I respect this person?  Do they respect me?' filter.  All of the misinformation out there;  Some from people pursuing purely selfish agendas, some from people with the best of intentions but a lack of faith in the average person to be motivated without some 'finessing' of the facts, and some from people who just straight-up didn't know what they were talking about...  Because of all of this, ten years ago I knew... I... KNEW... that Climate Change was in fact.... not really a big deal.  Some dry areas would become wet, some wet areas would become dry, growing seasons would become longer and ocean-front property would move three inches closer to the beach; no big deal right?  But if you just couldn't bear cheaper strawberries year-round then stopping Climate Change would be as easy as KILLING SIX BILLION PEOPLE.  What?  You think that's too extreme?  How could you think that?  Don't you know Climate Change is a really big deal?  The atmosphere will thicken until it blocks almost all useable light while holding in all the warmth until the surface temperature rises to be able to melt lead, like on Venus!  Burn the land, Boil the Sea, and yes it will take the sky from Thee!    But don't panic, doooooon't panic.  We can stop this, we can.

"Hey Nat, love your videos this was great, thank you for talking about veganism. A few things though:  1.) The 100 companies argument sort of shadows the necessity of veganism and reduces the significance of individual choice. After all a lot of those companies will have roots in animal agriculture so the increase of individuals going vegan will undoubtedly have an affect on them, just look at how the dairy industry are suffering. Animal agriculture, livestock and their by products accounts for around 51% of all greenhouse gas emissions according to research from 2009-2015. So individual choice could have a great impact, it's more sustainable to change minds and perspectives through education rather than pushing for taxes on meat etc.  2.) Its great that you pointed out that that plant based meals are cheaper, it dismantles the fact that veganism is this bougie thing, but it's kinda disappointing that right off the bat of celebrating delicious meat based foods, in the vegan case you said 'you can eat lentils and sprouts'. Hearing this won't make veganism appealing to people, after all there's so many cheap and really good vegan food people can have and enjoy, ie pasta, fries, burritos, hummus and falafel, burgers, plus a lot of Asian and Indian food is already vegan or can be veganised.  3.) This is really pendantic but although you mentioned the dairy industry and eating less red meat, it probably would've been better to say them together and not as two separate things. Beef makes up the vast majority of red meat and causes the most environmentally impact of any animal, but I've known people who have stopped eating beef but then continue to consume dairy not making the connection. This is a problem, in my country of the UK 50% of our beef comes from spend dairy cows (the other 50% from calfs and male cows I think) and I imagine it's similar in the US. So essentially what this means is that the beef industry and the dairy industry are one in the same, leading to the raising of the same animals and ergo the same environmental impact. So talking about them separately when they're inextricably linked runs the risk of people limiting the consumption of one but not the other making no real difference, instead they are just receiving a different manifestation of the same environmental impact.

"'When all the world is overcharged with inhabitants, then the last remedy of all is war, which provideth for every man, by victory or death.' Dark times are ahead, if we do not go 'sustainable' soon. If people deny climate change, they surely must see that earth has limited resources, that fossil fuels will run out eventually, that .. sigh ..  Most people I know are well aware of the facts, including climate change, and the consequences, but the majority just doesn't care (Apres nous le deluge) or argues that countries out of the reach of their influence (India, China, US) produce so much pollution that positive changes in their private lifestyles (or even their entire home countries) won't make any difference, which is why they can just as well continue to live a 'good' = wasteful life. Tbh, I was about to give up myself, feeling that my years of arguing and protesting had no effect, but after seeing this vid, I think I'll manage to hang in there for a bit longer.

"Generally a good, informative video. One part I do have to complain about, though, is that starting at 19:45 . Not only are there 'capitalist' solutions to tackling global warming such as emission trading schemes or a carbon tax (not to mention that Margaret Thatcher, of all people, was one of the first leaders of any country to campaign to stop global warming), I also believe that such statements are harming the cause more than helping it: By asking for radical changes, you might be driving many more moderate right leaning away - even if they do solidly believe in global warming - towards the climate sceptic community. Such messages evoke the impression that the only alternative to climate change happening is letting 'crazy extremists' into power and some might rather fancy taking their chances with the former. Call me an optimist, but I do very much believe that there are many among the climate sceptic' or those opposed to environmental measures who - somewhere deep in their heart - do feel that climate change might be real and would be willing to support some efforts to stop it, should one show them that there are also less radical measures to help hinder global warming.  Violently objecting or denying it seems like a very natural first reaction  when someone claims there is a serious problem and completely giving up on their way of life is the only way to stop, but much less so if one offers more gradual reforms.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

What made you rise up was that you managed to try to handle the best talking points of the other side, say why they are wrong without demonizing them, and making self deprecating jokes about your own side. You clearly spend this entire video preaching to the choir, and trying to make demonize the people who disagree with you, and saying dumb shit like either we have to fix it or we get climate refugees. We could simply not let them in, and instead of talking that alternative also, you make it a dumb binary. You also say that people need to vote democrat in order to stop this, but economic destruction won't help much either. having a more richer economy could help us brace for this. Saying the choices are vote D or destroy the planet is just pure alienation and was unnecessary. Perhaps your transition is fucking with your ability to do the things you used to. Another point, technology is rapidly getting better far faster than the planet is getting worse.

I mean, the total abandonment of fossil fuels may affect the value of our currency. A drastic lifestyle change might throw our industry into chaos, and leave us weak to foreign influence. The right and the left need to have a realistic discussion on the logistics of environmentalism. The United States doesn't need to turn into a different kind of dystopia as a result of blindly following environmentalist figureheads, who are only educated in environmental science and not much else.

The main thing is the fact that you didn't villainize the corporations all that much. Well sure you said that they are responsible for the damage, but what you should do is to point us into direction of direct action not only against the climat change but against the cause of it which is the giant industry and bam you also have instantly a guy that nobody likes and who can work perfectly for the narrative and also deliver some much needed ancom agenda and this brings us to my second criticism of the video. Well i will give it to you the disfunction of capitalist system when it comes to fixing this problem was mentioned but what you should have done is double down on this and say that the only true solution to the problem is ending the existance of private companies in this sector once and for all, because realisticly that is the only way of dealing with climat change and some subtle reforms while still leaving it to the markets just wont do the job.

"'Just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of carbon emissions' This is completely misleading, because it's implying that consumers have nothing to do with these emissions, when they have *EVERYTHING* to do with them. Corporations don't cause CO2 emissions for fun, they do it to provide products - like gasoline for cars, fast fashion clothes, steaks, organic food etc. Sure, companies might sometimes choose slightly less efficient processes to provide the product,  but the *majority* of emissions are ultimately caused by consumers choices.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is something that I have never understood about conservatives; they seem to believe that it's basically a miracle that society hasn't fallen apart already because we're all rabid apes deep down inside, so we should change as little as possible. Apparently Jordan Peterson once said that if he were given the task of changing Canadian traffic laws he would study 8 hours a day for a decade before making the tiniest change, I guess lest the dragon of chaos infect our highways.   But that absolutely doesn't acknowledge that when societies have collapsed in the past it's been because of a a reluctance to change their traditions; look at Easter Island for a classic example, but there are many more out there.   Climate change is going to give us a lesson in this. Addressing increasing food insecurity, increasing climactic chaos, mass extinction of plants and animals and increasing numbers of refugees will require societal agility to a degree that many conservatives will be uncomfortable with. Maybe they'll genuinely want to address the problem but same thinking that got us into it won't get us out.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is a terrible strawman. As a major offender, you 'debunk' the no consensus argument with the 97% of climate scientists figure. Besides multiple of the authors of papers cited claiming their findings to have being misrepresented, the argument was that there's no consensus on future climate trends -which, as of right now, there isn't-, not on the anthropogenic nature of current climate trends. Another point was the argument of climate change having stopped, also 'debunked' in the website you linked; this argument actually never existed. What they may be trying to address is the fact that the rate of increase of global temperatures having stopped since the late 90s. While some Alex Jones types may make outrageous arguments, it is deeply irresponsible to take these as representatives of climate skepticism. This is equivalent to Ben Shapiro claiming that your birth genitals define your gender because transitioning doesn't change your biological sex, and it just so happens that Riley Dennis considers herself to be a female. Therefore, argument closed, he already debunked your arguments and you can make a video titled Ben Shapiro DESTROYS trans ideology.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've always thought that it's entirely fucked up that people are fully capable of believing that we can cause a global nuclear winter by dropping a couple dozen bombs one after another, but that 270 years of constant, increasingly intense industrial activity can't possibly have a similarly drastic effect on the climate.  I don't think that people understand the scale we humans operate on; we cause 10X more soil erosion than all other types of erosion combined, even including the efforts of Our Dark Mother, The Sea; all of the volcanoes in the world generate about 200 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually, while our automotive and industrial activities cause some 24 billion tons of CO2 emissions every year worldwide, etc etc.   We're a natural force. People making the argument that 'well, the climate changes in the past, it's a natural thing' seem to totally ignore that fact that it was the interaction of natural forces with one another that changed the climate, and that adding a new, fast-moving natural force into the mix will obviously change any system as complex as the world's ecosystem is.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

There isn't a point to telling people  about global warming because all the scary stuff isn't supposed to happen until 100 years from now and lets face it no cares about shit until it starts effecting them in the moment.  It's scary until you ask 'Hey when is this supposed to happen?' and the reply is '100 years from now!'. Personally I think theres really only three options to global warming. 1. We detonate neutron bombs above major cities  to depopulate.  2. Convince everyone that C02 and other green house gasses are pushing oxygen levels down global and everyone is going to suffocate in 20 years. 3.

Now lets trust at face value these same industries who have started/bought up as many 'green' solutions as the market will bear. And contribute heavily to political coffers. So hurry up and cough up that cash plebs 'cause your all to blame.

Companies that don't adapt to changes in the market *do go under*, it is not unheard of, capitalism isn't too big to fail... and from their ashes new companies arise to exploit the market. We just need to keep making sure to control our demand so that it doesn't support exploitation.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hi! With regards to a massive general strike, I noticed you were in contact with the #EarthStrike movement in preparation for this video. It's a promising new organization that has been endorsed by many prominent leftists including Noam Chomsky and David Graeber. We're only a few weeks old right now, and we're still trying to get off the ground and spread our reach. To this end, you've built up an impressive following among our primary target demographic - young, leftist, and online - and an official shoutout from you, maybe in the video description, would mean a great deal.  We're organizing three global protests for 2019, culminating in a general strike on September 27. Our mission statement, list of demands, and information about national and local campaigns can be found on our official website at URL","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Being more cereal why do we put our faith in corrupt bought and paid for political parasite? It DOSENT matter which side they don't represent the people they represent the corrupt federal reserve and the lobbying parties that are lining their pocket. They manipulate us in to hating one another for the fact if the American people came together there's nothing we couldn't do. That's the whole point of this political soap opera shit show that's now torn this nation apart! Why so they can continue putting us further in debt getting rich off of our ignorance and continuing the corrupt organization that fucked us back in the early 1900's called the federal reserve.

"There's something so beautiful about water. I can't really explain what causes that beauty. It has this almost otherworldly effect on me. When I start thinking about it I can't contain myself. My excitement bursts forth from within my innermost being. I guess this longing for water is something so primal that it transcends time itself. This longing for water must be coded into the very minutia of our DNA. It has been a part of us for longer than we know. Frankly, I believe this deep lust for it has been a part of us for longer than we've even had the idea of an 'us.' This lust for water exceeds even the seemingly endless bounds of conscious thought. From the beginning of life itself there has been one common factor in every species, the one thing that unifies all life. For this reason I believe water to be the essence of all things good about the human experience. Happiness, joy, love, hope, togetherness, peace, thought, time, progress, etc. All of these wonderful things are most perfectly found in water. Sometimes, when I am alone and yearning for the embrace of water, I cannot help but ponder the deep cold expanses of water that span most of this place we call home. Truly the sea is our dark mother, the origin of life as we know it. From the very first cell, water was there. This impossibly deep connection between water and the experience of life can lead to only one end, and that end is the realization that to be one with the water is to be one with life as a whole. The paramount experience of existence is to be enveloped by our dark mother, to feel the liquid in every curve and divot in my body, and frankly, as with every divot in my body, the water also fills every divot of my soul and my conscious mind. For this reason alone I believe that as humans, all of us must surrender ourselves to the inherent eroticism of the sea. We must become one with all life and sink into the embrace of the eternal bringer of life.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
