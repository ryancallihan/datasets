Juggalo culture is the purest form of American culture.
Off the "hook." Niice.
hoooo. the james bond scene was yikes.
8:28 Just sign a confession, Carl.
(re: rapey connery in goldfinger) clint eastwood in high plains drifter: "hold my beer"
This does get further complicated by the fact that a lot of women are into rapy sex. I'm sorry but it's true. People need to talk about all of it if everyone is going to understand exactly where and how consent is going to be ascertained. Like I would say to those women that are that it's the kinda fantasy sex that's best constrained to an established romantic relationship otherwise you are muddying the water for everybody else. Wtf do i know though I'm just some dude.
A NJ judge just let a teen rapist off because he comes from a good family. If he raped a girl he's not from a good family or having redeeming qualities. On this case I stand against rapist and rape is mala in se.
So Laphroaig Single Malt Scotch is not for everyone.  Those who develop a fondness for it are truly extraordinary.
In your lineup of suspects, you have darkmatter2525.  I like his stuff, but I haven't seen any pro-rapy content from him.
3:42 and fritz are the reason i love Contra
CP for chairperson of the would 🌹✊
Oh, and if MLK was around today. With him "cheating on his wife" (actually, he kept entire hotels stocked full of women. For the sole purpose of his sexual satisfaction). It wouldn't be Sargons loser ass that would have a problem with it. It would be us. Because that's what we do. We take great leaders, who we agree with 99.999999% of the issues, find one transgression and cancel their fucking ass. MLKjr couldn't exist today, on so many levels. Remember how the occupy movement refused to have any leaders? The right doesn't even care if their leaders molest children. We're so utterly fucked!!!
Okay now. I literally agree with this channel more then any other but to put Bill Maher, Richard Dawkins, AYAAN HIRSI FUCKING ALI!!! In the same category as Sargon of... whatever the fuck, is a travesty.   Without a doubt: the biggest flaw of the left is our collective, bigoted (not in the way you think) outdated, narrow minded views on Islam. Because if someone throws a gay person off a roof of a building it doesn't become hunky dory if a brown god tells a brown person to do it.
The only thing alcohol does is remove your inhibitions. When someone is drunk, it means they're showing what their true selves actually are without any social limiters holding them back. Alcohol does not change you, it only makes you more of the person you truly are and if that person is a rapist, then you're a rapist.
*ContraPoints:* I'm a man on the internet ... *me:* _spits out drink_
I don’t actually have to lock my door because I live in a decent area. It’s almost as if it’s the criminals that cause crime and not the lack of locks. So to avoid rape should we wear locks on our vaginas? Is that seriously the answer?
I was close to unsub few time but fak you are ze god ze humor is marvelous
was playing pokemon red when i clicked on the vid
I didn't know about that genital mutilation in those countries, especially that it's so spread. It's so disgusting and depressing.  Although I knew about male genital mutilation before, and that's too disgusting and depressing.
Torture rapists
Do I call you Natalie in these old vids? I really like the way you argue. Yes both the aesthetic of your media and the points you choose. Although my feelings still say rapists are monsters.
I can prove there's a rape culture in the west just based on the fact that prison rape jokes are so prevalent they make their way into children's cartoons, and that laws prevent men and even boys from legally being counted as rape victims, and that they're even told how lucky they are to have been raped.
<Rape music swells>
I remember those people, "Thunder"foot, The "Amazing" Atheist, etc etc. I remember getting into them a long time ago. Then they became just like the religious zealots I didn't like, even when I was into religion. So if I didn't like the religious zealots as a religious person, why in the world would I like zealotry within the atheist community, as a non religious person? Then they all got even worse. Now the youtube atheist community has been taken over by "intellectual dark web" incels, who regurgitate right-wing talking points.
"Off the hook"
6:00 I read in a book called "the gender games" that a woman was staying in a friend's apartment, that friend tried to rape her, he didn't see it as rape he thought he deserved it, so she ran away and went to another friends apartment, the same thing happened.
I have been drunk off my ass, aroused, and mad that a hot chick turned me down. I have seen said hot chick later that night drunk enough to maybe not remember what happened in the morning. That being said it has never occurred to me to rape said hot chick.
It's the Republic of Moldova not just Moldova. Moldova is a part of the country Romania and the Republic of Moldova is a country on its own.
Mozart heavy video, I love it~~
that james bond scene is TERRIFYING
Holy crap I've never seen the James Bond movies, that's horrible.  I also think that in older days women were raised that they had to say no because otherwise they were sluts, so you had to "make a man work for it".  Also I used to be of the mind that you don't do anything drunk you don't WANT to do sober, you're just more likely to do it, except then once I got HIGH and completely blacked out, luckily nothing happened to me because I was with good friends, but I wouldn't have even remembered if I had wanted it or not if I'd had sex.  I don't particularly party, so my idea of drum may have also been much different from others.  I used to occaisionally like to get a buzz from a few drinks to feel good and occaisionally I have a toke of a prescription MMJ because of severe pain, although I'm not a huge fan of the way I feel from port so it's pretty rare, but sometimes it does lead to some extra fun in the bedroom (I'm an old married lady now, but thankfully my husband is an amazing lover).    Sorry I got off track.  I think the main point of your video that you didn't quite say is that it isn't that we must teach people not to rape, but teach people that there are lots of ways that one can rape or be raped.  I think 99% of people would never ever dream of grabbing a stranger who is walking home in a secluded area and dragging them to the ground pressing a knife against their throat and raping them, and I think that's why in Brock Turner's case, there were very extreme opinions on both sides of that.  Sexual Assault is usually more coercion than violence and that is where many people think they are not doing anything wrong.  I think most people know drugging someone is wrong, and even think taking advantage of someone who got drunk on their own is wrong, but you made some excellent points.  I think instead of teaching people not to rape, teaching people what is rape would be better.  I mean if Brock Turner had been told touching an unconscious woman in a sexual way is sexual assault, maybe he would have seen that woman and thought differently about touching her.
youve definitely mentioned something that has been bugging me lately... im in my late twenties now, but when i was a teen i grew up in a VERY liberal environment. very atheist, very sex-positive, my parents were very trusting, letting me figure out stuff by myself and so on... nobody had any weird issues with sex in general... but the thing is, absolutely NOBODY ever talked to me about consent! i had to learn about it from tumblr bc it just never came up in any conversation. neither my parents, nor friends, nor sex-ed in school ever touched on this.  and as a teenager ive been in a bunch of situations where i wasnt wholly comfortable and where i might have said no and left if... idk... somebody had just sat me down at one point and said "look, dont do anything you dont wanna do. its completely fine to say no. most important thing is that youre comfortable, if it doesnt feel good, you dont have to it." just something simple, you know? but media was my only teacher in that regard and yeah... i learned all the wrong things...
Seems like its a taboo to educate cis men abput sexual maturity.  Idk if its a concept lol
Lol, yeah, you're the perfect person to teach men about consent, the same person who in 2010 was a drunk, bent-over man in a dress who vommited on a parking lot and was also filmed putting his crotch in the face of a woman who fondled his "happy parts" under the dress.  I lament all those poor people having to witness all those "sexual escapades" of yours in public. Real role model teaching people about consent and toxic masculinity.
For proof about how the whole "hide women in sober nun outfits is the only way" is bs well my school actually did something right and the first thing we learned in 8th grade sex Ed was concent and an accurate description of what it really it. While this could be because I've known them since kindergarten the people from my school are much more respectable than the people I've encountered from surrounding schools without the same education not out of how good of people they are but strictly out of what they've been taught.
so much of this conversation seems to center around semantics. it's kinda unfortunate not a lot of pragmatic level heads are involved in the conversation who actually try to communicate.   I do understand you're arguing that there is proof there is rape subculture in America here, but that's not always the position; also, there's a great degree of equivocation between sexual harassment and rape by activists who use hyperbole. That seems kinda problematic.
Please follow @tuxlovesyou of Baltimore on Twitter so I can DM you my nudez ;)
I’d PM you nudes but judging by how you say ‘I’m a man on the internet’ I think that request is obsolete by now
Rapists know they can use alcohol as their weapon to rape someone. That's why its imperative to punish rapists whether drinking was involved or not. They will use I was drunk as an excuse every time.
I miss your humor in your older videos!
11:20 this is so hard to watch
You have no idea how many times I’ve had to say no over and over and over.
Wow I love the progression of you throughout the years
The "Dentist" from Little Shop of Horrors moment with the Anita Sarkeesian shrine is the true highlight of this video. I bend the knee to my queen praying to our queen.
just started watching and am happy to see you are drinking Laphroaig, got it for my dad for father's dad and wasn't sure of it's quality but now i see it is of the highest caliber
It is so great to know that some people are still reading books and thinking critically about our society! Well done!
Contra You Are A Chapagne Socialist Not A Real One.
A big problem I see here is you seem to be taking the words of these rapists at face value. Of COURSE they're going to say "I wasn't trying to take advantage" and "I thought she wanted it too," but that doesn't mean they didn't actually KNOW they were doing something wrong.   These are excuses made after the fact to cover the actions that they know to be vile.
Guys,  we have a murder culture because sometimes the legal system fails to convict actual murders.  😂
There is no rape culture.  I'f u rape someone,  u will probably go to jail,  and you will certainly be unemployable for the rest of your life.
You have created a talent for intelligence and long but well constructed statements. May I compare you to the persistent whip-poor-will that sings all night.  It is an unwritten song with more meaning each time it is heard.  I am listening to it now as it sings at the bottom of the yard where the acoustics are just so ever right for its voice. Mind, though...I listened to you first. Smiling, George.
Rape is a deviant behavior.   It's not normalized nor acceptable.  You strawmanned the hell outta Sargon and Thunderfoot
James Bond also murders people and blows shit up.    We don't therefore have a homicidal arsonist culture
you make the most fascinating videos! can you please do a video on sam harris? I find him to be equally as nutty as 'daddy.'
moldova is not western society - someone who is from the country moldova used to be a part of
Forgive me sweet mother dark mother wtf. This channel cracks me up
I really loved how calm you were through the whole video and didn’t shy away from addressing good points made by the other side, but showing they didn’t tell the entire story.
BABY, I'M SORRY
12:00 So bc feminists had some good ideas 50 years ago we have to give the same credence to the most bat shit feminist hot takes we see today? Yeah sorry but rich white women that have to look for subjective intangible bullshit to prove sexism is alive and well today in mainstream society aren't good arbiters at deciding what's sexist or how our society functions.   Also it's really dishonest when feminists take credit for every decline in violence against women. Why did sexual assault go down since the 90s? Bc every other crime plummeted since the 90s.   And yes you kinda do deserve to be mocked when you claim that when two drunk college students have sex, the man should be charged with rape no matter what, which a lot of the goofy ass feminists you're doing damage control for genuinely believe.
6:20 Pretty sure he was saying something his lawyer told him ie not a good example of rapist psychology.
4:43 Those are all women in their 20s at the time (Lohan was 17, still legal).
I had to stop watching when you said "We fetishize youth." Are you retarded or do you not know what you are attracted to is genetically ingrained into you? People do not fetishize youth - what fucking animal do you know is primarily attracted to old members of its species? That's like the most maladaptive trait to have. You don't even need to have any study of biology to understand why that implication is so idiotic.
??? Darkmatter said nasty sh*t??? when?? whatthefcuk??? dude -------------------- He was like my atheist father :// is he really actually a douche??
I go with egalitarian because nobody jumps down my throat for it
1:22 Is that what I think it is?
Apparently there's a definite r*pe culture in US prisons...to the point that people talk about it like it's common knowledge and even joke about it though it's not funny - it's horrible and terrifying.  Apparently it happens to all kinds, not just women who dress cute or something.
Sargon: women actually aren't raped that often. They're lying  Also Sargon: you will NEVER end rape, rape will ALWAYS happen, deal with it
Nice guitaring.  Have you ever used a treble boost?
amazing video. thank you. I love your work
Until victims are valued higher than the career of the rapist, particularly in court, rape culture is real.
4:45
I would swim through a lake full of water to make Ben Shapiro watch this video.
Sex is evil anyway. You cannot even truly WANT to fuck or be fucked, because that would turn you (a person) into a mere object. And that would defy reason itself. Just read Immanuel Kant's "Metaphysics of Morals"! It's a very compelling argument.  The only way to make sex morally acceptable is (according to Kant) a life-long contract between a man and a woman, to use each others genitals. (That's basically  his definition of marriage.) However, I'm highly sceptical of that loophole.  Just stop having sex! And stop masturbation, because that's evil as well!
I have told my nieces don't play the game where she says no but then giggles and continues bc it sends mixed messages and the boy is not likely to know when she really means no. Also don't get naked if you aren't dtf. However, with all that being said, you can stop at any time, say no at any point. I know that's confusing. Now add alcohol and hormones to the mix and not really knowing what to say or do. That's how rape can happen with one person not realizing they raped another.  With my nephews I tild them if she's not sober and/or she says No at any point then just walk away bc you don't want a misunderstanding to ruin your life
There's no 'rape culture' in the West.
Right it's only wrong when white men rape but brown and black men get a free rape pass because muh systemic racism.
"hands up if you have a lock on your front door" - it didn't keep my stepfather out.  it was his house.

ohh yes that zeppelin riff at the end <3
What was that about PMS? Seems extreme
Ugh that's a horrible scene. I've never seen that movie
omg I love ur channel
Have you ever seen A clockwork orange. My favorite rom-com
My usual response to people saying "I thought they wanted it" is just telling them "you (they) thought but didn't ask" but that isn't foolproof.
Consent is fucking hot
Who is your dark mother?
...Aaaand Sargon turned out to be a pedophile
Here's ContraPoints' video debunking your trashy worldview and calling you a shitlord: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJxEyWE0-cU
This still doesn't really prove that "rape culture" as defined by feminists is widespread in western society, nor is it a real defense of feminism. Feminism is a distinct ideology with accompanying literature and sociological backing. It's a beast of its own. Being an anti-feminist is like being against anarchism or libertarianism, just an ideological position.
You've convinced me that rape culture does not exist.
That Bond scene is actually pretty similar to.some Indiana Jones or Star Wars scenes... and, of course, that Bond scene might not get greenlit today, but "menninists" or even the average well-meaning person will defend "Revenge of the Nerds"
Steaming pile of bullshit
god damn watching these old videos is such a strange experience
I have a few friends who are Bond fans, and I thought I knew a fair bit about Bond via cultural osmosis, and never once has anyone told me he is a rapist. And yet here I am, watching him rape a lesbian. Fuck. Anyone who says "The West" doesn't have rape culture is either lying or ignorant
I have to disagree.  I think most women actually act hard to get so that the man becomes even more obsessed with them.  Most women want to be really wanted and lusted for and need men to lust for them. This is why consent is so controversial, a man asking a woman, "can I fuck you please," is like asking for permission to murder a cow before serving steak. Nobody will be ordering it anymore despite everyone wanting it.
1:41 You used a meme I made! How awesome! Not complaining, just pointing out that I made it. Here it is on Deviantart.  deviantart. com/mechaghostman2/art/Make-Atheism-Great-Again-614128190  Tbh, I'm a little embarrassed that I fell for all of that "but da SJW's" nonsense.
I feel rape culture in America is pretty much acceptable when it comes to prisons. But that’s also a bigger societal issue. Especially male prisons were people seem to want someone who goes to a horrible place like prison to be raped. Yet, we are fine with it.
Yea very few rapists admit being rapist, it's called rationalization... This doesn't mean they didn't know it was wrong, it only means they convinced themselves of that.
Contrapoints seems to be one of the few people on youtube that actually  uses a solid line of reasoning when discussing difficult sociological/philosophical issues.
I find it ironic that so many youtube "intellectuals" who spend their lives complaining about Christianity are also anti feminist, considering feminism is as anti christian as it gets. You'd think atheists would readily accept feminism if for no other reason than to prove that they are more accepting than their religious counterparts.
There are certainly rape subcultures within american society, but I think over all, america is not explicitly a rape culture. I agree that our obsession with youth and sexuality subconsciously creates excuses for rape in America.
older versions  of pokemon are like that. newer verisons have girl option.
Oh my gosh Contra drinks Laphraoig, I knew I liked you before but goddamn, that’s my kinda person champagne an peated scotch
Why are they still complaining about feminism when there's still alimony
This 90% statistic about Egypt is so exaggerated. I’m an Egyptian and from what I know there’s no way it’s that high. Most rural less educated Egyptians do it.
Goddamnit im not used to natalie's old voice anymore
What a whole lot of this comes down to is nobody is taught what "drinking responsibly" actually means. Until recently, people weren't generally taught that being drunk affects the ability to consent. People were taught or concluded that drinking is an effective way to change someone's opinion on consent. People who do change their minds when drunk, but aren't bothered by it, don't put consideration into this being a harmful thing for others, and even themselves. People aren't taught about how their own choices can be impacted, how you might not be able to realize what consent even counts as when you are also drunk.
I lost it at Juggalo culture. I'd keep forgetting that was a thing if a cousin and some old friends from HS weren't so hard into it.
I'm sorry I'm watching these Natalie but I love them
I think unless given the option to do something bad without consequence, then you don’t really know whether you are actually a good person, or just scared of the consequences. This is why good people can do bad things when they believe they can get away with it or that the positives out weigh the negatives in a way.  With this definition we aren’t good or bad people, we are victims of circumstances that think we passed the test despite never being tested. It’s like calling someone stupid for failing a subject you never even bothered to attempt
Sex ed in our country is completely failing everybody.
A vampire cannot enter your house without an invitation.  If we teach men and boys to think like vampires and expand the definition of houses for girls and women then the problem of rape could be solved without resorting to common sense.
But does a defendant claiming, in court, that they thought it was consensual really mean anything? Obviously they want to save their own skin, admitting to rape in a courtroom will do you no favours.
Take away: All of us will die before these questions are answered. No one is perfect. James bond was poisoned by feminism.  Finally, consult the darkness from your knees.
I’ve been watching a lot of your videos and they are very entertaining and I learn a lot but shame on you Contra for co-signing Joe Biden! Even 2-3 years ago it was obvious he was a creep 🙄
12:30 is that ShoeonHead at the far left? Really, because she is the most PC out of the whole group.
I often imagine if Bond was FAR more unattractive and not at all seductive, personality-wise... BUT! he is indeed still armed with his extreme persistence. And his persistence only. He will never stop physically persisting, until he gets what he wants. I feel like that helps to paint the questionable picture.
For those who say: "Why are feminists complaining about first-world problems when there's still female genital mutilation in Egypt?"  You don't get to complain at all! because there's starving kids in Africa who have it worse than you do. And I suppose by that reasoning, I don't get to complain about this... damn. But you also don't get to complain about me complaining! lol.
I like to pause the video at around the 1:14 or 1:15 mark.  I call dibs on the one all the way to the left.
Holy shit that Bond scene.
Oh boy you look gorgeous with lingerie and a guitar, i know now you are a girl, very looking good girl
man i love kid cudi
I WILL watch all your old videos...  There too good.  You can't stop me.
Y favorite part is “everyone pretends to be on your side all along”. I absolutely hate politicians!
I can taste the plinkett in this.
Caring about and respecting other people in any way, shape, or form is so *gay.*  Men are supposed to be uncaring assholes who don't feel love, pain, or sadness, and whose only duties are dominating others and providing for the family! (But not because you care about them. Don't be an idiot.)   Wanting to have autonomy? How did you get that idea into your *silly little head?* Women are supposed to be caring wimps who are loving, weak, and stupid, and whose only duties are being dominated and taking care of children! (And absolutely nothing else. Don't be ridiculous.)   Existing? How preposterous! There are only *2* genders!       - Sincerely, Western culture
I have to get this off my chest. I've seen the Facebook pages of people who bullied me HORRIBLY in school, and it makes me want to throw them out the window. Standing up for my friends in school bc (one bc he was gay, another a trans male) almost the entire school called them HORRIBLE names, and as a result of the sin of hanging out with them and being friends with them, I was immediately a target.   Being called trash was the most polite thing they said. I got called many homophobic slurs merely for sticking up for them, or anyone like them. I was already bullied for being poor, so so I was at a point where I just didn't GAF. Fast forward to my first time setting up FB, and I'm seeing all these people pretending that they were with gay and trans ppl all along, with their LGBTQ support messages and pictures - omg it made me want to throw up. I should have gone page by page and just outed them for the garbage human beings they were. I'm fine if they had a change of heart, that's fantastic, but to pretend that they were always like that, it's so much BS. It's infuriating! Even when I first moved out, I had to work in a fast food place starting out. Over of the same guys was TOTALLY FINE with our female boss having a girlfriend. Then when we dated for a short while, suddenly I was ok again. The absolute hypocrisy of that shit was so over the top, I wanted to move the hell out if that area, hell, out if the state. Lying jerks!!!!!😶😶
Nope, his new name is "Rapist, Brock Turner".
Your les paul is ugly
I believe this is partly due to the lack of sex education across the country, especially in red states where they teach abstinence only.  This whole situation is why I'm very cautious and almost scared of most men. Thank goodness I'm bisexual and I can stay away from being romantically involved with men for the rest of my life. Yes, I know, #NotAllMen but I've had enough horrible experiences that I've gotten to the point where I'm completely done with them.
Excellent taste in whisky
I was very surprised when you said Moldova. *Im* from Moldova. And I guess it could be called western society, yeah. Its funny you used a pic with some guys from Transnistria (which technically is part of Moldova, I guess. Its complicated xD)
Idk if I missed it in the video, but not only did we not discuss consent in sex ed in public school in Texas 15 years ago, they told us to not get raped by not getting raped. It was not implied it was our fault, it was literally stated. Even my ex-Mormon boyfriend was pretty horified by that. Apparently his ed was positively progressive in comparison.
Culture, in my opinion, so so bloody complicated to describe, but ridiculously easy to categorize. Historically, culture is described by three things: music, language, and food. Yes, location can affect culture but generally, if you change one of those three things listed, you have a different culture. If everyone on earth ate the same food, spoke the same language, and listened to the same style of music, there would be no definitive culture, just people living in different locations. The idea of rape culture is so fucking generalized that you can't use it in a society such as North-American Western culture. There are so many movements and counter movements that yes, it is unfortunately that so many rape victim's stories are questioned for their validity, but it doesn't help that when a man rubs shoulder with a women and accidentally pulls down the strap on her incredibly revealing tank-top, that he is then categorized as a rapist and suddenly, people on the centre assume that the validity of rape victim's stories is nonexistent.
Damn, watched it again. And I thank you again from bringing me back from the dangerous thought patterns I was getting into. By the way, your "in my time of dying" sounds spot on.
Narrator talks really fast. But very informative!!!!!!!!!!
"bAbY iM sOrRy" in the beginning is my fave lol
I would totally send you my nudes
so i can die eeeeaaasy
How fucking dare you put an always sunny clip in here.

Enlighten Us Socratessssssssssssssssss
Uuuuugggggghhhhhhhhh at James Bond 😣😣
Fucking NAILED IT!!
for the record the term rape culture was first used in a documentary on male prisons. in the uk women cannot commit rape. teacher fucks a 14 year old boy and everyone goes "oh where was that teacher when i was in school?" more men in the US are raped than women when you factor in the jails. could blame toxic masculinity but i could blame "toxic femininity" for the idea that female sexuality is so much more valuable than males and that only female rape should be focused on as far as putting a stop to it. heard plenty of women make the "dont drop the soap" joke.
13:35 2016: ‘I’m a man—’ 2019: ‘WROOOOOOONG!!’
I don't know, Chief. I'm going to have to say no to this one.
Warning might be a long read:  Tldr; raped in a closet for 10 hours and PTSD that follows       When I was 18 I was very Googly eyes over a sophomore when I was a freshman in college. He seemed sweet and caring. I also use to drink a whole lot I came from a very small town so this was like my first time away from a one stop light town. So yes I did drink and yes I did have sex (what a crime.) One evening I got extremely drunk at a Sigma Ep. House and the guy I had a crush on took me upstairs and I was like half awake on his couch. I overheard him talking to friends saying you know I have a sister and I would never ever allow a woman to be taken advantage of no matter how drunk or attractive. I hazed out thinking yes Im safe. Later on my roommates took me back to the dorm. I somehow got his number in my pocket and decided to text him a few days before my finals like he helped me and got me water and was a stand up guy good grades everything. He invited me over for studying. I of course was through the roof like how could he want to like help me study I am nothing but a drunk that like barely goes to class. He offered me cocaine and yeah I took a dab. Then he made me a drink in the other room. We started to kiss and like had honest like constently sex. I felt really dizzy and kind of sick and passed out. I awoke to being fingered I looked down at him and my body couldnt like move and I slipped off again. I woke up again to being raped in my ass I then could feel my limbs and tried to like stop him I got greeted by a very heavy blow to the head I am not 100 percent what I was hit with but it hurt. His queen bed was in his walk in closet. I knew that much because for everytime I woke up I could see a purple light from his bar where we were sitting out hours before. I awoke again to the feeling of pure coldness down there and like water almost? I was confused I felt pain and I heard him say look this is just to make sure I didnt get you pregnant. I felt a shot of pain and passed out. I woke up to a small beam of sunlight shining through the closet door. He was rolled over in the corner 9f the bed smiling. I look down to see my vagina basically cut to pieces and bleeding a good amount. I panicked but said quiet I opened the door I couldnt find my shoes and my shorts were cut to pieces also so I grabbed one spare shirt I saw and put it between my legs to stop the bleeding. I took a pair of sweatpants and a sigma hoodie. I walked down all 3 flight of stairs. When I reached the door by the steps there were brothers watching baseball one looked behind and looked at me as 8f he saw a ghost I had yet to look into a mirror. I get back to my dorm no one is there my phone is dead so I still dont know the time my final exam for soc202 was at 8 am. I get to the dorm and look in a mirror to see two black eyes and a busted lip and part of my ear was ripped. I plug in my phone and go to the dorm showers. For 15 minutes the water was red. A girl showering next to me said gross are you on your period. I just laughed because I couldnt really figure out what all happened or process it. I get back into my dorm and see the time 10:52 am. I missed my final and I'm still like 9n and off bleeding. I wrapped my wounds with a first aid kit since I could not to go the er with my parents insurance I didnt want them to worry nor did I understand that I was rsped because originally I only remembered the purple like and moving back and fourth. Later on I was kicked out of college by a panel of him and his closest sigma brothers. I didnt realize that i was raped until around 22 from then on i have gained flashed including smells, lighting, decor in the room, his breath, and other stuff. I'm 26 now and I did finally report it to the college last year but little can be done. The woman taking the account of thos event said every single detail matched up up to his bed being I  a closet and how it was a fire issue in 2011 and him and his brothers were told not to keep beds in closets. Even got the members names who kicked me out correct. The sad thing is being in a red state you only have 5 to 10 years to come forward and you have to have hard evidence. All I had were text messages saying come over, me texting a friend asking for a ride there, and a photo of my afterwords that I didnt even remember taking. PTSD is a bitch also recently my coworker said he was going to rape me because I'm so tiny and easy looking I snapped back and said no and lost my hon within a few weeks for disrespectful workplace because I told him to fuck off and not to speak to me like that. Isnt america great? Anywho if you read this more power to you never allow any one event ruin you I still love men and I still love humanity I just know what can happen if you allow yourself in dangerous situations you once thought were safe. There more details bit this is a YouTube comment the odds of someone reading a comment on a two year old wonderful contra video is small? Natalie words just made me want to share this. It can happen to anyone and yeah thank you Natalie for speaking about this topic I wish I wasnt so late to the contra party.   Www.patreon.com/spacesunknown
Oh shit, my university was mentioned in a ContraPoints video! ...Oh. (If anyone was wondering,  Phi Kappa Tau was banned from Georgia Tech for three years because of that email.)
I love you
Was that “in my time of dying” at the end?
In the end, I think you're being too negative on the channels that criticize feminism. They also have legitimate points (or, as you put it, "good ideas") that aren't going to fade away, and that are ultimately not that different from (maybe even the same as) the ideas that left-wing SJWs defend. Sargon... well, OK, I agree, Sargon is a lost cause. But in many of the other channels whose symbols you showed, there are good ideas. Truth is not served by reducing them to their worst ideas, as I believe you yourself tried to say.
I suppose part of the point in the James Bond rape scene is not the music playing, but the idea (which for the plot of that partciular story is true) that she wanted it and was refusing him for the wrong reasons. I think such situations can happen in real life: a woman may refuse sex that she actually does want for no good reason at all, or for "bad" reason (say, she thinks sex is bad; or, if you'd prefer something more evil, maybe she's a bigot), and that it would be good for her to change. The point, then, is defending the idea that raping her -- even in the off chance that this is what she really wants (it does happen, by the way, though much more rarely than old James Bond movies would have you believe) -- is not the right way to achieve such change; in fact, it might even strengthen whatever "wrong reason" she has for claiming not to want it.   In other words: even if she is saying "no" for the wrong reasons (and would love it if you forced her to say "yes"), forcing her is not a good idea. Unless you know exactly what her fantasies are, it's more likely to do harm than good.
Here's my problem with "of course they don't think they aren't trying to do evil, but still they do" theory. It's not, by the way, a problem with its truth value (just as the video doesn't have a problem with everybody accepting the truth value of the proposition "rape is wrong") -- it's the simplification that goes on behind it. Given that situations may vary, it is necessary to define the circumstances under which someone should not legitimately believe that what he is doing is being well received. If it is true that there are moments when the victim will "agree" (but not "consent"), then it must also be true that there are times in which the perpetrator legitimately thinks "everything is OK" and is legitimately surprised to realize it isn't. Not as a trick, not as the result of "rape culture", not as a way to fool himself -- but legitimely so, just as when you are surprised to find out that the package you just got from the mail does not contain the object you ordered via Amazon.    It may be an inescapable problem of trying to change something that one has to come to a more precise definition of when that something one is trying to change is actually the case. People aren't so simple that rapists can only (a) be evil or (b) be fooling themselves. There are other possibilities, too.   Or, to put it in a slightly darker way, I think the problem of rape is also linked to the problem of evil, which we haven't really solved yet.
...nuns get raped too.
Brock Turner is still a rapist and a monster.
I like your videos but this one is so far off the mark.....if there is a rape culture then it certainly is infantisimal compared to the drug culture
Great content, keep it up Natalie! I'm bisexual, but I don't date or sleep with women anymore; don't need the liability.  At university I moved exclusively to the D- no pregnancy scares either!
7:40 And why might a bunch of men be inclined toward sadomasochistic hazing rituals? Consider that nearly all parents "spank" children (i.e. hit the buttocks to cause pain) at some point, and that around 20% of adults in the landmark ACE Study reported experiencing physical abuse as children, while a similar number reported sexual abuse. Do we really think these early experiences don't adversely affect later behavior or attitudes toward bodily autonomy?
"It's not rape if romantic music plays in the background."
I actually had to skip over the bond screen once he gets on top of her. Never will I complain about "Annoying trigger warnings" again.
are we taking about hip hop culture, Appalachian culture...JUGGALO CULTURE!??   lmao idk that's do funny but it is.
" THE BLACCCCKS" lol
I fucking love this channel.
Could somebody help me find a video I saw about Don't drop the soap and men being raped in prison. I thought Innuendo Studies made it but I can't seem to find it on his channel  and I didn't save it to a play list the first time I saw it but I would like to watch again.
I'm not the only one that noticed pretty much every episode of SVU the victim was either also dead or was physically beaten to the point where they might die. They always wanted to make sure there was no nuance or any ability to really humanize any of the perpetrators because if they ever went into something that could be considered a gray area the show probably would have been pulled off the air for being too controversial.
Cool, now do islam.
I finally have something to thank HBO for, well, thanks for that. New subscriber here. Keep fighting the good fight!
Your garter-belt game is strong, AND you know what slide-guitar sounds like....we're GOOD.
Thank you for this video! Finally some balanced reasoning <3
I know no one is going to read this because this video was posted like three years ago, but the only rape culture I've experienced was in liberal academia. I am a straight white man who is in a fraternity. and I was molested as a child. the professor would bring up all these statistics about crimes against women, and I brought up statistics on male rape and she refused to believe me. eventually I told her why I was in such opposition to the idea that only men could be such monsters. that I a victim, could do this to another person made be nearly vomit every time I went to class. thankfully she changed her tune, but I wish I didn't have to bring up the most painful experience in my life. But even still  people who I took the class with still look at me like I hate women after everything I said in that class. I felt so lonely and confused about a lot of stuff, and so I tried to  go to group therapy for my trauma through the university, and they had a group that dealt with sex trauma but it was for non-male identified only. I have no one I can talk to, no resources, and a lot of problems.  Luckily for me I have my fraternity who I never was super happy about because they go to such lengths in the name of hedonism, but apart of me realizes that I should care about myself and love myself because literally no one else in my whole school does. That doesn't mean I'm giving up on social justice because I don't want what happened to me to happen to anyone I just wish i could have avoided being judged based on my Social Bonds, Gender and Race by those who supposedly champion the opposite!
MY BIRTH COUNTRY WAS MENTIONED IN A VIDEO WTF. Lol Moldova is such a shithole...
I have so many things to say but honestly it just seems pointless kinda like trying to explain why you feel like coming forward and trying to report rape would only succeed in destroying your own life and degrading and humiliating you further while you still lose the court case and accomplish nothing but prolonging your misery. "Well if your not lying press charges! Yeah thats what i thought..."
Damn. Was the Zeppelin outro to a video mentioning pedophilia apropos or what?
Dude I lost it when you mentioned “gay rapey hazing rituals”
"Iiiiiiiin my tyyyme... of dyin'....."
Wow, the guitar thing at the end was nice. Sometimes I wish I could do things properly.
You refuted yourself, really. You presented the evidence to conclude that there is no such thing as a rape culture in the west. The west is not a drug culture either. We are in fact opposed to those things. You can make the claim that a group of druggies have a drug culture and that a group of rapists have a rape culture, but western societies are neither. And this is *obvious*.
Meet me, Jesus, meet me  Oh meet me in the middle of the air  If my wings should fail me, Lord Oh please meet me with another pair  And what is the proper email address to send my glorious lewds?
Thanks for help me with my taxes. 2:36
It pissed me off that these people insist they are rational, free speech lovers but as soon as you disagree with them they go fucking bonkers and accuse you of being some man hating feminazi and threaten to rape you. Pot meet kettle!
Fellow Marylander! Great video Contra. Keep making the great content!
In fifty shades of grey the young woman used the safe word and he didn't stop. That was rape and women voted for it with their dollars. Their is a rape culture being manufactured by feminism to justify incresing the power feminism has in society. I understand that's an unpopular point and I am not claiming anything like feminism is solely responsible for rape but there are actions feminists could take that don't require trying to exercise power over men that seem to fall into a blind spot which brings the group's motives into question. Another unpopular statistic that you can look up for yourself is how many rapists were raised by single mothers. In the absence of possitive masculine role models young men will attempt to define masculinity for themselves making grave errors with massive consequences occasionally. If you are writting me off as a sexist to avoid these points you should know that lesbian couples are doing much better at not raising rapists.
Damn this is a good video
What's the name of the painting at 4:23 ?
Amizing I love this video thanks!
Your bias is showing...
Holy shit I'm a Phi Kappa Tau pledge and I never ever heard of that story. That's so fucking horrible Jesus christ.
You should play guitar in your newest videos
was there a red letter media reference thrown in there?
rape is an act. There is no rape culture we punish them. we dont reward them.
I don't know what rape culture is. I know what rape is and I know that some countries have more rape incidents than others. In my country, Saudi Arabia, rape is almost non existent and among the lowest along with others crimes in the world.
On the topic of female genital mutilation, male genital mutilation is incredibly prevalent in the United States.  It's an awful thing that nobody speaks about, and isn't about it being not as bad as female mutilation but a huge violation of consent.   "He only groped you and didn't rape you, boohoo." Both are awful and people need to work towards activism to prevent both... And it's a lot easier to change things in our own society as she said, so we should focus on ending male genital mutilation in the United States too.
Moldova isn't a Western country tho. 😂 Sincerely, a person from Moldova.
yea why does hope for a better future have to be looked down upon?
good way to put it, you have more influence on your own society
Afraid of Islam I see lmao, you guys don't give a shit about Islam, you simply do it because you're scared of retaliation. Make fun of Christians/ do a sin? Worst thing that could happen to you is a small protest outside your house, carrying a couple of signs with bible quotes Make fun of Islam/ do a sin? Charlie Hebdo, acid attacks, terror attacks.. etc etc Here's the thing about Islamic immigration, the reason why there isn't much in America is because there's an entire ocean between the US and the Middle East, compare that to Europe where it's only 1 sea away from the Muslim shitholes, but trust me, when Europe turns into Eurabia after 20 or 30 years, they will be flooding to America asap.
That "CONTRAPOINTS" basic font over driving footage is so Birdemic and I FUCKING love it.
Why is it okay to be at a party with women getting drunk and taking drugs  But it's not okay to drive a car because you might take or ruin someone's life  If you're a man I think both are bad
Pop Culture Detective makes really great videos about how the media justifies sexual violence against women in the form of kidnapping, stalking, and coercion. The idea that no means yes or that the woman wanted it all along are extremely prevalent in our society.
i'll send you my nudes if you want, but be prepared to be confused, when people see my girl parts they like it, when they see my guy parts they like it, when they see me use my girl parts to make my guy parts function they love it
Nice choice of Scotch!
Feels weird thinking about any of this, like the concept of "learning what consent is". I feel like that should be common knowledge, something you learn as a toddler. You ask and thus receive. To me this is simple, but if you're saying a lot of people *don't* get it, I guess I can say there must be something to blame, but I also don't want to accept that people are THAT stupid, that this seemingly basic thing is beyond them.  I think I can see where the people saying it doesn't need to be taught are coming from, and I don't think it's a place of "pretend it's not happening", it's more "just uninformed or ignorant". I personally don't think about frat crap or the "standard" human youth as I am neither, and my perspective isn't through a horny lens or something.  Maybe this is something people need education on, it just feels like they should've been able to learn themselves.
I VOTED THE JUDGE OUT OF HIS POSITION AFTER THE BROCK TURNER CASE! dont tell me voting doesnt help
cant get over how disgusting those frat guys with the banners are
I do think of Brock as a monster
The question is:  where does Led Zeppelin fit into all of this?
I mean if it's young Sean Connery we're talking about how can that be rape?? LMAO
I am watching your old videos and here at 13:14 you show how many subscribers you have, it is 4246. Today you have over 425000, and that is 100x as many. Wow. Congratulations.
hello I'm watching this IN THE FUTURE but I recognize that Trigun bit at the end you weeb.
I had to Unsub from SARGON. ICK.
You say what I wanted to say when I was too afraid to speak.!     Love your videos and please keep it up Contrapoints.!
Hey! Thunder-fool! Not having a lock my door is not an invitation to come into my house and take my stuff. That’s still theft. Imean... Oh why do I even bother?
holy shit you are hilarious I'm so glad i found your channel
00:49 that’s how a lot of people feel when you just dump them into random groups or because a few are bad you assume they are. White people, BLM, Alt-right, socialists, pro gun, republicans, democrats, Christians, atheists, and non binary people. This is why we need to stop doing this.
I watch a lot of youtube, and I've never come across someone as well spoken as you. I mean you just nail it every time.
Honestly, the prevalence of rape jokes in our society should be all the evidence anyone needs that rape culture is real.
I am surprised you put Darkmatter 2525 among the anti-SJWs.  I never saw him go after the feminists like a lot of other atheists YouTubers did.
How far you have come ContraPoints.  You nearly have twice the subscribers as Feminist Frequency.  Thank you for saving me from the Anti-SJWs.
Why is Dark matter in this video? He doesn't talk about politics or social issues at all on YouTube.
Yeah. I'm not totally convinced. You are arguing that rapists don't see what they do as rape. The problem is that the only evidence you present for this is the arguments of rapists themselves who have been caught. And people caught committing crimes generally say whatever they think will make them look less bad. Not really the most credible of self-reporting.
I’ve been - let’s put the word “rape” aside because it’s too loaded. But I’ve been sexually assaulted and/or taken advantage of by more people (not just men) than I want to remember. Let’s put a rough estimate at ten people.   I’m sure I’ll get responses blaming me for this, but I don’t care because if I did anything wrong, it’s being too kind and open and wanting to please/pleasure others even if they’re ignoring my humanity.
Okay I lied but here goes.
This may not be an easy video for me to watch at butt fuck o’clock in the morning but I’m sure you do a great job and I’m glad this video exists. I’m just a sensitive snowflake who’s been raped by what feels like the majority of the people I’ve ever been friends with, so. Excuse me while I go weep in a pillow and wait til I’m sober to learn shit.
The james bond clip made me think of something. I think "seduction" is one of the biggest problems when it comes to consent in our culture. People casually violate the boundaries of others and don't think much of it because they feel like the sexual assault and harassment they display is just a normal part of seducing a woman.
is it bad that I thought that framed picture of Anita Sarkeesian was your actual mom
Eyes Wide Shut = fraternity rape culture when you're over 50
Rape and rape culture are definitely alive and well in academia. Look up the disturbing shit that went down at The University of New Mexico. It was a dumpster fire. I had the joy of watching it blow up in their faces my senior year of college in my department. Their solution was for us students to take a sex crimes and harassment online course. This was full of the victim blaming bullshit like "don't get too drunk" and "never walk alone" that I can get from any rape apologist.
I live in the UK & female genital mutaliation is a problem in my country but for some reason people would rather help people from other countries working to combat this. I assume because of a feeling of distance & some sense of superiority but who knows.  The amount of people who seem passionate about problems further afield but not in their own back yard is staggering. Yes there are "children in cages" in the US but there are also thousands of children in cages all over the US due to abuse & wellness checks not being performed by social services. Children who are homschooled are more likely to be abused (&/or vica verca) there needs to be more protection of all children in the US not just the recent immigrants in trumps camp. It is great if you want to adopt a child born in another country but why are so many against adopting the thousands of children who need a forever home in their own back yard, or literal town?! Many people who compare suffering or divert the attention do so because of a literal ignorance.  I hate the term vertue signling but I see more comments saying they wish they could help this one homeless person by doing X, Y & Z, but they live too far away, as if there are no homeless people who live in a hundred mile radius of them!  I used to think people helped each other just to be nice & seeing the person improve was reward in itself but now I realize the multitude of complicated reasons people vocally support some movements over others, getting compliments & likes online being a common catalist. Having said that if the reason you help somone is because you are going to film yourself doing  a good deed & upload it online to get likes & praise, at least it encourages an individual to help somone. I am just begining to realize how few people are kind out of the goodness of their heart. Of course it is the quite selfless people working away not asking for recognition we rarely hear about, much like good news stories in todays media.
In my time of dying
"Our idea of rapists as inhuman monsters gets in the way of actually preventing rape" This is such a good point!
Years back, I watched thunderfoot a lot when he had his creationist merking career in full swing. I distinctly remembered when he swung over to "feminism bad". The problem is that the logistics of natural history are very defined and established. There's no argument over what plate tectonics are. So when "rape culture" is defined by yootoob intulecktuals as "a culture that explicitly promotes/ingores rape", the only place to go is to drill down in a masturbatory spiral over how illogical feminists are. There's no discussion of what "rape culture" is because definitions aren't up for debate.   There was this veneer of validity to thunderfoot's channel that got me to dismiss rape culture entirely, until I got out of highschool and started going to bars.
"5. Excavate (self explanatory)" Um... nO? please explain?
Do you like happen to have a twin that doesn't want bottom surgery or to transition that I can marry?
I love how you put Dennis in there XD
7:09 are you _sure_
I'm kind of ashamed that at the time you released this video I was buying in to nearly all of the anti-SJW talking points.  I just never bothered to watch videos from people on the "SJW" side because I thought they were all irrational.  You, hbomberguy, Shaun, Lindsay Ellis and Cursed E (twitter user who talks about trans issues) have changed my mind on a lot of issues.  Thank you so much.
Thank you for not only making great Youtube videos, but for introducing me to the wonder that is "One Toke Over the Line"
i love you
"I've beendrunk since 2008" *subscribes*
On an interesting note, talked about by just about no one, it seems like 90+ percent of rapes happen when one or both of the participants are drunk. After all, booze and the selling of booze is a BIG BUSINESS and god knows, we cant disrupt the flow of capital.
This is the consequence of the sexual liberation culture. Modern western society treat sex like it is a causal thing. Thus, rape (or kind-of-sort-of rape) everywhere.
2:53 Did Contra just reveal what state she lives in?
Fucking respect!! My new rule of thumb is that anyone who says that they are a "voice of reason," probably is extremely biased.
The Nuba people did in fact create a culture of zero male to female rape. As far as I know, they are the only known people to have achieved this. Of course they were also naked all of the time, had strict mating customs, and required men do the lion's share of the babysitting.
I am in the 11th grade right now. Last year, in sex ed, we actually went into depth about consent and spent a lot of time discussing what giving consent actually is, how old a person has to be to give consent, intoxication, etc. I know it doesn't speak for every high school in America but I think we're taking a step in the right direction, even if its just a small step :))
Laphroaig 10 is life
personally I don't find the idea of a partner who is not "into it "  exciting ,  being wanted sexually is a turn on
I'd encourage anyone who thinks like Sargon to _ask their own mother_ how they feel about that.
1:45 plus, as one of the world's _de facto_ major powers, the US cannot avoid exporting some of its cultural biases along with its projections of power, entertainment media, and so-called news.
To Sargon's argument that we'll never transcend rape culture I say, we transcended cannibal culture. Cannibalism was once a core part of many cultures worldwide. Of course there are still a few psychopaths who do it, but for the most part it's so stigmatized that even the most hardened criminals and brutal warlords shun it, and people even avoid it in situations where it would be morally right, such as cannibalizing already dead people in an emergency survival situation. When rape is not just a crime but an abomination, then we will transcend rape culture.
Brock Turner should be killed. . .
JuGgAlO cUlTuRe??? I'm sorry, but the way you said that was hilarious. 😂
After being on a months long binge of Crowder/Peterson/Shapiro, this is a totally new way of looking at things. I'm a huge advocate of keeping an open mind, and I'm always trying to sharpen my moral compass. This channel, and her insights have opened my eyes to the idea that I could be very wrong on a lot of assumptions. In a way, I'm sad that I haven't even felt guilt in my insistence that my world views have been at least mostly correct. But I'm very happy to see that not only was I wrong, but I'm not angry at the fact that my mind can be changed in the face of logic and reason. Thank you Contrapoints. Sincerely, A conservative white boi
i'm like a vampire , I need to be invited over the threshold first .. but then I WILL rape you .
2:38 reminds me of when I did my taxes for the first time. I was like "I do philosophy, this can't be that hard".... WRONG.  5 minutes later I was begging my mom for the number of her accountant
More than 90% in Egypt? Sourses?? I know its a problem in central Africa but really, Egypt?
What the fuck, James Bond
Contra stop being so damned good. P.S. Dam your good.
12:50 god damn you are so dishonest! it doesn't make you look good that someone "probably" would do something
11:50 are you claiming it's impossible to turn a No into a Yes?
9:10 now you're talking out of your fucking ass
6:11 what? WHAAAAT? the first thing that goes through a rapists mind before he's going to rape is "what can I do to not get caught doing this thing which is wrong". HOW THE FUCK DO YOU HAVE 368K SUBSCRIBERS?!!!!
God dammit this video is so fallacious. You are the master of fallacy.
*talks about rape culture*  I SHALT CALL UNTO THOU SOCRATES
fucking Sargon LMAO what a douche
You got my attention. And I'm a stubborn shithead that thinks the opposite way. So you changed at least one mind. Which is kinda sad, considering the fact that I'm a woman and I myself went through a lot of that shit. I guess it's easy to tell yourself that that's just how it is these days.
... so you want these nudes or not?
I deff. don't think America as a whole is a rape culture but, there are definitely rape cultures that exist here. I would say there's a big rape culture in Hollywood, and fraternities (as u already mentioned) as well. There's been countless directors and actors been raping and sexually assaulting actresses hence the #metoo movement. Rockstars, and hiphop stars have a reputation for statutory rape, and some of them regular rape, and many men in the industry period have been found to sexually assault women. I think when it comes down to it, what these cultures both have in common is they're somewhat exclusive tribalist that think they're superior to ppl, and this narcissists and tribalism can lead to extreme male chauvinism disregarding women's rights. There are many narcissist in Hollywood born w/ a silver spoon in there mouth who think they can do no wrong, and then there is the "brotherhood" of fraternities that excludes ppl that aren't of that group, and much like a football team, tends to look at itself as superior to others, which in turn leads to them thinking that they have a right to do w/e to all those that aren't in there club. They also consume alot of alcohol. I think anytime u combine alcohol, w/ narcissism, or tribalism, u make a group more likely to do all sorts of immoral things, including but not limited to rape. Islam is also very tribalist disregarding the rights of anyone who differs from the str8 muslim male, and not only condones but encourages atrocities such as rape done in the name of Allah, esp against non-believers, but Muslim women as well (even w/ little girls as young as 12, and instead of punishing the rapist the do "honor killings" against the women). I agree w/ u. Feminism is good, and like any movement, there are bad ideas and extremist, but the idea of equality and justice for all is necessary, and the a whole movement which is essentially good, shouldn't be $hit upon do to a few bad ideas.
I've seen most of your videos but this is the first time I'm commenting. You're doing incredible work, however I'd like to encourage the addition of a depth psychological perspective. This video especially seems really shallow to me and doesn't touch the gist of the problem at all.
Hey I really enjoyed this video awesome guitar solo at the end as well :)
Don't agree with his disgusting lifestyle but he is funny, I hope he heals from this debauchery.
I think your point about the good ideas over time sticking. I just wish that was more apparent to my guy which is just sick watching the rise of the right all over the globe. I realize when the pendulum swings to far in one direction it must swing back the other way. And I realize with so much movment on gay rights, migration, and in the U.S. a black president for 8 years this swing was comming without question. But it is still painful to watch and witnes even people I respect turning into shitlords. It is my seincere hope that people like you are helping to reduce the length of time we must endure the backswing of the pendulum before we can head in the right direction again. Thank you for what you doit probably makes a much bigger impact than you will know.
When she said the vice president vocally condemned Brock Turner, I was like, what? Pence did something morally conscious? Then I realized this was put out over two years ago before we had a president mired in sexual harrassment.
I didn't grow up with any discussions on consent. I had this belief that if I were in a relationship I'd signed a kind of contract, that I was owned and that my body no longer belonged to me. I don't know where that came from and I wasn't alone in this belief, many many women I knew/know held the same belief. I only really came to know about it a couple of years ago. I have a daughter and I'm so glad it has become something we are finally talking about, we've had many discussions on it and will continue to do so. There is much to do in the way of undoing old generational beliefs to get the next generations on track.
Saw someone else comment (can't find it now) that they would like to see you do a video about your stance on porn.   I too would like to know Contrapoints ... (Contrapoints's ... Contrapoints'?) stance on porn. I'm sure it's deliciously nuanced.
Wow. I had a lot of the same arguments that you disproved. Glad to be better informed.
The girl next to Adam Lyons looks like that dog fucker. Is that her????
This is great, but so influenced by RedLetterMedia (not a bad thing!)
"I've been drunk since 2008 and I never raped anyone." - Natalie Wynn. God bless 😂😂😂
I think you're inaccurately representing Sargon and TJ Kirk. I listen to their channels fairly regularly and I haven't gotten any kind of a vibe that would suggest that they would wholly disagree with you. They actually support earlier feminist movements, as do I.   I also agree with what you are saying, to a point. There is indeed a nuance to rape culture in western society, it does exist in certain aspects, and it should be addressed.  Also, no one is denying the sexism of the past nor the positive influence of past feminism on present day culture.   This video in parts felt like an overreach
I think Cult of Dusty is coming around
the ocean is anita
I'm from Brazil, and sex ed was fine for me. My biology teacher was also a psychologist and thought us about consent and *gasps* masturbation. But I know that I live in a privileged bubble... and I don't know how to help at all.
I'd be interested to hear what your view on porn is and where the blurry line lies between 'just a kink' and lowering the boundaries of what is acceptable thinking / behavior. I think in context of Western Rape Culture it may be important to start an open discussion about elements of hentai, and particularly loli porn. I learned of loli only recently, watching gaming youtubers troll around in VR chat, and apart from youtube, I'm not involved in any social platforms, so I don't know what the extent of the problem is. Anyways, the common 'joke' is 'Hey, it's not rape / pedophilia if "they"' (children) are drawn / animated.' and it feels like I'm hearing this line more and more often, which worries me.
Hey :). Does anyone know why Ayaan Hirsi ali is included in contra's list of proponents of rape culture?
I don’t know how everyone can just overlook the rape scene in Blade Runner, ruined the whole movie for me
Yes. Rape will never end, but the problem can be reduced. We are animals, yes, but weird animals who can think for themselves.
im horrified by the frat culture. it explains so much why so many sexist basic bros just exist having the thoughts that they have.
Slide guitar is on point, scotch is on point. Social convictions, on point...this is a woman I would be happy to get to know and call a friend.
Also: rape culture as one who misunderstands, mis-labels, and unjustly seperates types of rape makes more sense to me.
The idea of accidentally raping someone is a horrifying thought. So I'm all on board for hella consent. Sober as can be, avoiding  emotional outbursts, asking about each upping of the stakes physically, making sure it's known that I'm ok with backing down from any tier of contact. (though I'm not a mind reader, please let me know) double checking how boundaries relate to the last time etc. I don't know how to get more consensual than that.
Hey now, Thunderf00t is one of the good ones. I typically watch your videos because you're rational and you have well thought out viewpoints. But you're dragging this man's image and name through the mud because you don't agree with him but you don't even elaborate on that, you just call him a shithead. Its odd too because you've stated again and again that being an over aggressive feminist actually does nothing but turn people away from your ideas or cause.
Just play Crystal
What the fuck is the MARYLAND INCOME FACTOR
I've watched about twenty videos and I love you,,you are exactly what I needed fora new perspective on things. I have some comments on your terf videos that I am trying to work out a way to phrase that are not totally offensive as I agree that there is no need to be unnecessarily uncivil but I have not parsed it yet. For this video I wanted to comment that the British government attempted to ban rape porn from being distributed and yet feminist groups complained as rape is a very common fantasy of women. I don't expect you to respond and I would much prefer a response on your terf video if I find a way of phrasing it that would not be deeply insulting but I'm curious of your opinion of the contradiction/juxtaposition.
Your pretty great at pointing out bullshit. Keep it up
13:12 SHE MADE IT HAPPEN
Aye
Right-handed normie scum
Help I'm supposed to be productive but I've been binging your videos for 5 hrs and drinking wine I can't stop you're so fcking relevant G O D
If I may give a short response to Socrates, it seems to me that rape is usually committed by the dominant male - at least when we examine corkroaches and other critters. Historical examples, I mean the ones I have read, usually point tpward that this tendency exists in our species as well. This approach perhaps may indicate that decentralization of the power leads to a decrement in rape, theoretically.  The other element that has a potential effect on rates of crime is the probability to get any punishment. When this probability reaches 70 %, people tend to behave cool-blodedly. With the same level of anger I less likely break someone's nose in front of an audience than when only the gods can judge me. Of course this kind of generalization might be a wee bit far-fetched, and everybody else is an inherently moral entity, I am the only one who only fakes it.
Loved the moments when you went full  Mr. Plinkett.
Nice Zep at the end!
"I've been drunk since 2008 and I've never raped anyone". Omfg what a goddess. I've never related more lol
Oh, I see this video was made before Spectre came out.
When I first encountered one of your videos, it was via one of those "skeptics" (maybe Sargon) who  "totally destroyed/owned your arguments". So when I started  actually watching your videos on my own, I imagined some king of cazy SJW ranting endlessly about how every man is a rapist and whites are all racists etc... Instead, I find an articulate, intelligent and dare I say "rationall" youtuber who makes more valid points in 10 minutes than any of those "skeptics" in their entire career. Your videos kinda pulled me out of the rabbit hole and I'm really thankful for this actually.  This video is a perfect example of how to adress a complex issue without demonizing anybody or getting needlessly angry about it, thank you for that.
Didn't the latest Bond film have basically that same scene???
Watching this after the 2016 Presidential election is depressing. Sometimes the arc of history bends towards a rapey,  crypto-fascist orange turd.
I love Mozart.
Would I be wrong in assuming you, regarding video direction and comedy style,  have been - to some degree - been inspired by Red Letter Media?
12:29 is asking for a video on how Bill Maher isn't helping anything considered too divisive?
The Anita shrine kills me every time
GOD I CAN'T BELIEVE I USED TO LISTEN TO SARGON HES SUCH A DOOF
Something that often gets left out of the "Teach men not to rape" conversation is the bystander effect. Bystanders are more likely to involve themselves in a low-stakes but unambiguous situation than they are in an ambiguous high-stakes situation. (Ex: A stranger is more likely to help you pick up a dropped item--because dropping something is unambiguous--than they are likely to call 911 if you pass out in front of them if it's ambiguous as to whether you're having a heart attack or if you simply fainted.)   The "teach men not to rape" approach is helpful even if it doesn't change the behavior of rapists because it removes ambiguity from the situation and makes bystanders much more likely to intervene. It's similar to how anti-drunk driving campaigns may not have stop some people from choosing to drive drunk, but it has empowered bystanders to intervene and take away a drunk person's car keys.
You made an exceptionally good point at the beginning, but you kinda lost it in the rest of the video.  You correctly notice that the way wee see rape as the most heinous, most terrible crime possible, is actually a way to desensitize us to less grave and more subtle forms of rape.  Then, in the end, you contrast the way the media alternated between  been kind of sympathetic to Brock Turner and treating him like an absolute monster whose life should be destroyed forever.  As you said, he did something very wrong, but he probably isn't an absolute monster. And you seem to fail to see that the monstrification of Brock Turner is just a mirror of the sympathy he received, they cause each other. The one needs to affirm that he is the worst being ever lived, then the other feels the need to reaffirm that maybe he is "bad" (god I hate talking of "bad" and "good" people...), but he is not THAT bad. And honestly, since he was condemned, I think one can agree or disagree to some extent with the severity of the verdict, but there's not much room for this kind of absolute resentment towards "rape culture" that we have seen in response to the judgement. He was declared a rapist in court, that should be enough, if barely enough. Ok, maybe they could have gone heavier on him, honestly I don't know, I haven't seen the papers or the evidence. But he officially is a rapist anyway; guess the "light" sentence will have some justification and I don't buy that all of those people outraged by the verdict have actually gone through the papers and seen the evidence and they know that he actually is an heinous monster and deserved much worse. The point is that if we want to increase awareness about the less obvious and less violent forms of rape, then it is a must that we also stop seeing rape as the most heinous conceivable crime. Either we don't call less grave forms of rape "rape", or we must get over the idea that rape can also be a lesser crime than we usually think. It is an inevitable step; we will never accomplish anything if we try to persuade people that taking advantage of a drunk girl (when may you are a little bit drunk too) is the same thing as tying her and her boyfriend in a cellar and penetrate her multiple times as she screams and he is forced to watch, because... well... they are not the same thing. Just as breaking a man's leg is not the same as killing him.
I still don't get if what's asked at the end are news or nudes...
I'm so glad you're mentioning Thunderfoot here. I enjoyed his videos roughly ten years ago when his videos were about atheism, and then it strangely turned anti-feminist....
I just want to add, why can't we address this as well https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmeaAGe4uMo
You are fucking sexy
Sargon of Akkad has a punchable voice.
Ha! I just saw a frame from Blockhead's "The Music Scene"! Anthony Francisco Schepperd is an amazing artist, no?
Every time contrapoints does the “babey I’m sahry” voice I lose it it’s so freakin funny
I know I should probably know this by now but who is the person in the picture at the start Contra kneels in front of?
Logicked made it onto "response channel" channel list? Ouch... I mean, I think I get it, but ouch all the same.
use more it's always sunny clips please
Today I learned: no one lies under oath.
More ignorant, blind leftist ideals that overlook the facts.
Literally just bought one of those anal hooks before watching this.
I don't know how well this applies to you, ContraPoints or people on your side of the Atlantic (yes, I just assigned you a whole side of a planet, go go gadget privilege) but FGM is something that absolutely is happening in the west and in western cultures. It's a serious issue in the UK where children can be mutilated for their parents' beliefs, being sent offshore to avoid legal issues or doing it within communities with a culture of mutual silence. I don't dispute any of your points nor your position, I just wanted to spread awareness that this issue exists in "western" society, in my opinion humanity is too globalised now to decide what is or isn't an issue one can personally impact; spreading awareness is worth it. I wonder if that's just colonial guilt making me feel responsible for everyone's problems again.. Anyway liked subbed and cleaned up afterwards, love the video as always!
I think that saying that culture in the US is rape culture is extremely counter-productive. I would concede that there are rape cultures in the US, like frat culture, but I do think we're largely beyond the point of rape culture in the US, and into the inevitable background level of sexual assault that we should expect to see forever.  I don't buy that rapists don't know that what they're doing is wrong. Otherwise they wouldn't try to hide it, which they do. I found this article to make this point in a very persuasive way: https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/10/4/17933530/sexual-assault-me-too
You're from Maryland??? Awesome
"off the hook" Well, that's not a hook, and I, for one, wouldn't mind being on it :'D
imo, the idea the rapists are psychopaths kind of adds to another counter argument against victim blaming: if all rapists are supposedly crazy people: why does it matter what the girl was wearing and whether she was out at night? Eitherway psychopaths gonna psychopath right?
Rape culture doesnt exist in the US   Btw nice les paul.
9:05 since u directly impled this is what they say, could u at least put in a clip where tf or taa has said that "women should just stay home, not drink and dress like nuns"? wait they never did, and i would guess that's the case for the other 2 u showed. Really rekt em bud. Anyways, here's to teaching those rapists to not rape, and telling them it's wrong. I also like how ur video is just filled with the narrative of women as the sole victims. Most things considered "sexual assault" for women are not for men. The examples u give are for more prevalent in reverse.
at 11:28 a mixed up genderqueer flag appears under the clip with no background... i think your computer knew
Isn't "rape culture" and "sex culture" two different things though?   A bit...
I think part of the problem is the incredibly broad definition of "rape" which leads to the cognitive dissonance described here. I think narrower vocabulary might help move the needle. It's like if "assault" included "murder" in the definition. People think "rape means an unprovoked bloody sexual attack by a terrifying stranger" and that allows them to think "What I'm doing isn't that, so therefore it isn't rape, (and finally the coup de grace) what I'm doing isn't wrong". I think without better verbiage it will be very hard to crack this problem.
I actually heard Sean Connery didn’t like playing James Bond just for how he treated women.
Thank you. I do thank you for breaking this down and making it accessible to even the most ignorant, sexist, and privileged of human beings, even though they will of course never give up their privilege.
Claudia Brown is hunter i don.t give shit i hate her i am sorry for bias throw her whinyvoice
oh my god i love u
I recently saw Anita Sarkisian read. Then she sat down about two feet from me. I noticed two things, she is cute, and she is quite petite. Really pretty short. The fact that so many men, probably chest-beating "alpha males" online, find her so intimidating is hilarious. I could care less about video games since I stopped playing them when Ms. Pac man was the big feminist statement about video games. But I couldn't stop glancing at her, amazed that I was sitting so close to somebody who had evoked so many strong emotions in so many people. Apparently, her mind evokes fear in people. Her body certainly wouldn't.    Oh, her new book is about real life female villains. He intro about how it's OK to point out that some women do bad things was kind of boring. But her biography of a female Columbian drug lord was fun to listen to.
Damn. I needed your help to see the other side of things. Makes me look back on Kavanaugh recently in a different way.  Thanks for calling out frat culture!
these videos seem like a hilarious crash course in flawed logic
Brock did nothing wrong he hooked up with a drunk chick at a party there are witnesses then they were drunk walking home started making out she fell asleep while he was doing stuff . He did not find a drunk girl behind a dumpster and rape her.
Some good points. Films do indicate that attitudes have changed in recent decades. There is also an implied marital rape in 'Gone with the Wind' which results in the married couple happily resolving their differences. Also there are men who are rapists, who encourage other men to rape and who look to bend the law to excuse their behaviour. They should be called out. The point about the paucity of sex education and consent classes is also good.   Feminists and campaigners against rape would be far more successful if they acknowledged that most men in the US or Western Europe are against rape and believe that offenders should be severely punished. Their audience would then be far more receptive to criticism of particular individuals or organisations such as fraternities. The reason why the most vociferous campaigners do not do this is because they have weaponised rape. They wish to use rape as a weapon in the gender war, as a stick with which to beat all men into submission to their broader demands. (Fraternities should also be viewed as a class issue as much as a gender issue. One of their appeals to prospective members is that they offer membership of a network of mutually supportive individuals throughout a man's later career and life in the same way that freemasonry does. I doubt whether members of fraternities would ever advocate raping each others' sisters. I suspect that their identified victims are usually viewed as socially inferior).   At 12: 29, there is the implication that Ayaan Hirsi Ali (pictured right) is a 'Troglodyte on Youtube still clinging to justifiably outdated notions about sex and gender'. This is a woman renowned for opposing forced marriage, honor violence, child marriage and female genital mutilation. Opposition to which of these is 'outdated'? The discussion at the start of the video about rape cultures in the Third World is misconceived. The primary focus of most commentators including Sargon is not to change behaviour in Africa or the Middle East but to change behaviour in Europe and in Sargon's case especially the UK. In the UK, there has been no successful prosecution for FGM despite the number of victims who are British citizens being in the thousands. There have only been two cases brought to court, the first of which was of a surgeon who had attempted to repair the damage done to a woman who had undergone FGM at the hands of someone else - presumably a cynical attempt by the authorities to appear to be doing something while doing absolutely nothing to protect young girls. Also in the UK, various police forces have ignored the rape of thousands of young girls because the perpetrators were Muslim. What is also notable is the condemnation by the majority of feminist commentators not of the rapists and mutilators but of the people who demand that girls and women be protected regardless of their race and the race of their abusers.
"I don't have any cultural influence in Egypt, but I DO have some influence in North America."  Translation: "I don't want to focus on real issues, because that's hard. I'd rather kick back and take the easy, ineffective road that accomplishes nothing."
One critique...Bill Maher and Richard Dawkins have said they are feminists and don't condone rape or the culture around it. But I'm guessing you looping them in was in reference to Bill's old comedy and Richard's tendency to make light of Western women's issues in favor of whats happening elsewhere being worse
Is there a transcript (or captions) available for this?
I've been raped but guess only female rape matters
Laphroaig is good, Talisker is better
It's almost like our sexual assault laws are a distinct form of overcompensation designed to sweep any form of reasoned discussion under the rug. You make it such a loaded crime that anyone that doesn't seem fit the mold of serial raping monster can be painted as victims of over-reach. At the same time you get to make a big pandering gesture to show how anti-rape you are so everyone complaining about it should shut up and go away.
I think a good portion for the sexual assaults that happen is because people are ignorant that they are sexual assaulting someone. people incorrectly think that rape is always violent when a lot of it happens due to emotional manipulation, verbal coercion and taking advantage of incapacitated people. plus the pressure for men to derive self worth from sex not only leads them to sexual assault people but sometimes makes them unable to realise when they have been assaulted. And the totally dumb idea that you can't "control yourself" even though you have an actual brain
The Led Zeppelin outro. OMG. Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees. Also, love your informational, clearificational (probably not a word) content. Love.
Ewww Ew EEW i hate this. Because of this I sometimes don’t even want to be a woman.
1:53 Hey, it's the slogan of Kavanaugh's Frat at Yale.
This should be blasted in all schools
I don't know what to make of this monologue. Your comment about the impossibility of offering a definition of feminism signalled a start that pulled me in but by the end you were defending feminism as a fallible movement but one that eventually allows for good ideas to triumph. I was anticipating that you would suggest that the definition of rape is equally difficult to reach a consensus on, which you approached, seemingly, but then pulled back from and went into a broader discussion. For a moment when the placard of 'Rape is Rape' was shown, I thought you might challenge such a tautology, but nope. To give some context, several years I listened to a radio program that failed miserably at hosting a debate on the topic of rape. On one side, a male researcher was arguing that biology doesn't care about feelings and that forced impregnation is a mating strategy; one the other hand, a female lawyer was arguing that rape is a cultural phenomenon having nothing to do with sex and only about power. The producers and the host of the program had so obviously failed to recognize that both guests weren't even speaking the same language and as if to highlight this lack of awareness, the first caller talked about how she had been raped by her mother.   So much about how rape is defined, at least in legal terms, relates to the definition of consent, which itself continues to undergo increasingly narrow parameters. Or on a biological front, is rape related to the threat of unwanted impregnation? Lastly, is rape just a metaphor that must be defined in a way that also covers the experience of a daughter with regards to her rapey mother?
The Brock Turner case was sketchy in details and as such plea deals normally happen
I know she doesn’t want me to watch these videos now but daaaaaaaaamn does she have good point

thunderfoot is part of the shitlord squad?
In my...time of...dyyyIING
That row of portraits with captions like "The Advocate", "The Skeptic", etc., is one of the most cringe-inducing things I've ever seen in my life
ContraPoints good damn job!
Your choice of musical example for rape culture wasn't very good.
So you are arguing about different things, great I'll dig this grave to lie in while you all find a solution. I'll just lay here and maybe someone could revive me after the death of all human kind.
Sweden aka rape culture and social justice
le nozzeeeeeeeee di figarooooo
Just want to say that I came into this video more or less from the side of people like ArmouredSkeptic,Thunderfoot, Tj,etc. After watching your video You haven't so much changed my mind about the yes/no answer to the question of "does the US have a rape culture", you have tough added nuance to my own conception. Also your james bond bit was spot on. I was watching the James Bond series start to finish a month or so ago and had to take several breaks during many of the early films due to the extremely rapyness of the male characters.
Honestly, I never even thought about it like this, and I'm actually a rape survivor.  When people say, "We live in a rape culture" it kind of makes it sound like they're talking about all of American society which I don't think is true. But when you point out that their are numerous smaller communities within Western society where rape is not condemned and even condoned, *that* makes sense and rings true. I'm two years late, but thank you for wording it like this. I'd never thought about it from that angle.
"since I've been drunk since 2008 and I never raped anyone" I love this guy, so glad my teacher recommended him.
12:00 also what makes the James Bond rape scene even more creepy is that people don't automatically see that as unacceptable either because they genuinely believe that it's fine or assume that it's fine because the evil feminists say it's not!
4:55 I think that is an essential point that we need to consider when discussing paedophilia. I'm not an expert on psychology but most paedophiles I've spoken to either intensely fetishise the perfection of children and teenagers (which we tend to do, thank you sit-coms) and/or emphasise that it's silly that a 13 year old can't consent but a mentally immature 21 year old can (something we don't like to talk about).
plinkett, is that you?
this is like a wack ass plinkett rip off in drag
I don't believe the "fraternity rape culture" is exclusive to the fraternity only, either. When you described the way that these young men interact with each other, it reminded me of a documentary called "The Mask We Live In" which describes how men aren't allowed to show affection or weakness of any kind in front of their peers and how it drives them into depression and violence. If we could slightly reshape society to make it so that women and men could both enjoy the privilege of being themselves without being pressured by said society into their gender-approved roles, that would also reduce rape. Because then it would be alright for men to hug each other, and it would be alright for a bro to kiss a bro on the cheek. It wouldn't be gay for a guy to sleep in the same bed as a bro, and being gay wouldn't even be a derogatory term anymore.   That's the kinda society i'm looking forward to.
Is Richard Dawkins in there? There's this picture at 12:34 and it really looks like him in one old photo.
No, we do not have a culture that normalizes and glorifies mental illness  Oh wait...
Someone start a Grind band called Isis Rapelord
More  guitar!  Finally I found again the video where you play "In my time of dying" -- great at Led Zeppelin. Now with this comment, perhaps the search "Led Zeppelin contrapoints" will lead people to this one… and new ones? Oh do I hope so!
All feminist are rapist !!!
No.
I remember in hs that our health ed teacher pretty much doubled as a sex ed teacher (but we never called it sex ed! God no, not that name!) He told us about protection. He said a few times, no means no, then proceeded to hand out packets on how women should behave in order for us to reduce the chances of getting raped. The packet had, no drinking or drugs! Go out with a group of trusted friends! If you do drink in public, guard your drink! And... that was it. We then got some piss poor explanation of stds and how they can wreck us. I think the only good thing we got from that class was when a guy who had aids came in and talked to us about how horrible it was. He had no extra money, relied on government for everything, and was even shunned when he first found out years ago because people were so scared. A common cold could kill him.
"...that we dare not even joke about it."  Ha, I wish! Unfortunately there are lots of people, mostly guys, joking about rape. Particularly on the internet. Particularly on those websites where all the covert womenhater are. It is disgusting!
who's the woman she keeps referring to as mother?
Sargon Logic: "We'll never completely solve a problem and that's why we should never bother trying to solve it at all."     HUR DUR DUR DURHHhhhh
your making me a fucking leftist again.
I have a weird veiw of western culture to me it includes bits of Africa most of the middle coast north and America the Australia.
You had me interested and listening intently, despite my disagreements, when you casually and unironically threw out "misogyny" at 7:58. I'm sorry, but you don't just get to do that to people you know next to nothing about. What do you know about that man, his desires and motivations, his history and youth, his flaws and vices? Unless you can identify him personally, I don't think it's wise to just tar whole groups with a single epithet because it seems to fit.
The Mozart on this channel is fantastic.
Thank you, Nice work
The thing that the pick up artist says is recited verbatim by Dennis on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. But I really can't tell if It's Always Sunny got it from that guy or if he stole it from them.
I'm partial to whiskey also, and I'm now partial to you my favorite youtuber. Thank you.
aNITA! gedodamychild hood!
contrapoints is a self declared dog whistling racist. watch the video on "western culture" and listen to him repeatedly dog whistle here in this video.
Devil wears Prada has a pretty rapey scene in a fountain . That no one ever mentioned it
☺️☺️
And respect for being a RLM fan. I see you doing a Plinkett.
You're pretty much my favourite.
I love your videos and agree broadly with this, but the constant painting of these individuals as racist is hyperbolic and disingenuous in the same way you're accusing them of being. There was surge in feminist and far left ideology that came into the mainstream, and sprung up within atheist groups in the form of atheism+ which led to the wave of responses and critiques of bad ideas. It's entirely hyperbolic to assert all feminism is bad based on the bad ideas asserted by the people they responded to, but we have to realize these newer forms of feminism and feminist ideas were the face of feminism as a whole in the media and many of the ideas presented were presented as though they were representing feminism as a whole.   The same goes for the rape culture debate. I very much appreciate your nuanced approach. Bringing up individual, small cultures that do exhibit rape culture while acknowledging American society in general hates and punishes rape was something I wish more people would do, and we absolutely need more comprehensive sex ed. Your approach is not the approach of everyone talking about rape culture. At least in my experience people talking about rape culture condemn all of American society and anyone that asks for the process, which is hyperbolic. As a response these channels point actual societies and countries that are rape cultures to that extent, and it's not racist to point this out about Islamic predominate countries or Islamic doctrine. Don't go full Ben Affleck.   Some of these YouTubers I like, definitely not sargon, and by dismissing them as racist they  and their audience can dismiss any of the other points you have to say. None of their critiques, He is points, or hyperbole exist within a vacuum, and ignoring the context these videos are made in and the points they are responding to only leads to less nuanced discussion.   I doubt you read your comments so this is shouting into the wind.
I fucking adore you
I fucking love that song
lol I did a class presentation on scabies too when I was like 15
I was actually fucking baffled that that Bond scene exists and that the dude is supposed to be the protagonist of the movie. My jaw fucking dropped, because that is just disgusting. I had no idea this was a thing and that it was so popular too.
This channel is amazing. Thanks for some very nuanced, interesting thoughts.
I love this channel and I also love armouredskeptic and darkmatter2525
I don't mean to be negative, however, I NEED to be honest. I identify as non-binary, homosexual/gay. And I find it HIGHLY offensive that you are using gay as a slang for bad. Please think about that.
Wtf that was some wicked slide guitar at the end! Wasn’t expecting that!
@1:20 Haha
We dont live in a rape culture!  Meanwhile in the  catholic church...
"contrapoints"? More like *talking points* ...
There's different types of rapists. Studying the psychology and typology of rapists show that there are different types, mindsets, and beliefs of rapists. You need to look them up, since every side of the argument is generalizing all these different types of rapists into one homogenous blob, and ascribing one set of traits and motivating factors to them, which simply doesn't align with reality. Rapists aren't all the same, and you can't deal with them using one, single approach that's based in anecdotal evidence. The research already exists, so please use it.
You lost me at not thinking Brock Turner is a monster. I do think he's a monster. There are instances of people thinking they have consent when they don't, but Brock Turner isn't that guy. Some rapists might not be going into it wanting to rape, but there are a lot that just don't care about what the other person wants.
My college made us take an online course this summer before going into my freshman year, and I found it very informative. It was a very informative course about rape and consent. It was very comforting knowing that all students had to take it before going into school.
Can we be best friends? Can I just like call you when I try to explain things to people and they don't get it, can we just rant? Please? Cool
For every Brock Turner hoe nigga who catches a case for shitfaced fingering, there's hundreds if not thousands of actual rapists out there who get away with it scot free. Brock Turner was not a rapist; at worst he committed sexual assault. I don't really care about some privileged white elitist's future, but calling his crime "rape" is a misuse of a term that's already too loosely thrown around, and it downplays the severity of violent non-consensual sex.
Ew. I haven't watched any James Bond movies. Now I certainly don't want to
That part of James Bond movie made my skin crawl and my vagina shrink dry..
"I have no influence..."  Uh yes you absolutely do.  there are plenty of ways you can  influence other countries. You the. Play some pop song as if its some analogy to... What? Rape? The fuck?  you really need to understand context
That rape scene from James Bond was disturbing D:
I believe what the Right, myself, and such mean by 'There is no rape culture in America' simply is that rape is NOT something that is socially acceptable in our culture/society. We do NOT have a culturally ingrained belief that rape is the victims fault. Countries such as the Middle East and Africa do.  Our Western society and culture looks down on, and out-right hates and even witch-hunts those who make rape jokes, commits rape, talks about committing rape, or comments suggesting it's not bad.  So no, we do not have a rape culture.
i have a similar opinion of racism - because racism is considered so heinous and despicable, people who are racist in less world shattering ways - like subtle colorism or dumb 'jokes' - don't think "this is kinda racist, does that mean it's wrong?" but "this isn't slavery or holocaust so it can't be racist". it's why you hear people spout arguments like "i don't think one race is superior/i don't hate black people so i'm not racist, ergo i never do or say racist things"
Didn't think I'd ever see Natalie do a Harry Plinkett impression.
I love all your apparent Plinkett allusions
SVU recently did a Brock Turner episode where the "Brock" character tearfully confessed because his guilt was killing him. If only.
That is a sweet guitar.
OMFG Contra, your videos are SO FUCKING GOOD!!!
Laphroaig - nice.
Alright, so if it was boiled it down, there isn't a rape culture but some kind of Sub-culture that blurs the line of consent.
2:20 ay
Persecuting pedophiles? This is why the right thinks they can't reason with the left. If you try to meet with a minor through the internet, you have made a SERIOUS mistake. Therefor you are not being persecuted by the person who brought you out into the open. Until our police do more to police these things, it's just fine for vigilantes to blast these predators all over the internet. Their track record speaks for itself. Show me the examples of vigilantes who have outed innocent people? They provide all the evidence in their videos, and it is very clear that these pedophiles are guilty. They tell the pedophiles immediately how old the decoy child is, so that there is no confusion. They then come to meet this decoy child. Is that not enough evidence for you? One would have to work fairly hard to frame someone in this manner, so I'm not going to be giving them the benefit of the doubt.   You may not ever make a single "mistake" in your life where you prey on a child. You are not even allowed one strike. As soon as your compulsion takes over and you cross that line, you must be blasted all over the internet so that people around you know that you are a predator of children. There is no doubt that these vigilantes are preventing plenty of children from getting abused. They often provide enough evidence for the police to actually make an arrest, and get a conviction. So fuck off with your defense of pedophiles.
interesting i am curious by your own lousy definition that made the safest societies for women (and men ) ever as suffering from ''rape culture'' . is there ever a society that your definition apply to ? is there ever a time in human history where your culture doesn't exist ?  But of course it's humanities bullshit it cannot adhere to simple logic  i understand how this works even if the definition doesn't apply because the crime is reviled and prohibited it still exist because i am going to find a way to prove how this society conspires to support rape in secret . Or there is a subset of Predatory people that do this crimes . (incidentally the more wildly accepted theory )
I definitely see the Plinkett influence in your earlier work.
Off the hook. Ha.
Did you know that till 1996 it was legal in Germany to rape a woman in a marriage?  I know that nobody is reading this comment anyway, soo..
Huh, I guess the West existed two years ago.
I honestly dont understand the point of fraternities.
Heavy/punk rock cultural?
you had bad parents
it's like watching that planket show from starwars criticque  but he was a finctional character
Utter degenerate. At one hand saying hedonism is glamorous, next sentence saying rape is abominable. Alcohol and rape are often intertwined and are both pretty much sins.  Why not do altruistic work like a true hero would do? The positive thing here is that hedonistic promiscuous inferior fools get way less children on average so their genes will eventually die out.
Before finding your channel I used to watch almost every “central/right” YouTuber you mentioned while assuming they were a voice of reason.  We definitely need more channels like yours
Here in America we like to punish our rapists by sending them to jail so they can be gang raped
Did Martin Luther King Jr really cheat on his wife and plagiarize his dissertation? Oh well, life goes on.
I love your content
Rape culture doesn't exist. Rape is not a cultural thing. Any one from any culture can rape.
Well murder is pretty old, likely as old as animals themselves! Yet most modern societies managed to reduce it to a very rare occurrence (modern societies would be more like Canada, a lost of wstern Europe/Japan, etc.).  As far as rape goes, I grew up in Canada, we had better sex ed. (there was very little talk about abstinence and it seemed dismissive to me at the time, like the teacher would say it's actually the only 100% safe way, but we don't expect everyone to be abstinent unless they want to go to work for the church)... The fun thing is that the one place I remember learning clearly about consent as a young man was in catholic education class where the teacher touched the subject and basically said "if the girl says no, even if you are in the middle of doing your business, you stop" this is how a man ought to treat a woman.   Somehow I though everybody got the memo, but that religion teacher did not have that much influence :-/
Whoa. That's some dirty sexy slide guitar playin'
❤
sex ed really could be greatly improved even in countried that look down on America's backwards sex ed like the one I live in. we learned about (mainly) hetero sex, STIs, anatomy and pregnancy but consent or assault were never important themes. the classes seemed to work on the assumption that everything we were taught about would of course be 100% consensual.
imho the way it was and currently is viewed, pms is kind of a myth of patriarchal psychiatry though
It seems like maybe where people get tripped up is assuming that "normalizing and permitting rape" implies that one understands what rape is, when it seems that most people who do that only do so because they don't understand that what they're normalizing and permitting *is* rape
How about the rape culture in Sweden, which has only made worse by the feminist government?
Omg I just realize who you are, I used to watch your videos way back in 2008 2009! So glad I found you again!
well well well....... so i can die easy...
Just a few seconds in -- need to compliment the whiskey.   yayyy corporate brand identity validation
I like Contra...or Natalie, or whoever. but this is one of the worst argued concepts on the channel.   Brook Turner, old 007 flicks, 1 rapist AMA = rape culture ? weak    You know a better way to prove a rape culture ?  talk about the rape and sexual assault of men and boys.  Unlike with Brook Turner, where the male rapists who get laughably light sentences are far and few between, look at female teachers raping boys and the consistent pathetic sentences handed down to female sex offenders. Society sees men being raped as a joke, not a problem.  How many times have you heard a "don't drop the soap" joke about prison ?  I bet a lot, and I see no feminist outrage over it.
You defined "Rape culture" (roughly),as where rape is normalised and victims are shamed.  What about US prisons?
The way you reffear to Anita make me tear up while laughing 😂😂
One of the more balanced vlogs on this subject I've seen.
STOP IS NOT IN MY VOCABULARY.  I prefer "sorry!!!"
THEM: "Why are feminists complaining about first-world problems when there's still female genital mutilation in Egypt?"  ME: "What? I can't be against _both_ those atrocities? Why didn't I get that memo?"
rape culture in muslim societies seriously nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo my country algeria has the most harsh punishements for rapists and also 70 percent of lawyers in my country are female.
There is the following scenario that I cannot figure out (it occured to me re. Brock Turner, and the Frat shit, even though its only marginally related): the male and female both get drunk to the extent that their inhibitions are completely screwed, and end up having sex, but there are bad feelings and regrets the next day. If say female (or the other way around) accuses the male that he has raped her, and that she consented just because she was drunk, or cannot remember if she consented etc. The other party, in his defense, argues drunkedness, and that he had sex with the person just because he was drunk, and so on...   How does this get resolved? The evidence - blood alcohol level test would be useless by the time accusation would be put forward. What's left is just the claims and counterclaims put by the two people involved in it.   This has not happened to me, and those whom I know, that have had this sort of thing happen, resolved it by mutually agreeing that it was a mistake. But an argument that this was/is/could be rape can be made but I just cannot wrap my head around it. A case fot rape can be made - the consent, if given under the influence, can end up somewhere in the 'date rape' area. But there is also the fact that it was not one person exploiting others diminished capacity/judgement, if both were equally intoxicated. Can someone with more wisdom and learning help me out?
My GAAAAD u r a genius (e)......love Mozart 😃😄😍😘😆😆😆
Just sent this to my friend who and i will debate the subject of this video in the near future. The "in my time of dying" riff at the end was cool!
At 9:45 i really wish you'd highlighted the previous sentence as well: "He has never been violent to anyone INCLUDING HIS ACTIONS ON THE NIGHT OF JAN 17 2015."  Just...wow. He implies alcohol is the only cause for his child's behavior and outright claims that it wasn't "violent" as though obvious physical harm is necessary for it to count as rape or violence.  Adam Venit seems to be pulling the same excuses after sexually assaulting Terry Crews. It wasn't "violent" in the common usage of the word and therefore, he claims, he did no wrong.
There is no FGM in Morocco Algeria or Tunisia, you shouldn't just say North Africa
I knew Brock Turner when I was 14 (I was friends with his older brother, who's my age). He was annoying. There's no point to this comment. It just still blows my mind seeing him regularly come up in conversations about rape culture. I just never looked at him and thought "I bet that little prick is going to become world famous for raping someone behind a dumpster someday."
tbh the james bond clip scared the shit out of me, what the fuck is that stupid ass romantic music playing over a very terrifying rape scene?????? SHES STRUGGLING TO THE VERY END WHAT THE FUCK
I'm curious as to what DarkMatter has ever said about rape??
I'm in love with you. The part about taxes reminded me of that.
9:15 "sheeps"
Put new atheist to shame
100% agree with the first point: we have more responsibility and more likely success in dealing with our local issues instead of stuff on the far side of the globe.
Sargon is a fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck. What a fucking asshole, " RAPE WILL NEVER EVER EVER EVER GO AWAY." What a fucking fucking fuckasshole. WHAT... WHAT. IS THE POINT OF THAT STATEMENT.. . ?  WHAT WILL IT ACCOMPLISH? AND WHAT. IS THE POINT OF ITS ITS FEROCIOUS INTENSITY? What a fucking idiot
That goldfinger thing was wierder in the book because she was gay.
He is just circulating what supremacist Jews and alt right about Muslim countries. I live in a Muslim country and rape is almost non existence. Most of the rape in the Muslim countries is done by westerners. No mentioned of the shithole of Hindu India which is the capital of the rape industry. Pathetic. No mentioned of Jewish rapists like  Steve wynstein, Weinstein, Hoffmanstein, Epstein, polanskisetein laurestein and schneiderman who are raping white women big time and nobody has the courage to say that. Just imagine if those names mentioned above are Muslims.
Tbh, period blood art would probably be considered really metal and hardcore, if cis-dudes had periods.
Also, you have an influence on how your government reacts when it's important allies have awful women's rights records. Any serious western feminist in America should be lobbying for sanctions on Saudi Arabia.
That James Bond clip made me incredibly uncomfortable...
What is rape? Rape lies on a spectrum, but things that fall on that spectrum are both unwanted and not consensual. I say both because if a hot lesbian unexpectedly grabs me by the neck and kisses me and I like it, I don't find that rapey. But if someone with bad breath all of a sudden forces their tongue down my throat, that's kind of rape-y, even if technically both acts are the same. From their perspective, the only difference is in my reaction to their sexual advance - if the reaction is "ooh - this is good" it's not rapey and if my reaction is "NO" it is rapey, ESPECIALLY if they keep going after a clear and explicit "no" is given.  The risk of crossing the line exists because they don't have consent in advance of doing something. If they don't have consent, the person might be okay with their advance or they might not, but they don't know until after-the-fact. Explicit consent guarantees before-the-fact that they are not doing anything rapey.  And people do cross that line a lot. Sometimes people are just really turned-on/horny or they have low impulse control or they are drunk and they want to go for it. But that's not an excuse. If the other person doesn't want them to, that shit is rapey.
You know what's funny is that before I saw you as a girl, I saw you as an intellectual. Somehow, becoming a hot chick somehow made you look less smart.
I'm basically binging your videos after having discovered your channel recently, and not to downplay the importance of the actual content of this video, but that slide guitar uuuunnnnffff
Please don’t use the guardian as a source because they are soooooooooooooooooooo biased
Oh no, the just arc of history argument, that shit isn't true at all, a lot of bad ideas stick around, like racism, fascism, communism, religion... Sometimes these idiotic ideas fuck shit up for everyone.
In general in Scandinavia it is cstomary to beat the shit out of people who sexually assaults a unconcious human being, Brock Turner was lucky that the Scandinavian who stopped him was a polite upper middle class dude, things would have been quite bloody if Brock had been caught doing this by the less affluent among us. I know the cultural mores of my people. In this particular aspect ancient mores still prevail(meaning the pagan ones).
Failure to distinguish between sub culture and culture, fail, complete fail, rethink that argument. 3:06 to 3:41.
You still use paper tax forms in the US? What a primitive society.
Pretty sure you have more infuence over Egypt than the average Egyptian does, in general the citizens of the Empire have influence over the peons of the vassals, you fucked this up in less than 113 seconds.
The guy at 6:54 is NOT a rapist, if his account is true. You're also taking Thunderf00t and the 7:06 guy out of context, and it's painfully obvious.  Rape is only rape when the girl was either pass-out drunk and got groped(no ability to consent), or when the rapist continued his sexual advance after hearing an articulated and unambiguous "no"
You should actually consider doing a live stream with Sargon about this topic, yes, he comes off as an asshole but at the same time do you think you don't? He would actually have a genuine conversation with you and even try to help make a change. He's not a bad person and neither are you, his arguments aren't directed at actual feminists but virtue signalers who want to score social points from their friends and community. Sargon may not look it but from what I can tell he actually wants to help others, really help others, not just talk about it.
So which is it, Do we live in a rape culture or is the signals for actual consent to watered down?
Hello there!  Fucking love your videos. I've wasted enough of my life watching YouTubeZz tho so do you have a recommended reading list or some shit.
I love this channel.
The problem with obsessing over whether minor differences in social interaction make a situation rape or not, is that it removes all spontaneity and idiosyncrasies from the relationship. Everyone agrees that using force it wrong, but that playful interactions like the James Bond scene could come with the threat of punitive measures, depending on his/her later interpretation of the play wrestling changes the dynamic for everyone - including people who enjoy those situations.  There is an element of changing yourself rather than changing everyone else - don't put yourself in situations that have the kinds of interactions or people that you don't like.
You may say that the US *has* a drug culture but you wouldn't say that it *is* a drug culture as feminists do about rape culture. Your own analogy fails.
Joe Biden Is a Hypocrite
did u break ur finger
Ok, coming back to this for a minute. You are not powerless to stop human rights violations in other parts of the world. If feminism wanted to, they could convince the U.N. to begin physically opposing such things. They could, for example, begin giving less privileged areas of the world some of the benefits of the western world in exchange for them not acting like savages. Every time some little girl gets her clitoris cut off the town that did it gets its running watter shut off.   After all, part of the reason we have such a low murder rate in the U.S. is because modern conveniences have pacified the majority of our society. Most of the crime and violence in our country come from hungry people.
Aaaaaaand this why I needed to start watching you.
I fucking LOVE your videos your silly fuck.  No srsly I'm very glad you have a ton of subscribers and a damn good like/dislike ratio. I hope some of those come from "the other side."  <3
In Italy and Germany there is no or a very little fraternity boy/girl culture. And this helps a lot to cut rape culture. This frat shit is a Anglo saxon problem.
Just a minor point of pedantism: the "o" in the first syllable of "Pokemon" is not, strictly speaking, a long "o" like the "o" in "open" but a short "o" like the "o" in "pocket". The name "Pockemon" is a portmanteau of "Pocket Monster".
Teaching about consent seems to be the biggest step  we can take, in my opinion. Great video
I think the fact, that female teachers raping students are almost never called "rapists" and the act is generally glorified/romanticized is also a big argument to consider.
Pm nudes
No one rational is fighting against the idea of education about consent, but in the way you suggest, it should be done. Many feminist emphasize blaming masculinity for rape, while others emphasize singling out men as blame for rape.   There was a couple of pro-feminist videos that supported the idea that ONLY boys should be educated, or mostly exclusively boys. To teach about consent, the government has to do it in a general and equal sense that applies to everyone, not just one specific group.
contrapoints i love you but you failed to high-lite that womens rights weren't from "complaining for forty or fifty years" it was the riots that CAME from those "forty or fifty years" of nobody giving a fuck, NOT the "forty or fifty years" themselves. COME ON CONTRAPOINTS
Nuanced, lucid and well researched. Nice one.
Pre rape Jiu Jitsu lol
As I always say, *It's not rape if both parties consent and know what they are consenting to.*
Great video! There's also people who believe that most people are actually fine with rape, but just pretend to not be because it's more socially acceptable
Why are hating on Atheists? We agree with you on this subject.
Oh shit a fellow Marylander!
[dislike]  I disagree not because I disagree with the reasonable suggestion that 'rape is bad', but rather: 1. slandering your opposition, regardless of them not necessarily being 'rape apologists', rather simply having differing opinions about rape then you do. It is more than reasonable to debate someone's points, however taking a small picture approach to what they say is not the best way to help people formulate what they should think about you or your opponent, putting people out on a visual map that may as well say 'shitlords' in captions above it is pushing your own opinion, when people see these YouTubers now they are more likely to be dissuaded from analysing their work, which is a failure of dialogue.  2. the notion that the west is lenient on rapers is far fetched, there are people who get away with it, however the west is so much better at human/ women's rights than most other places. We aren't perfect, however there are specific clauses in our legal systems that mean that people can be brought to justice, calling the west a rape culture is about as true as calling it a baseball culture, and for someone who has never touched a baseball bat before, nor do I ever plan to, its a huge misnomer.
I'm pretty sure both Brock Turner and the Girl he fucked were both drunk af how is it rape?
Can someone explain why richard dawkins/bill mager is "still clinging to outdated notions about sex and gender?" 12:30. Gr8 vid and thx in advance for whom ever replies.
Sigh. Rape culture would mean that there is a culture that rewards/promotes rape. There isnt....at least not in the west and no amount of sophistry will change that. "Hey jordan peterson do you belive in god?" " depends on what you mean by god and also what do you mean by belive" and lmao at "on the other hand" *shows footage of women doing what they chose to do/not forced to do and get paid for*  intellectual heavyweights of youtube feminism
Okay, I was wrong for years.
"In Muslim countries they teach girls to not get raped. In the west we teach boys to not rape." OH REALLY?! Western politicians saying things like "rape is sex, and women like sex", my very own western city having a problem with male teenagers gang raping girls, western detectives and defence lawyers asking rape victims what they were wearing, western movie protagonists sexually harassing and raping female characters 'until they love them', ... shall I go on? I think I've made my point. Which was also yours. And any normal person's.
'Off the hook'  You think you're slick, huh.
Speaking of the weird contradiction between the extreme hatred of child abuse and fetishizing of youth, remember that one guy from the red pill extra footage who said he'd fuck children if he could?
I wonder what kind of overlap you might see between people who deny that there's a culture of normalizing and accepting rape, and people who voted for 45. HMMMMMMMM
Really good vid... the phrase "normalizing rape is rape culture" gives me pause.. if we observe rape as a natural phenomena in the wild is that akin to "normalizing rape"?  I'm just curious whether a simple naturalistic observation can fall morally short. If not its worth pointing out the semantic death trap.... and painting a large circle round it in luminous paint... maybe put some warning signs up.. we don't want trouble from Sematic Justice Worryers  Please forgive my ignorance... it is just that.
Keep in mind that Sargon lives in the UK, a country notorious for mostly ethnic Pakistani rape gangs. Over there, it makes of whole lot more sense to complain about femnist' priorities.  Don't you think that the writers of Goldfinger intended for Pussy Galore to consent to that sexual encounter? Yes, they were arguing and even fighting beforehand. But that sort of thing is commonplace in James Bond stories. He encounters a woman that is more or less his enemy. They belittle each other at first, but also feel a certain admiration and attraction for each other. She baits him, resulting in his capture or another setback. In a later encounter, the attraction gets the better of them, and they forget they are enemies for a night.  Have to say though, I wouldn't have shot the scene in a way that made people question if she consented or not, doesn't seem like a great idea.
I will wait patiently for the episode titled "ContraPoints Magical Music Hour" to be released. His fingers can do amazing things. With musical instruments. Or maybe more, I don't know, it's not really any of my business. But I do like it when he plays the guitar or piano.
Maybe the wording "rape culture" makes sense in a context where academics are writing books for other academics who will keep reading, but the left needs to realize just how hyperbolic and unreasonable this phrase sounds in a public context. When you come right out of the gates with "*RAPE* culture!", the predictable response is "That's ridiculous. Who condones rape!?", and lefties are immediately shifted to arguing apologetics for seemingly outrageous accusations rather than discussing anything productive. We absolutely should reflect critically on our sexual culture, but when it sounds like you're assuming ill will on everyone who doesn't already share your views and instantly going 0 to "literally Hitler", you make yourself easy to dismiss as unreasonable.
jfc Contra, 6 empty beers to the left and hard stuff to the right... DM me when you need a liver transplant
this, along with the Freddie Gray video, was my favorite of yours when I first discovered your content. If you're still remaking old videos only better and while being the right gender, I'd love to put in a request for this one!
What the fuck was that Reddit thread
Can't stop laughing every time you bow to the Sarkeesian Dark Mother Altar. I love your videos
I really could have used your lecture on scabies. Too late now!
11:30 - Love, havent you seen Skyfall? I recall seeing it in cinemas back in the day in the US and, BLIMEY, the second Bond goes on to sneak into the girl's shower, without her consent, RIGHT AFTER A SCENE OF HER TELLING THE STORY OF HOW SHE WAS SOLD TO BLOODY SEX TRAFFICKERS, everyone in the movie theater audibly when "WTF!?"  I'm just surprised you didn't mention this one as it is also a 007, and from just a few years ago.  Cheers.
I only watch your videos for the music
Hey what's wrong with Logicked?  Sure he aims low but he's rather nice to the targets of his videos generally.  Maybe you watched some older stuff I'm not familiar with, but his recent videos are pretty funny and uncontroversial.
Omg that bond clip.
Ugh, you have a picture of Ayaan Hirsi Ali when you say "Troglodytes on Youtube", jesus christ dude.
It’s pretty clear that the US has a strong anti-rape culture, but that there’s room for further improvement.  There was no argument here that rape culture exists and not even a rebuttal of the weird internet dudes. Contra is looking at the “room for improvement” and the shitlords are looking at the obvious falsity of the original claim.   Can’t we all be friends?
Probably shouldnt use the term shitlord, goes against what your trying to do here.
What does Chinese society mean? Very vague term as well.
Holy fucking shit at the James Bond scene.
You are so funny and smart and I love your videos.  Please keep up the good work!
This is amazing. Thank you so much for being so well spoken, informed and putting your talents to such good use. I love that you and your videos exist. You give me hope. I love you.
Holy shit your ending was amazing! Great video :) I'll send my dick picks in a bit <3
You have not presented any evidence that rape is 1. Commonly done in our society and 2. Commonly accepted in our society. So I call bullshit.
Ok, bear with me here. I think Brock Turner is in denial with regards to consent, as well as those reddit forums. Wouldn't most of these non-murder rapists be considered sociopaths because they have no empathy or understanding of morality? Did Brock Turner really not understand that fucking an unconscious woman= consent? If he didn't understand that his actions were rape, why did he bring her hidden behind a dumpster? That's why only issue with your argument with regards to consent. However I agree with a lot of your points! I used to be a die hard anti-feminist but now my political ideology has mellowed down. I agree when you state that rape culture is found in these "mini-cultures" and not necessarily perpetrated in the whole country. I think this is the line where feminists and shitlords are at a discord. Feminists sice the prevalence of "Rape culture" while shitlords downplay it. I love your channel
Is Anita Sarkeesian the Refrigerator mother?
Want a rape culture?! Advocate for more Islamic immigration  Closing Frat houses won’t stop rape 🤪
JFC, the first 5 seconds made me laugh way harder than they should have.
Cold mother.
Personally, I think that rape culture exists to some extent in some subcultures, some of which I am admittedly a part of, but I think that like a lot of words progressives tend to use, "rape culture" is a word so divisive that anyone accused of being a part of one is almost automatically inflamed into defensiveness. It's human nature to a certain extent. It takes dignified explanations like yours to calm people down, but a better idea is to have the term be less vague in the first place. I would suggest "rape ignorance" or "rape blindness"
You have some good points, but I think you fail to follow through on the idea that rapists aren't monsters. If you're going to say that people who commit rape are decent people who are misinformed, then it follows that legal policy on rape needs to be focused on reeducation and reform, not destroying people's lives.
I dont think its really fair to compare drugs to rape though. There are no discussions being had by people in general and in the political arena about legalizing rape, the benefits of legalizing rape, or people thinking rape is cool. People dont normally talk about going to a party last weekend and "raping " in the way they brag about doing a line of coke or smoking weed. The general consensus among the vast majority of people I would assume to be that rape is bad, rapists are some of the inmates that are treated the worst in prison too. I dont really think the word rape CULTURE is very fair to use. More like a minority of assholes thinking rape is ok? But thats my impression from Norway . I have never lived in America. I dont think the entirety of America is a rape culture, but I think there exists rape cultures within certain "cultures" of America, mainly on college campuses.   And Robin Thickes song "I know you want it" might not be accosiated to rape at all, its could be about a girl wanting sex but being "a good girl" (which is maybe more slut shaming than anything? good girls dont have sex etc). So I dont really know if thats a good example.   But other than that, its refreshing to see a different take on things, even though I might not 100% agree. Youtube has become a bit of an echochamber on certain topics and issues. Always nice to challenge ones own way of thinking, and seeing things from a different perspective.
you're playing Pokemon blue when you could be playing yellow or red ? smh...
Contapoints briefly turns into Mr.plinket 2:53.
Japan still has a giant issue with rape culture, you can very clearly see this in their media where almost every single romance involves a man forcing himself onto a women and the stupid idea that "I'm so good she will start to want it". This is very worrying to me especially since people have started to accept this line of thinking where I live (Canada) and its.....just.....wrong. If I ever even managed to have sex (which based on how fat I am is unlikely) I could never live with myself if I knew that there was even a 1% chance that my parter didn't really want it, and the fact that this is fetishized and encouraged in places like fraternities and Japanese media really worries me. Wow I really lost my train of thought there and just ended up ranting, lol.
Oh no... not THE BLACKS! *dunn dunn dunnnnn*
It’s too bad you didn’t address the elephant in the room of WHAT IS RAPE.   In society today, if two drunk heterosexual college students have sex, the male is a rapist. Period. Whether or not the woman presses charges.   So when someone puts up a sign that reads “RAPE IS RAPE” you can see how that deserves some legitimate push back.
When I was 14 a police officer came into our personal social education classroom and told us about consent and sexual assault.
For a moment, I thought I was watching a Mr. Plinkett review.
****11:00** Yeah, these old movies depicting rape scenes without any objection make me cringe.**
You're like if Mr. Plinkett was a SJW   I love it.
0:18 omfg i just realise the chinese words on the picture frame actually means "Mao Zedong, a great man" Contra where the hell did you get this photo frame??
12:32 - out of interest what shit has Bill Maher said on rape?
The shutdown of the "ask a rapist" on manipulative, thought control grounds was especially shameful. Shutting it down was first and foremost a way to deny the rapists' perspective and deny they exist, how the fuck are you going to solve this problem if you don't know how it works. I think the thought control police are worst offenders than most every day rapists. If anything, they make the problem last much longer than it needs to.  Here's my solution to avoid any rape ever, when it comes to the opposite sex, do not speak to them unless spoken to and when it comes to sex, it never happens without a notarized letter of consent signed by both parties and each a witness. (And of course, the only acceptable way to ask for sex is to publicly proclaim "I would like sex" and then saying yes or no to each person that asks about your request, no more innuendo or misunderstanding possible). Finally, just make all rape and sex crime of any kind punishable by death on the spot.    There, I fucking fixed it !
I applaud your choice of scotch.
Gross. I remember that bond scene playing on tv once and I was commenting on it. My dad defended it with hand-waving because bond will be bond etc... Makes me feel sick.
I love how he never fails to make sure that bottles of alcohol are seen all over his place :-) Other than that, another piece of good material.
This needs an update since all the allegations that has come out of Hollywood and being a possible rapist didn't hamper Donald Trump's chances of becoming president
The thing with education in an institutionalized setting where marks are given based on how much you learned about not raping is not very effective (imho). Kids often ignore or even detest any form of teaching and pass the message of not raping the same as the message that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell; not as a moral decision but rather as something to remember for the next test.
Love how you glossed over Jezebel, who reveled in beating their BFs in an article.
This seemed light on evidence compared to your other videos. Do countries without frats have fewer rapes, for example? And your analogy with pedophillia and 'fetishising youth' didn't work for me; guys like girls in their late teens and early twenties because they're most fertile, this is not equivalent to pedophilia. Have rapes decreased since the feminist message has become more mainstream? We'd have trouble separating rate of rape vs rate of reporting
Check how Robin Thicke ended up being condemned and 'changing his message.' It shows the discrepancy between the cultural messages and thoughts, and mainstream intolerance and the attitude of PURE AWEFULNESS OF THE SOUL to unsuccessfully try and fix the problematic people.  On genius, he submitted his own analysis of the lyrics:  I feel so lucky, you wanna hug me/What rhymes with hug me? = "Love me" What do they make dreams for/When you got them jeans on = Most of my dreams—that I enjoy or want to remember—are about get-togethers with my friends, family, and people I’ve known my whole life. Everybody is there and everybody is happy and doing well. It’s some version of heaven.
I think what a more than a year later has taught people is that it hasnt gotten better just gotten better at hiding it
Damn, playing slide with a shot glass? That's is inventive, I must say. I'd probably go home from the hospital and immediately shoot myself if I broke my first finger on my left hand. Your way is better.
I get that some rapists genuinely do have messed up beliefs about sex that they were taught by society but I’m still not entirely comfortable with this idea that rapists are just normal guys that simply didn’t know any better ( which is precisely something I’ve heard a radical feminist say at one point, if you can believe it). Have we forgotten that malignant narcissists exist? These are people that will NEVER take any responsibility for their behaviour. By all means, teach consent in sex ed - don’t give them any excuses to say “I didn’t know that was rape!”- but don’t expect these people to change.
"The people who argue that rapists know that rape is wrong have a bad theory about the psychology of rapists." I don't think the problem is a lack of understanding of the rapists psychology, but rather the fact that these definitely-not-rape-apologists consider these situations as not actually rape, because they share that exact mindset. It's almost like this is a wider societal problem. If only there was a term for this kind of normalisation of sexual violence...
You sound like Rick Steves in this one.  : )
old ContraPoints videos are underrated
The year and about a half since this video was uploaded has been interesting.
Even thought i'm pretty to the right, this video further proves my point that we need both left and right wing perspectives to tackle certain problems like rape. Great stuff!
Omg.... Are you from Maryland? Did my state get more cool?!?!?
No no means until it means yes
When women say no they mean maybe. If she doesn't want it she'll display it with obvious body language and physical resistance. Women should be taught how to react to these situations. As you've said a lot of rapists think their victims wanted it, this tells me that they're not committing rape with melicious intent. If these perpetrators are unaware of the harm they're committing then shouldn't the woman be responsible for preventing this situation? If she does so and he continues then I'd say it's not under the "teach men not to rape" scenario. I remember years ago that feminists were always claiming that men committed rape as an act of power rather than passion, this makes no sense with all the talk of consent classes teaching men not to rape.
Respectfully, I feel like your argument about sexy women in media is countered with every slut walk that ever was. And stop show TJ's picture in a negative context god dammit!
"baby im saw-ry"
Thank you for pronouncing Appalachian correctly ❤️
If I Time Travel to The Past and I Rape Myself - Is it Still Rape? If Future Me Chooses to Have Sex with Past Me - Even Though Past Me does not Consent but Future Me does - Is It still Consent?
Word Crimes > Blurred Lines
3:45 "One toke, man!"  You're fuckin... really... a cool person.... ContraPoints person. Thanks for bein... fuckin cool.
Interesting how included the James Bond clip because many women are pretty and hate the new way of consent because they want strong males that show them that they really want them and if you fist need to say yes it's totally lame, it was much better when women had to fight back to actually call it rape.
Is there a reason why you're speaking so fast? Trying to be like Camille Paglia?
Beautiful
Does Dance Moms promote rape culture?
4:18 "On one hand we see rape as something evil, on the other hand.." and then you put the blurred lines video. I legit don't see your point. How does it endorse rape? How do we "fetishize" youth? You had a pretty long video to show proof of what you're claiming, and yet you haven't done it once. There is no rape culture in the west. There's just people that love virtue signaling and people that profit from it, like yourself. Gotta love that youtube money. And I wouldn't even mind if by doing so you wouldn't make the society worse. But you're aggravating the conflict between left and right. You're making people hate each other, you're making women hate men and men hate women. You guys are just agitators paid by advertisement money and virtue signaling at the end of the day. Get your shit together and find a real job.
That James Bond clip is actually a pretty perfect example of rape culture in media - much stronger than what's read into 'Blurred Lines' and other modern examples.
also knifing a few rapists would bring numbers down ...take scalps.
Brilliant and clear. As usual.
"Can you teach thieves not to steal?" - Man who has never read a book on capitalism in his """"""""rational skeptical"""""""" life.
Holy shit dude you look like a man lmao
Of course rapists are gonna deny that rape is bad and they're evil, they lie! PD: Progressivism is not always the answer.
yes i will agree, some aspects of rape culture does exist with in our society. tho the biggest problem with the claim of rape culture is fauls rape claims on innocent men which mostly happens in fraps. and as for sex/frap culture, some women also take part in the process of indecent behavour with no rules or boundaries which is problematic because that does make it a little risky and allows both rapists and rape accuses to flourish but i would not say that sex culture relates to rape culture as it does not encourage rape culture. now blured lines, that song is not about rape, its about the singer trying to convince the "nice girl" stereo type that sex is not wrong as some feminist and christains tend to have this negative view of slutty behavour and demonize sex. i can see the misconceptions but if you take a look at the lyrics you will see.
I think the criticism of feminists when it comes to rape culture is often to do with specifics. A feminist will say a specific thing is rape culture when that specific thing is fine. Then someone will call them stupid for it. Even things like the "rapebait" email aren't as bad as they seem. (this is like taking material from a comedy club and sharing it with a straight face. Tone matters, don't be a fuckwit.) Some feminists talk about rape as though they've never had or wanted sex and that the idea of anyone wanting anything remotely risque is completely impossible. These people tend to see rape culture where normal people see sex culture. And it's harder than you think to untangle these two.    Also, positive consent education is mint. Positive consent laws aren't.
I foumd this one year too late.
You earned my subscription with "off the hook" and the anal hook.
Best fucking channel on youtube ever. If this doesn't influence opinions, I don't know what will
An interesting question to ask oneself is _when_ seduction turns into rape, to really specify it, because I don't think it's always as obvious as it may seem at a first glance.  Seduction is by definition to take a person who currently don't want to be intimate with you and make them want to. Sometimes this is straight forward and everyone is happy, but what if say, someone is drunk, you make yourself out to be something you are not or you manipulate your subject emotionally, to pick three methods used by lots of people (men and women)? All of those are immoral if used too much, but generally seen as okay:ish if used a bit. Is this just a gray area?
Shit, I just got educated.
How about this. Rape culture affects men more than women. Or rather the rape culture affecting men affects them more intense than the separate rape culture that affects women
Upvote for Laphroaig!
More strawmen and infantilizing of women. Good job.
More mind reading. God you suck.
This man is the man of my dreams! They do exist! Why only on YouTube? 😭
Baby i'm sorry
Its interesting to follow your videos to hear someone defending something like this we all have heard so much about.  Many subjects i have studied in great detail, thou i came to another conclusion then Contrapoints, even though it is really interesting to hear what the other side has to say too.
You proved America isn't a rape culture. Nobody glorifies rape and rapist go to prison. Yes rape is terrible and I do wish would never happen. But your idea of reducing rape is through what exactly? Shut down porn sites. Shut down offensive music. Shut down movies and offensive ads and shows. Shut down offensive language. You are trying very hard to make a point for rape culture, but it's not there.
I have never resonated with a youtube channel so much. I really love your videos. :)
I want cheese
Impressive.
Bill Maher and Richard Dawkins are both very pro-feminist
Brilliant. You are humorous, insightful, and objective in critiquing a topic without losing sight of humanity or demonizing 'the other'.
"off the hook"  Perfect choice of picture ^.^
Contra, I fucking love your videos. Such a breath of fresh air on YouTube. Smarter that the lot of the "skeptics" combined.
I have never thought about it from this perspective before. Interesting.
Wow. The point about complaining for a long time until eventually society changes really put some things into a new perspective for me.
I think that rape is the worst thing you can do to a person. Victims often describe "losing everything", losing their sense of who they are and their connection to the rest of humanity.
I think that if someone said _"We should teach them what rape is"_ and not _"We should teach them not to rape",_ people will be more willing to agree.
ah Laphroaig,  you have such good taste Contrapoints!  love all your work, keep it up!!!
Shout out to all the feminised men and men pretending to be girls in the comment box.
Consent is a wildly simple concept. If you are not sure, ask. If they say no at any point, STOP. If you misjudge the situation and violate someones consent, STOP and APOLOGIZE.
Thank you!!! This is brilliant
0.09sec.....  Nice choice- Laphroaig. A personal favourite of mine, too. (Along with Highland Park, Lagavoulin, Glenmorangie, Glenfiddich and Macallan.... of course! And the grandest of them all, Ladyburn -the 42yr)  Love your videos, Contra!  Keep up the awesome work, much love, K
i feel like you kind of shrugged off the alcohol issue with a joke, and it may not have been necessary to focus on it deeply in this video, but there's some pretty pervasive and whack ideas on how alcohol affects people *coughcough*men who are nearly blackout drunk somehow have any more agency over their actions than women in the same state*cough*. Also not to mention your point on fraternities entirely skips over frat houses being notoriously fueled by inappropriate and sometimes deadly levels of alcohol consumption, which honestly probably has more to do with their use of alcohol in raping young women than the fanciful narrative that these boys are thoroughly brainwashed by hazing rituals. Sure that may be part of it. But I bet you my bank account that getting hard liquor forced down their skulls on a daily bases does most of the work. Alcohol is a fucking jackhammer to the id. People have a serious lack of comprehension towards how it affects the way they see the world. I know the majority of the population isn't very self-aware when it comes to how alcohol effects them (believe it or not it does way WAY more damage to you than the liver damage meme) but hey that's a lot like rape culture itself isn't it! "Haha lol I'm such an alcoholic" buzzfeed level jokes are about as far away as one can get about being self-aware in regards to ones relationship with alcohol. I'm not saying alcohol is the reason people rape, or even that Brock Turner shouldn't have been convicted for what he did, but laughing it off is grossly disingenuous and directly in line with an alcohol culture that is just as dangerous and widespread as rape culture. Good video otherwise.
this guy is where is at, love your arguments
you should watch spring awakening (the deaf west version)
every time you post a new video I get sucked into your channel and I have to watch all of your videos again
well that bond scene was disgusting
God damn that intro, hahaha.
Feminists cant enjoy anything, and will try to find everything they can  to ruin popular culture. I think its funny how you took a supposed moral high ground in this video, as if you were on the right side of history. Political correctness had its stay but has gone to far, and i think you know that. That's why more and more people are going against everything you stand for each and everyday. Men are tired of being considered rapist, and Women are tired of having to conform to YOUR standards. The left get taken less and less seriously, and its about time. Counter culture will have its day soon, you'll see.
But let's be honest: many feminists invite the hostile reactions they receive by lacing their talking points with overt hostility of their own.  If you begin your YouTube video with "all white people are racist and all men are misogynistic," a lot of white straight males will naturally get defensive over it. Ditto for statements like "all PIV is rape" and "jokes" like "sorry, it's a boy."  I mean, I consider myself to be a pretty liberal and tolerant guy, by and large, but hearing all of these casual slurs get repeated over and over can still get me pretty roiled up on occasion.   Is that really so surprising?
Teach men not to rape...how do you decide who is man and who is not? There are women who look like Danielle Muscato.
"I have been drunk since 2008 and I never raped anyone." Right after you finish discussing how most rapists do not think of themselves as rapists. Hmm!  Yes, that was a joke. About rape. I'm with George Carlan on this issue.  Do you want to feel even more awkward about that James Bond scene? In the original novel Pussy Galore is explicitly a lesbian until Bond apparently rapes her straight, _and_ she was molested as a child.
This is literally the first rape culture video that doesn't have 99.999997H+J67H&K99 % dislikes
U are a man
I wish I had known you switched channels earlier! Happy for you! Love your stuff!
I come from New Zealand, and in my high school (and intermediate school I think) we were taught about consent and how very important it is, hell consent is one of my favourite words, but yet my country has really bad rape statistics. I guess my point is that minority's or Muslims or Jews are someone who doesn't look just like me is to blame.
so I can die easy..... well well well
i wonder what anita sarkeesian thinks of this
Lemme build a strawman out of skeptic arguments and create a video around it. Disingenuous fuck.
I think this is the most well-reasoned take on "rape culture" and "teach men not to rape" that I've ever heard.  If all feminists just said this, there would be no anti-sjw: "there is a large number of men raping blackout drunk women who clam to not have known it was rape. If even some of them are genuine in what they're saying, it would be beneficial to have a discussion about consent in sex ed classes in school".  But when we hear "all men are rapists, teach men not to rape", "we live in a rape culture and women are in constant fear of being raped", it's hard to not have a knee-jerk reaction and dismiss feminism as crazy.  BTW, could you make a similar video about patriarchy? I would love to know more about the reasonable aspects of that idea.
Love that the thinking is nuanced, the focus not on being stupidly logical, but on humanly reasonable.
about time. First time I hear an opinion about rape culture I don't necessarily agree to but is not absolutely bonkers.
I'm loving your videos! I'm so glad that Philosophy Tube brought me here
8:50 What is this madness ? Yeah maybe well never put an end to rape, might be true but neither will we put an end to murder yet we try to prevent is as good as possible. Is sargon actually braindead ?
god i forgot how douchey sargon of akkad sounds whenever he talks.
I love you CP, you are helping me come to terms with my weird sexuality :3
7:00  -Rape apologists- """rashunul skeptuks""": men can't control themselv--  Me: *STOP RIGHT THERE, CRIMINAL SCUM!* No one talks about men like that on _my_ watch. I'm confiscating your Men's Rights Activism card, now say you're sorry or it's off to misandry jail!
Every thing is sexist
you used very specific, individual examples. this is not very good evidence. further more, pointing out the thoughts of rapists themselves does not mean that a lot of people share them. thieves have justifications in their actions, that does not mean a lot of people believe these justifications. and the boyish behaviour of fraternities is, again, not causing rape culture, you provided no statistical evidence for this. playing pranks on friends does not, for any sane person, encourage unwarranted sexual behaviour.
PREACH! thanks for this video, glad i found this channel.
2:02 is it sexist for me to prefer the type 3 vagina over the other 2?
Oh my god I'm so happy this channel exist.
You talk about shitlords and show a picture of tf, aa, etc and how they argue that we already teach men not to rape and no more is necessary. You then go ahead and claim that "they", referring to the shitlords from what I understand, say that we only have options like "dressing like nuns" or "staying at home". I highly doubt that those individuals claim that this should be the way to go. Yet you make it sound like they do. I enjoy your videos and listening to your perspective. But stuff like this gives everything sort of a sour taste.
2:18 I'm Australian and I find this hilarious
Nice cover of "In My Time of Dying". I mean, I also liked the content too but it's just not something I would expect you to do in a video about Rape Culture.
I am not sure if it is your impeccable taste in scotch or your humor but I can't help but like you. You make me almost not hate feminists as much...
Rape culture is fake.
rape culture a term made up to maintain feminist narrative & fear
Good video.
Oh that's so cool. I love Led Zeppelin!
Not satisfied with being younger, smarter and more educated than me, and dare I say sexier, but you play the fucking guitar too! Damn you Contra, damn you!
Rape culture is fucking harmful as shit, especially for victims  And all that bullshit about "how to avoid being raped" is useless as most sexual assaults and rapes are committed by someone known to the victim and are not strangers in public places pulling someone by their pony tail (unlike that bullshit article making the rounds online claiming to be sourced from convicted sex offenders in incarceration for their offences)
Let's ban fraternities. I have heard a bunch of bad stuff about them on the media, not to mention I am not in a fraternity myself.  Let's also ban cross dressing. I have heard a bunch of bad stuff about it on the media, not to mention I am not a cross dresser.  I am on board with so many of your points, but then you slip bullshit stuff like this in ever so often when you take your mental short cuts.
I have heard of your channel from Kat Blaque's stream, your videos are awesome ! :D
*pauses at 2:03 for 15 secs * Thats horrible
I hear a lot more common sense here than I expected to, I will concede that right off the bat. You have not convinced me, in any way however, that there is any justification in using a term like "rape culture" in Western societies. Your claims about protesting too much ring hallow in the face of the society constantly being accused of being a rape culture.  If one is under continuous accusation it is utterly facetious to claim such projection is at work.  You are obliging a defense to be mounted.  Regarding your claims that rapists are simply let go with a finger waved in their face, that is absurd.  You cite one case where the rapist was wealthy.  Rich people get away with EVERYTHING.  All the time.  This is about the privilege of wealth and nothing more—claiming that it is peculiar to rape cases is absurd on its face.  Now, before I get the inevitable: "You are a man thus have no right to speak on this issue, you filthy, cis, heteronormative, monster" response that has become so common as to be trite, let me say I was molested 4 to 5 times a week between the ages of 8 and 11, meaning I was raped approximately 702 times which, IMHO, gives me some small claim to an opinion on the matter. I am the last person in the world to excuse rape or take it lightly given the long-term harm it inflicted on my life. You have simply failed to convince me of anything here we didn't all agree on to start with. My impression of this video is that you are trying to give moral cover to one of the more grotesque aspects of feminism to eliminate it as a valid target of criticism. Duke, Colombia, UVA, that twitchy bitch with the mattress... You'll find few people walking this earth with more contempt for frat boys then I but how many college rape scandals have we been treated to over the years that have turned out to be complete fabrications?  I absolutely and whole-heartedly believe in equality of rights and opportunity but I am equally convinced that feminism, taken in balance, is pretty fucking malignant.  This is the fate of any advocacy group in the end.  No matter how righteous in cause or legitimate in grievance it may be to start with, once the last true dragon has been slain it invariably begins the long slide into a supremacy movement.  One last point, your implications of racism against Sargon are wholly unjustified and you should be authentically ashamed of leveling them.
The Brock Turner thing is interesting too because there were male witnesses. If there weren't, the whole thing would probably have only been noticed by a small number of people. I would have never heard his name.
was this blurred lines guy really the best example? for rape! in modern western culture ????
I agree.
that james bond thing was fucking crazy
I feel like the more I watch the videos, the more I can just go "I think the thesis of this video is that freedom is complicated," and that's basically about it. Of course, I also watch the videos for Contra, so that's a plus.
The problem is that if we follow this line of thought we end up on the other side of the feminist mirror: Andrea Dworkin. If you don't know the quote, here it is:  "Seduction is often difficult to distinguish from rape. In seduction, the rapist often bothers to buy a bottle of wine"  Either we consider rape as being strictly vaginal penetration against EXPLICIT denial of acess to the vagina, as the FBI used to on their official definition which is now called "legacy rape" (I kid you not), or we start increasing the scope of the term to anal penetration, oral penetration, many forms of sexual abuse, under any circumstance where the female is not 100% sober, has signed a proper consent form and has an IQ over 90 at least.   Any other situation can be portrayed as a rape under the "revised" rad-feminist definition if you have enough rhetorical ability (something top OG feminist never lack), which is why I despise this concept. I agree it is good as a weapon to accuse people and "fight the patriarchy" (not really, its actually good to promote puritanism and protect the virginity of your daughter if you're a good Patriarch), it is a very strong harassement tool since rape is literally the worst crime a person can commit (most people see rape as unjustifiable no matter what, even under war, but murder of the enemy is fine if you are at war). But to explain everything it wants to explain, the concept is not good. It blurs too many things together under one single causal element : culture. "rape is a social construct".  Let's take the scene from james bond, for instance. That specific "game of rape" that happens is part of many cultures in very similar forms (mundugumor people comes to mind, as described by Margaret Mead), and when something is repeated many times in many communities without contact with each other, there might be something more than mere culture.   What I mean to say is this:  If we take the whole rape spectrum as one simple thing, without any nuances, we cannot understand why this happens. It is a complex ritual where the woman has agency.   It is reasonable for women to despise cowards. This is a test of cowardice. But it is also reasonable to despise monsters, and this is also a test for monsters: the men is expected to use moderate force, and to withstand the attack from the female without responding with full force. This is why the man mostly holds the female, but never hits her, and at the same time, he gets hit and has to take those hits.   The second point is that what is called here "rape culture" and "blaming the victim" is in fact a "provocation culture". As Derrida points out in his book about Nietzsche and Women (its actually a conference, I forgot the name), the feminine power is distinguished by "distance", or how it is a "long range power". Provocation is in fact a distinct characteristic of feminine beauty and if we try to ignore this element and "blame" everything on the accused rapist, we miss the point. The point is precisely how complicated it is to try and legislate over a complicated matter such as this one.  So we don't want "rape culture" to end because it would mean the end of seduction, the end of sexual provocation, the end of BDSM and of most human "sex games". If we had our rape culture taken away by feminists, we would replace it with a new inverted rape culture most probably (with the men being abused by the female, something that is kinkier than the void which would be left by the "consent form" sexual meta-game). Then MRAs would probably take it away and we would end up with sex robots or something   gg thanks for the vid
8:49 Not with that attitude.
Dude whats with the accent.
God dam, that James Bond is an asshole.  Just look what he is willing to do to subvert the plans of a potential murderer.  Why couldn't men of that time respect a women's choice to murder them and then to lead a group of women pilots to flight a deadly gas attack over a bank to rob some gold.  Shameful, if only Pussy Galore wasn't held back by the stereotypes of the day.
Hey contra...I've just discovered you as a result of your debate with Blaire White...and have now spent the last week devouring every video you've done. Thank you for putting into words a feeling ok be had for a while that although SJW rhetoric can be preachy and annoying at times eventually the positive aspects to start to change society as a result of being preachy and annoying :)
I've never heard your theory on the rape culture of some frats before...I was part of greek life and I never thought about it that way. Keep up the great work!
YES! THANK YOU! LEGITIMATE alternative points of view of the current YouTube mob WITHOUT falling into extreme Leftism!
or an aunt
"rape culture" is that a culture that A.incourages rape B.teaches (males) to rape C. accepts rape as normal D. does not prosocute convicted rapists.?   Ok to be honest with D, In my opnion, yes there are individuals that have been found guilty which seem to serve little or no time.  This is a problem with the justice system however and not culture in general.  I for one dont know anyone whose parent(s) taught or told them that is ok to rape someone.  There is an issue with rapes not going reported for various reasons and so perhaps this is why men "get away with it" due to potential repurcussions to a woman and her social/economic/employed status.  Again than this would be an issue of women allowing the rapist(s) to "go free" not society just being ok with rape.  THE sign reading Dont Rape...again WHO is being told to rape or that it is ok?  No male with a a mother, daughter, sister or niece would just turn an eye to their female family member being raped.  They wouldnt just sit there and say "go ahead shes just a female".. nor do any of the men I know think "hey I could just rape her and no one would care...yeah thats cool".  If they do than they are a total asshole that has some serious issues and apparntly wasnt raised with any kind of morals.
Thanks for the video. I think you are very shortsighted in some of your conclusions. You cherrypick examples and you exempt the evil that overall good movements such as feminism has created whilst bashing good people such as Sargon for some opinions which they have said. With that said, everyone can have their own opinions, and I liked some of yours. Have a good day.
Plus you dont seem to know alot abut sociopaths and how they operate...
REALLY bad analogy nick. Drugtaking and rape are SOO different...In what they are and their effects on individuals and society...
So I  wonder  how  many  nudes he got?
I'm not and never will claim that rape doesn't happen, or that rapists aren't typically horrible people (we'll leave aside for a moment the ones that are drunk or stoned at the time. In those cases, I don't think either party was consenting) but I DO have a problem with the idea that rape is in any way celebrated in any sort of popular culture in the western world. The example of a fraternity is a specific incident and should certainly be taken seriously. The examples of women (and men) getting sexually assaulted on campuses is mortifying (even if it's not the number that is often quoted). But these don't indicate a "rape culture" where, as was stated, rape is normalized or excused. I DO agree with your statement that "feminism is cancer" is certainly negative as not all feminist ideals are bad. The problem occurs that the ones that you see, hear about, or are made famous, DO have some poisonous attitudes. The same way that I refuse to laud all MRAs, but the bad apples don't change the GOOD arguments and GOOD points that are made. The problem that most people (myself included) as far as I can understand - HAVE with feminism is that it's exclusionary. It claims to be about justice and fairness for all, but has the section "fem" in it and specifies in it's definition that it's a movement for justice and equality for women. When it's for all people, I'll get behind it, but it won't be for all people with that specificity added in. The same way I disagree with people that scream "RACISM" or "SEXISM" or "TRANSPHOBIA" or any of the other buzzwords. They are one word and one word only: PREJUDICE. Until you stop separating prejudices down into each individual type, you will find it happening. If you insist on making women's issues a topic, then men's issues must be a topic (they're not, because that would get you lynched online). If BLM is important, then so are Asian lives and Arab lives and Latino lives and on and on. By separating the movement into only looking at one fragment, you are creating the type of segregation that black people spent centuries fighting against! By insisting that only women's issues be addressed, you're creating the type of segregation that women have been fighting against!
You are hilarious.
Excellent, you think for yourself. You seem to have a very balanced point of view and you look very nice in your lady outfits. Keep it up: It's refreshing!!
You include Aayann Ali as a 'shitlord'?? One of this videos many many flaws.
Woooohh wait... what? Adam Lyons? The guy I see every year at the Bicolline LARP in Canada and the guy who has two girlfriends? Damn. What a coincidence you mention someone I know from totally different spheres of subjects.
I appreciate your love of scotch.
I agree with a lot here, I do agree that NO ONE really learns what does or should happen pre-sex other than "wear a condom plz." So there could be better education of how to approach it. However, I also agree with Camille Paglia on the point that sex is a grey, messy area. Like if two people start kissing, it escalates, they start taking each others clothes off, sex occurs, well...was that concievably rape if no one said out right said "You're cool with boning right now, right?" It seems that even without the "clear verbal communication," consensual sex was agreed to by both parties. And was there alcohol involved.......this can be a much more grey area than I think people want it to be.
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I disagree. Brock Turner's father is disgusting. There's nothing "understandable" about that, Comrade ContraPoints. I would disown any rapist relative.
Blame it on sadomasochistic hazing, but do you really want to know why fraternities are such bastions of rape culture? Because they're sex segregated. From Catholic clergy to military barracks, any all-male space will hopelessly degenerate into sexism.
Female genital mutilation does occur in the West, namely in isolated immigrant communities. I'm not against immigration at all; quite the contrary. I just think that we as a society should do a better job at educating, accommodating and integrating these communities.
Your satire is hysterical. I dont have to agree with you to enjoy you. I will kindly leave it at that.=)
Killing it again! You rock
Calling it "rape culture" probably isn't making any friends. For example violence is a heavy part of culture but I wouldn't call American culture "violence culture". Just like any other issue it requires nuance, some things are more common than others etc. So use apt definitions, avoid generalisations, don't hijack terms (see racism), don't take extremist stances... :)
UUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMMM...... I'm aroused woops
Hey, do you mind if I use that clip on the "exaggerated horror we reserve for an extreme idea of rape helps to provide cover for more common every-day rape" in a video? It's about the dangers of dehumanising evil, and this quote is very close to one of my main points.
I don't think that you can compare drug culture to "rape culture". while drugs are accepted by society, or at least my A LOT of people, rape definitely isn't. Sexualized videos are NOT incouraging rape, it's encouraging sex, but not rape. And yeah, rapist may not think that they were raping, but they are the only ones that think so. A person who rapes is a sick person, no wonder they misinterpret a womens signals. The vast majority disagrees with these sick people. there is no rape culture.
Huh. You're becoming a favorite
Right-wing: "There's rape in Africa and Muslim countries" Left-wing: "You haven't done shit to help those African and Muslim women" Right-wing: Duh...uh..*pisses themselves* The left is INTOLERANT!!!
Recently found you! Love your blues references!
I see that magic hat summer brew two minutes in 😍
6:25 Why would you take the word of a rapist? Why wouldn't you assume they are trying to rationalize their behavior?  9:05 Jesus. No one talks like this, at least not shit lords. You may not lie about your opposition, but can't but you can't help engaging in gross exaggerations.  I guess it's not your fault lefty, you people can't help it. Subscribed. :)
man I wish I didn't like you. everyone on youtube I like was telling me not to. that you were crazy and dumb. but i love your sense of humor, you're obviously an intellectual and very well spoken with a masters to back it up. i wasn't even going to give you a chance, I wanted to see your videos because you were attractive in Blaires debate and really seemed pretty smart. I ended up watching 4 of your videos last night and really liking them.  from an "anti sjw community" member,  you've well earned my sub. thank you contra. BTW, I take my first sentence back. What I meant to say was, I WISH I DIDN'T LISTEN TO OTHERS OPINION ON YOU AND MISS OUT ON YOUR CHANNEL FOR TWO YEARS BECAUSE OF IT. That will be the last time I ever do that. Ever.
Harambe will never be forgotten, neither will rapist Brock Turner.
1 in 4 women are sexually molested at least once in their lifetime, 1 in 6 men. I'd say that qualifies as a rape culture.
"You end up having to apologise for something you never agreed to in the first place." VERY well said. Here's to more of it.
This has nothing to do with rape culture.
I think the phrase RAPE CULTURE is extremely loaded and straight away puts anyone who doesn't believe its an issue in a defensive position unwilling to compromise because "we dont have a society/culture that endorses rape". The wording needs to change before people will engage in conversation PERIOD. Saying we need more "education on consent" or something along those lines would be much more conducive to discourse.
Please don't equate rape culture with drug culture. You're comparing the least cool, most morally repugnant thing ever with one of the 'coolest' things ever. I happen to think that many people who have literally killed people probably are not total monsters and might even be agreeable if you were to talk to them. This does infer that western murder culture is rife!
You make lot of very great points, but I don't feel that using Dennis from it's always sunny in Philadelphia is probably the best example. All of the characters in that show are HORRIBLE people and the entire point of the show is that they are horrible and lack morals. I understand what you were trying to do with that clip, but when put into context, it doesn't make sense. But other than that, you make many great points. I really love your content and I'm excited to see even more videos from you! ♥️
totally missed the point again. ahhhhh! so frustrating!
Sick guitar playing at the end, too! (Love Led Zeppelin)
That scene in James Bond isn't just rape, it's raping a woman straight since Galore is a lesbian. Corrective rape is genuinely believed by millions of men. "All women really want men, my dick is just special enough to get so-called lesbians to realize it" is a depressingly common viewpoint.
You skipped over the easiest possible example. The Catholic Church, one of the most powerful cultural forces in the world, has been protecting rapists from legal consequences for decades at least, and probably much longer than that.
Moldova xd
Its extremely easy to debunk "rape culture" in the west. Lets see. Do rapists go to jail? yes, Do rapists get murdered in jail for being rapists? yes. Do people merely accused of rape lose their jobs and have their lives ruined? yes.  There you go. If you still think rape culture exists in the west you are what they call stupid.
I like feminism. I also like tits in video games. In the age of the internet, that is a very confusing place to stand.
This is a great video that makes pretty valid points. This deserves more views because every other video is just people ranting with their opinions, no facts, and no logical thinking seeming to be done.
Many people in America use drugs. Not many people rape or support rape. False equivalency argument is false equivalency
This guy is not entirely terrible. Better than Shives, I'd give it 4/20.
I'll believe there is rape culture when there is empirical evidence that rape is approved of by some major facet of society, and that there is causal evidence linked to some sort of source, whether that be familial, societal, or via media, the exception being if someone can prove rape is innate to a Y chromosome but I am doubtful that you will find a stable correlation. The examples you cited are individual cases, and therefore in the grand scheme are abberations. Another way you could prove a rape culture, prove that males in fraternities commit sexual assault at the same rate that Catholic priests commit pedophilic acts, so prove that 6-8% commit these acts, then I will be more sympathetic to the idea that that environment encourages sexual misconduct.   There is also a reason that rapists in the process of a criminal trial would say they thought their victim's wanted it. One, they are delusional, and/or two, they are trying to hinder establishment of mens rea in their crime. If there is not a mens rea of purposeful, knowledgeable, reckless or negligent, then the act itself does not constitute a crime (unless it is strict liability like statutory rape). That simply leaves the Actus reus which is not enough to convict someone of a crime unless the crime is strict liability. In short, those accused of rape potentially lie in order to evade prosecution and incarceration. I am curious how people who agree with you consolidate this legal contradiction: At equal levels of intoxication you can engage in sexual activity or you can drive a car. In the eyes of the law, you do not of the mental faculties to knowingly engage in the first behavior, but you do have the mental faculties to engage in the second behavior. Why is your consent or decision making severely impaired in the first scenario (therefore not responsible for your actions), but not severely impaired in the second scenario(therefore responsible for your actions) when you could engage in both activities at the same BAC? I understand if a woman is passed out, black out drunk, or was drugged why that is absolutely intolerable and would be considered rape. But why do many feminists insist on two separate measures for culpability?   The reddit thread is anonymous and therefore impossible to verify its veracity, I believe the "luring rapebait" guy was reprimanded by the university, therefore indicating dissatisfaction with his attitudes towards women and rape. When getting rid of institutions that "encourage rape culture" encompasses practically all media (because at one point or another every feminist has pointed to something as solidifying rape culture, including innocuous jokes by Warren Buffett), that becomes a major first amendment issue. And if you are banning expression on college campuses that receive federal funds, that is actually a first amendment violation. Not saying you agree with people like Sarkeesian, but my point is that getting rid of institutions you find unsavory is only a good option when "you" are the one in control. And in all likelihood, you won't be the one that decides which institutions need to be banned. Using your argument against fraternities, I could easily argue for the proposed muslim ban.
This is why I hate when men shame women about wanting sex, because if the idea of a woman enjoying it bothers you than what is left but rape?
ive watched alot of your videos but i must say... your arguments are only half convincing. Half, because you putt relaxing music and talk rationally. The other half you do ZERO to prove anything you say.... like your genderqueer video lol
Pre-rape JUDO you fucking feminist.  I have  brown belt in pre-rape judo, but my teacher won't let me test for black.

2:20 Hey, don't pick on Romania's little sister, Moldova, lol. But seriously, I'm Romanian and picking on Moldova is like picking on Romania. And I got it was a joke but still.
The picture at 09:55 , the red one, is that real? A real transcription from the courtroom I mean. It seems completely inhuman to me.
"the truth is that I have no influence over cultural traditions in North Africa"  Not with that attitude.
Here's a worksheet I found to help you determine your Maryland Income Factor: http://taxes.marylandtaxes.com/Resource_Library/Tax_Publications/Tax_Tips/Personal_Tax_Tips/Maryland%20Income%20Factor%20Worksheet.pdf. Hope this helps!  (Also this was a great video and I appreciate someone tackling these issues with intelligence and nuance, especially on YouTube where those qualities are usually absent.)
I found your channel the other Friday in related videos to a Hbomberguy's video, and boy, it's a shame I didn't find you earlier. :) Your videos are nuanced and I like it how you also briefly analyse in another vid how Sarkeesian could have enhanced her presentation with some humour instead of just saying you're not a fan of her. :) I personally like her academic style, but that's just me...  Even the comment sections in your vids seem comparatively civilised and intelligent.
Yes, calling people who do terrible things Monsters provides camouflage to others who do terrible things.
the song around 7 minutes, what's the name, please
How many rapes occur per population?. Blacks commit far more murder in america than any other group. But thats just a tiny percent of the black population, so do you teach all black people not to murder?. You're just making mental gymnastics to justifying your collectives viewpoints.  You could remove the stigma and shame from young men about being virgins to make them less desperate to get laid and incourage no sex before marriage if you really want to reduce that teeny tiny chance of rape. Oh but your feminist friends enjoy going on wizardchan and making fun of those poor sods. THERE IS NO RAPE CULTURE IN THE WEST APART FROM WHAT ISLAM BRINGS.
Thank you
COHORS THEM? Sorry mate but you are still too drunk, which part of "ask them to do X" is not asking for consent ??? I am sorry I get the alcohol thing is a douche move and I do not blame the drunken girl, as I do not blame someone who leaves his door unlocked and gets robbed, the asshole is the theif or the rapist, period. If I ASK someone to suck my cock and they say yes and do it, is it rape because they are drunk? And what if I am drunk too? Are we even then? And what if I wake up tomorrow with a girl riding on top of my cock, after a night of drunken partying, am I being raped? Or I should just "Man up"? Also why did you not show the full email?  Btw wanna reduce rape? Start telling women, go out, have fun, dress as much of a slut as you want because YOU CAN, and just in case someone is feeling rapey, and since you probably have WAY LESS BODY STRENGHT than a man, DO IT WITH A .38 IN YOUR PURSE AND ICE THE MOTHERFUCKER. That to me is a solution, people owning up to their most obvious responsability, their own fucking safety.
ContraPoints's imagery is the best
jesus christ, that james bond clip was fucking terrifying
ya NAILS BITCH THEY'RE BEAUT
I feel like Sargon is your fetish
fuck you faggot for making reasonable points.... I might have to change my mind and shit... eww..
I still can't believe how good this channel is. Everything from the writing to editing to aesthetics is so on point it's overwhelming. Plus you're *actually* a rational free-thinker.
A song of "you know you wan't it" is proof of rape culture?! Piss off!
White people were the first to end (legal) slavery worldwide. Why are people still bashing them instead of praising? Just fuck off, with the white slaver bashing!
''rapists don't think they did anything wrong'' Well you don't really expect them to confess their misdeed now?I get the point youre making but i think the issues has more nuances than just that one because a criminal will almost never admit that they are guilty.
very good one
Nice slide playin'!
I love your take on things, and can I just say that I also love the clear influence of Plinkett's Star Wars prequels on your videos?  I think I can.
That final point you made really spoke to me because I see so many people in the progressive community pointing at one another, criticizing one another and pointing out flaws, and, while that is important and necessary in order to make the community as inclusive as possible, I sometimes wish that they turns even half as much energy towards countering and correcting the myths, lies, harassment, and abuse out there. I'm not saying that there isn't room for debate within the community and it's always great to POLITELY point out flaws to help make sure that everyone is respected, but I think it gets to a point sometimes where it's arguing around points which are either passed and people have apologized for or points which are simply different perspectives which can both exist reasonably within the movement while there are much better problems going on outside of the community where the community could be doing much more good than it already does.
I said it many times before... I am an anti-SJW type... but holy hell, if SJWs were as informative as this, I couldn't help buy agree.
I wish I could force everyone to watch your videos
Anglo-American culture descended from the Greco-Roman. The Roman Empire was militaristic, but was open about it. The U.S. pretends not to be militaristic and an empire.  So not only is it a Rape culture, which always goes with militarism but it is covert about it. This sublimation or forcing the reality out of our frontal lobes is a serious mental illness and pathological. It explains Trump and the chaos that is taking over.
Thanks for addressing anti-feminist arguments. I dont agree with you, but its nice to watch an actual debate. Good luck.
😮  live near the first fraternity you showed the front of, and I remember the day they did that. Ugh.😤
I like the video overall, but I disagree with your use of It's Always Sunny, or at least the unspoken notion that it contributes to rape culture. Dennis is not a sympathetic character. Unlike James Bond, he is not intended to represent the viewer. His main role on the show is to represent terrible ideas that the audience reacts critically to. In this role,  he is a very good representative of rape culture. By being so nakedly cynical about sex, he exposes ideas that are often unstated. At least, that's my interpretation of it. Perhaps others disagree.
If someone commits rape in the face of broad social consensuses opposing rape, what is their attitude towards lying likely to be like?
The consent concept adapted from research ethics to sexual relations is fundamentally incapable of recognizing social cues and unfairly biases what is oftentimes a dispute with no material evidence in favour of accusers. The ultimate uncomfortable truth is that the best method by which to further reduce sexual assault is to instead incorporate a knowledge of physical evidence preservation and responsiveness into an education that reinforces the notion that crime victimization of any stripe is not a personal moral failure, but is also a serious claim that should not be made lightly. The first line of defense against victimization is the would-be victim themselves, and a populace thoroughly capable of self-defense, in whatever form it may take, would undoubtedly prove to be a more effective strategy than policies and theories that are openly rooted in social conditioning and rewriting individuals' behavior. A polite society is an armed society, even if what you're armed with is a knowledge of how to fully utilize your legal recourse.
Fight me in a google hangout. I want to expose your bullshit you mentally ill faggot.
I love that you exist.
I was with you all the way until the end, with the massive Make Atheism Great Again thing. What the fuck are Dawkins, Maher, and Ayaan doing with the others?
Years ago my cousin came to England as an immigrant from Bangladesh. He actually asked me what would you do if you pulled a girl on a one night stand and she accused you of rape. I shockingly realised that he did not actually know the difference between consensual sex and rape.   I'm a Muslim brought up in England. I have to saying not all Muslims are not rapey but I'm telling you that there is something very weird about people from Muslim countries
I see your point, but to conclude that this means america has a 'rape culture' is to shift the meaning of that term from describing a society where rape is acceptable, to instead describing a society where people get confused by the subtleties of flirting sometimes, particularly while drunk. I feel like there should be a different term to differentiate between rapists who deliberately force someone to fuck against their will, and rapists who get drunk and misread messages. For now, let's just refer to those two as "hard-rape" and "soft-rape".  By those definitions, a lot of the middle east has a 'hard-rape culture', while we in the west have a 'soft-rape culture', or at least sympathies towards 'soft-rapists'. But to label both those things with the broad term 'rape culture' is to devalue that phrase into meaninglessness, in the same way that assault both describes a slap across the face, up to near-death brutalization. When a term covers such a huge area, it loses any real meaning, which acts to the benefit of the monsters and the detriment of the almost innocent by labeling them both the same thing.  So to conclude, america arguably has a soft-rape culture, but absolutely does not have a hard-rape culture, and the blending of those two concepts into one is extremely harmful for all involved.
jesus fucking christ, sargon is a moron
I'm marathoning your entire channel and I love you.
LOL you deserve so many likes for that intro
That last part explains why this trend of "shitlords" is so toxic. Having a couple of people critic the small inconsistencies in an overall positive ideology is desirable. Having a shit ton of them constantly shitting on that ideology and not acknowledging its merits is annoying and regressive.
It'll take so long for people to see whats going on and I can see how people are frustrated it's not happening in their time. It probably won't happen in my time. >_<  In health class I can't remember a conversation on consent and rape happening very long. All I remember from that short short chapter is "Don't rape because this and this will happen." I think the teacher gave in to the faces cringing in discomfort. But me being lethargic and clearly having a problem with my shins and flat ass feet still had to run on be held back till a miracle happened or I broke down and became a PR problem. :") I went to online school after that semester... Abstinence only education is shit and what sad is that is the most progressive class I had compared to sex ed in middle school and the school prior to that one.
Fuck me you're entertaining. I spend a good deal of time in the land of the shitlords, I'll admit, but I'd be uncultured swine if I didn't tell you you're videos are spectacular.
You're kind of like a Cameo song.   I say that as a compliment, by the way.
YOU ARE NOT A WOMAN FUCKHEAD
FUCKING GROSS
Another issue about the appeal to Third World thing is that you're preaching to the choir for the most part. Like, yeah, everyone's already aware of the shit in Africa and the Middle East.
i really enjoy your academic and informed yet humorous approach, you consistently construct your arguments well but are not afraid to mock yourself a little in the process and honestly mad respect for that. Looking from the titles and thumbnails I kinda assumed your content would be the very right wing/anti-sjw reaction video content that you infact critique and i'm more than pleasantly surprised
Your entire argument pivots on one point... just how prevalent is rape culture in the West?  Your video shows very clearly that if there is a rape culture within Western society then it is only found in very small pockets.  I dont disagree with your observations on where we can find dubious attitudes towards 'taking advantage of women', i do however question the size of the overall problem...  And here lies the SJW Feminist problem...  The massive prominence that you have put on this problem is disproportionate to its prevalence.  And everyone can see it.    Back when active Feminism was relevant there were massive sexist problems with society, and consequently everyone got onboard with the programme.  Feminism was not only accepted, it was adored.  But now... Feminists are either picking on small problems within modern society or theyre outright inventing problems where they simply dont exist.... and THAT is why there is such a pushback against current Feminism.  If Feminists had pushed the rape culture issue correctly, fairly and academically honestly then you wouldve had more success in achieving your goals... by viciously demonising everyone you have failed... monumentally.
Hmmm. I'm not quite sure I get exactly what you're saying about dumpster finger man.  You do say that perhaps we are making rape too sensational, and that this is an overreaction. Alright. Then you say the sentence was too light and the reaction to it's lightness was a good thing.  I get the impression you are saying it should go to a middle point between the too sensational reaction and the wrist slap for the reaction to the crime, but I'm left wondering what the actual reaction you think should be is.  What should the sentence have been in light of the idea that 'he's not 100% a monster, but he got off too light?'
moldova? did you end up on that the same way i did? i was looking to triggerypuff and somehow one thing linked to another and i ended up on the moldovan pop group who wrote the numa numa song...
the old movies are fucking disturbing oh god
Some interesting counter points but I just feel that Western "rape culture" tends to be exacerbated. Mainly because the average man and woman knows that rape is wrong and most do not tolerate it at all  We know it's one of the worst things you can do to another human being. I think the problem most people have with this particular issue is how a lot of these feminists come off as militant with this belief when majority people in most civilized countries know rape is wrong to begin with, no question asked.   I understand the whole rape accusation thing is a touchy subject but there's no denying that there are some women out there who will pull the rape card to get something they want and that is why trials may take a little longer because the jury wants to make sure it's the truth because plenty of lives have been ruined based on false accusations.
I'm not sure I agree with you 100% and I'm not sure consider myself a feminist or an anti-feminist, but it's such a breath of fresh air to see someone arguing the opposite of Youtube's anti-SJW circlejerk in rational way.
Rapists don't think they're rapists, racists don't think they're racists, sexists don't think they're sexists. It's scary when bad people can't see that what they're doing is bad.... it's scary.
same guy who disrespected my concent is now saying immigrants need to be turned back because they disrespect women. also, i'm having a flu and i don't have any friends.
Maryland? Does that mean there's a chance in fuck I could pass by you in real life? You're so beautiful.
*CHEAT SHEET*  • Complaining about feminists focusing on women's problems in the global north, but not the global south (e.g. Africa), as well as being a fallacy of relative privation, is ignoring the fact that your words/actions have greater impact where you live than where you don't. A global north citizen has more responsibility to address problems on their own turf because they can have more of an effect there.  • Saying "rape culture doesn't exist because rape is illegal and frowned upon" is like saying "drug culture doesn't exist because drugs are illegal and frowned upon". Or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's infamous "there are no homosexuals in Iran".   • A big problem isn't that most men are horrible, evil, nefarious demons, it's that most rapists don't see what they do as "rape". They tend to think the person they're forcing themself on wants it. In other words, they don't properly check for consent.  • The desire of feminists isn't to get rid of rape completely (as it's been going on since time immemorial), but to minimise it as much as possible through proper education on consent and bodily autonomy, and through creating a culture where women aren't seen as mere vessels for men's sexual enjoyment.
That would be cool unless asking for consent every 5 minutes of an interaction with a woman would completely dry their pussy off.
9:14 when did TJ or armored skeptic say the only thing we can do about rape is to make women dress like nuns?
That clip of Adam Lyons is legit terrifying
You're brilliant, subscribed
A song saying I know you want it is glamourising rape?  Come on, does anyone really think that rape culture is comparable to drug culture? Even the government largely don't care if you do something like weed, I know as a kid the police would turn a blind eye to drug possession all the time, that just doesn't happen with rape.  There are things large glorified by the media, such as drugs, serial killers and violence but rape isn't one of them. You also have to ask yourself, even if it was glorified does it normify it? As a liberal I have argued with conservatives about this on the medias of music, film and video games. It doesn't effect real life, so why are you now the conservatives on this? It's like you've betrayed the left.
do you care about male genital mutilation?
You're videos are fucking hilarious and super well put together.
that is a surprisingly competent theory as to how frat rape becomes so widespread
So to summarize, would you say it's more accurate to say that there are rape subcultures in America (Like frats) that are widely reviled by the general society whenever they rear their ugly head? That to me seems like a better measure of our culture, a more majoritarian view.   You also mention that most people view rapists as heinous monsters when that's just not so. I can't speak for everyone, but I think they are. A monster in a suit going to Stanford is still a monster. Monsters don't look like anything in particular. These people aren't unrecoverable, but they do suffer a pathological inability to empathize with others(at least to the extent that they can go through with rape without thinking about it) and that makes them monsters, at least in my book. They need serious help.
To be fair, Pussy Galore wanted it. So it wasn't really rape.
Well although I disagree with you in some cases (I am not a huge fan of feminism and I think egalitarianism is the better ways to go with the shit lords that populate the movement now) I think this was a very well made and a very good argument for rape culture and it does shift my view a bit. I do agree if rape is allowed in a fraternity or any other such group the best thing to do is to shut it down. I don't exactly think this means we have a rape culture but maybe I am wrong, and I think we should look into it deeper because there is a serious chance that one of us are wrong and if I am wrong and there is a huge problem. If your wrong there is still a problem.
@ContraPoints
I find that people generally assume that sex is normal human behaviour, and therefore it's generally assumed to be OK until proven otherwise, i.e, yes means yes, no means no, but anything else (including nothing) means yes. You can have my nudes if you send yours ;)
i love you. you are amazing
You are my new favorite vlogger.
The reason people say feminism is cancer is because they have been manipulating politics for years with bogus studies and outright lies to gain more political power. They have destroyed the nuclear family with the result that more children grow up without fathers and live in poverty. They glorify single moms and vilify the the father despite the fact that she holds all the cards when it comes to having children. Men get tricked into fatherhood all the time but feminists completely ignore this fact. Now most prisons are filled with men that were raised by single moms, welfare is becoming affordable, and despite men committing suicide at 5 times the rate and being 40% of domestic violence victims none of these issues are allowed to be even talked about without being called a misogynist. So yes, Feminism is cancer!
I wouldn't say that's necessarily "rape culture" but rather a society that's still not great at handling rape. Then again, I've never been to the USA, and I've grown up in a country that ranks in the top 5 with most gender equality - a list where the USA ends up all the way down at 28. So perhaps I am less exposed to this "Western rape culture" or something. Still, while I do agree that what you describe is problematic and I do think that teaching consent would significantly decrease rape since many rapists don't understand that they are rapists, I don't think it can be compared to African and Middle Eastern rape culture. Cultures where women are literally treated like property that can be sold, bought, used and damaged. Cultures where objectification of women takes on a disturbingly literal meaning. Cultures where women who get raped are blamed by the entire society because it's women's job to keep themselves "pure" and not tempt men. Cultures where barely pubescent girls are married off to grown men and raped on their wedding night (and then repeatedly throughout the marriage, of course). Cultures where a woman who has premarital sex can meet punishment in the form of hour-long gang rape. A judge that fails to properly convict a sex offender does not equal rape culture. A culture where rape is overall seen as bad and unjustifiable is not a rape culture. Rape certainly exists and is not always taken care of like it should, but it's not a black and white issue.
When you say that in most trails, they say that they thought they wanted it to, isn't the excluding the people that plead guilty and realized they did something heinous?
4:17 how do pictures and clip from the music videos represent rape culture? 10:34 Are you sure that this scene from the James Bond is meant to present a rape scene and not some kind of aggressive foreplay? It looks very much like rape but after he forces her on the ground and starts kissing her she starts caressing his head if I was raped I certainly wouldn't caress the rapist.
I like your videos, your funny and seem moderate and reasonable. But I disagree with you on The Amazing Atheist and Thunderfoot, ect. I think you have a lot more in common with them then you think.
give me your guitar
I want a ringtone of contra saying "goddamn it".
your arguments against the idea that rapists can't be taught not to rape is flawed in my opinion for one using court statements as an example when obviously in most cases people are going to say the thing that gets them the least time in prison which is some variation of "i thought she wanted it". second the reddit post while i don't like reddit as a source to begin with because 90% of stuff made on reddit is karma grabbing fake stories even in the one line you sourced he says "i think that's when my drunken mind" which in my  view shows that he obviously knew after the fact that his perception was wrong, though i can see how that can be argued that when your drunk your actions and thought process are in some sort of subconcious or primal state. that being said i just wanted to say that i love your videos even though i don't agree with some of your ideas keep doing what you do. :)
You reduce rape by not allowing third world immigration.
I think the James Bond point is funny while everything about the movie The Passengers is happening. We have come so far but so little in other ways.
Laphroaig 10, great whisky.
Is there something being said quietly and possible backwards at 12:31?
I think it's slightly inaccurate to put up a picture of Law and Order SVU when talking about how we revile rape-- this show shows that we are fascinated by rape, not reviled it.  Nearly every episode opens with showing a medium-explicit rape scene (except in the child rape episodes).  I think it's absolutely an example of what you called double think.  There's also a historical and legal context here.  Before we talk about rape culture, I think it's a good idea to have a broader context.  Rape used to be defined as gender specific, limited to certain acts, and has a "resistance requirement."  This makes it sort of unlike any other crime, because it started out as a DEFENSE to the crime of adultery.  I woman could be cleared if she could prove rape.  Even into the 90's, many states had "marital exemptions" which said rape within marriage isn't rape, because it wasn't, it couldn't be, because you can't commit adultery with your own husband.  EDIT: also, I never encountered ANY discussion about consent in my sex education.  Also I gave a presentation about genital warts that I did NOT consent to (this is a joke).  That said, I'm not generally a big fan of shutting things down.  Yes shut down frats that are raping, but not just all frats.  This is because I disagree with how you pose rape in frats.  I think frats start with misogyny and rapiness, and this seeps into their relationship with each other, not that it starts with their rapiness to each other, then results in them treating women the same way.  Finally, we do still have borderline rape scenes in media.  Game of Thrones is a big example, with their Cersei/Jamie rape scene that the writers handled so clumsily that they wrote it accidentally.  EDIT 2: finally, when feminists in the 70's said that PMS was made up, they were reacting to a society that had... really exaggerated what women's hormones do to our judgment.  There were murder cases where PMS was raised as a defense by women murderers, similar to insanity.  This undermined women's rights in all fields.  So the idea of PMS they were objecting to WAS a construct.  What we consider PMS today is much less saturated with this idiocy that 'all women are crazy once a month" which is why you can never give us the nuclear codes.
Also Shoe0nHead said you were her favorite feminist youtuber on her ask.fm
This was my first video of yours. Really good and informative, I found myself agreeing with everything you said :D
Logic on Youtube... with no yelling or hate? Oh G-d please let this be a trend.
Fear and Loathing reference? Or is that a reference from something else too?
On your photo of shitlords at 12:28:   Sorry- bit newer to youtube. Who's the chick on the far left? And I read Ayaan Hirsi Ali's biography and thought it was pretty illuminating. Why is she on the shitlord list with the likes of Sargon?
I don't think I've ever watched a James Bond film all the way through, but HOLY SHIT JAMES BOND IS A RAPIST.
Haha, that was an anal hook. Got a fetlife?
Good ol' Sargon of [Citation needed, MY FEELINGS A BLOO BLOO BLOO]
Me: *sees bottle of Laphroaig in opener* Me: *immediately thumbs up without waiting for rest of content*
I really love the point you made about Brock Turner. It struck me because there's always someone who can relate to criminals, but there are so many "criminals" rotting away in prison and so many communities being destroyed for it, because they are being judged by a society that cannot relate to them and their particular struggles.
Thank you for being honest about Brock Turner.
Truely outstanding choice of scotch, I consent that laphroaig may enter my body at any time it so desires.
What are you doing on this site? You're arguments are way to nuanced for YouTube!
omg the ass hook.  I died
You provided ample evidence for the existence of first world western rape culture. I'm not saying you didn't, but what is with the tangential mushy headed nonsense about how rapists don't know that they are committing rape. Hey here is an serious question for you, are you capable of experiencing such a loss of self control that you could rape somebody at not know it? if your answer is no then what characteristic differentiates you from a rapist if it's not some psychological fault or personality disorder. Hint, That is exactly what characterizes rapists, personality disorders, are yes, They lie persistently about their level of self awareness concerning their actions, because they don't what to see themselves as rapist even if they know that they are. Is it not glaringly obvious what kinds of practical and psychological benefits that kind dishonest/double think (what ever you want to call it), has for pieces of shit who rape people. I can fucking spot dudes like that from a mile away. You has colossal blind spot on this issue.
I think you need to do a much better of substantiating the statement you made at 6.02. Rapist see their rapes as rape they just don't admit to it. Have you even known a real sociopath? They lie and when called out keep lying, they are unembarrassable. You got this wrong dude. I really like this channel, you make a lot of great points, but this is idiotic a feels faintly misandrist. You are the one who doesn't understand the psychology of rapists.
Can you give me an address to send you some martini glasses? I don't want to give you money as I think you'd waste it on food.
I don't agree with everything in this video but you bring up some good points. I think the frat culture bit was very insightful but you make it seem like sex in the media, is rape in the media. Sure our media is sexualized but sex and rape are two very different things. Sex is awesome and sells well, I don't think that's going anywhere, or needs to.
3:23 The issue with this comparison is; it's already fairly illogical that drugs are illegal in the first place. A person should have the right to ingest whatever substance they choose to- because it's their body. This isn't a good comparison to rape/sexual assault; which are violations of other people's autonomy.  The issue with the "teach men not to rape" idea is it puts the onus *exclusively* on men to respect physical boundaries and laws- thus all but excusing female perpetrators (hell, some people still don't believe men can be sexually assaulted by women) from responsibility (which also ignores their victims), and essentially brands one half of our species as yet-unreformed-rapists from birth. I'd be perfectly fine with expanded sex-ed curriculum being handed to both sexes, but that's not normally how this issue is discussed. Men, whether rapists or not, shoulder exclusive responsibility for rape, and rape exclusively affects women.  There's a reason people generally only get upset with male teacher/female student relationships, and largely don't care when the sexes are reversed. There's a reason the language with regard to these issues tends to be unnecessarily sex specific.   Examples in basic terms; instead of the (in my opinion) preferable "people shouldn't be assaulted", it's usually more like "*women* shouldn't be assaulted". Instead of "no person should feel scared walking down the street at night", it's "*women* shouldn't feel scared walking down the street at night".  9:01 Amazing Atheist, Sargon, Armored Skeptic, and Thunderf00t all argued that women should "stay home, dress like nuns, and never drink"? If not, the way this is edited is somewhat misleading.  Other than those points, I largely agree. We shouldn't sweep this under the rug with "it's human nature", or "it isn't as bad in America as it is in third world countries".
Wait, you live in Maryland?
We are certainly not off the hook for rape culture. It's a big part of why I write articles like this one: http://www.fabulouslyfeminist.com/handling-rejection-like-human/
Is funny how everything is explained in James Bond movie clips which you show.  Women wanted him and want have sex with him other ways she can easily start ignoring him and he will understand. I guess he will not RAPING her.    Or you think this particulary women will have sex with someone  who was not like you saying ( alfa) ?  Is not James Bond here who is stupid is you who think you will have more possibilities to have sex with this woman with your feminizem beta stance.  But maybe you have,  I just do not belive you.
Feminism is a rape culture. OK now slow down and actually read this. Feminism participates in a system that minimizes and excuses instances of men being raped. All of those rape statistics that you see that show how women are raped so much more often than men are define rape in such a way that a woman forcing a man to have sex with her is not considered rape. This is no mistake. It's based on the work of Mary P Koss, a feminist heroin and pioneering sexual violence researcher. She didn't originate the idea. The US government defined rape in a similar way at the time. But she took the idea and ran with it, and when she's been called out on it and asked to perform future research with a more inclusive concept of who rape victims are, she's doubled down by saying that when men are raped, they don't feel it the way women do.  Evidence is available upon request.
What Sargon video did you get the clip from at 8:28? I would add it to my scrapbook of Sargon's worst sound bytes
Laphroaig, is it? Good man.
Hi All, Is it true that raping a virgin girl is considered as a traditional cure for AIDS among indigenous population of South Africa? Or this is just another a racist lie? Anyone? Thank you.
Didn't expect such a bizarre misrepresentation of Moldova from you. I get your joke, but there are so many things to laugh about in our country that actually exist, other than some militants from over 20 years ago who are not a thing anymore :D
Good video, except for one thing: PMS actually is a myth, as least as far as the idea of a period bringing on crazy mood swings.  It's not a myth pushed by "patriarchal culture" though, because there are plenty of patriarchal cultures where the whole idea is nonexistent.  It's an exclusively western idea and the vast majority of studies find no correlation between mood swings and the menstrual cycle.
seriously, i have commented this on every video of yours but i love you and you deserve more recognition and appreciation
I don't know why you've included Ayaan Hirsi Ali in your image of atheists who are anti-feminists or against what you're saying. She is a feminist. I very much doubt she would disagree with what you're saying. A lot of "skeptic" youtubers mischaracterise and co-opt what she says as evidence that Islam is the big evil but Ayaan Hirsi Ali campaigns for reformation of Islam and for the end of female genital mutilation, the end of forced marriages and the end of the criminalization and murder of ex-Muslim apostates in Muslim countries. She is an activist that focuses on issues that effect her + her community, that effect Somalia + the Somali people.
D E N N I S
I am so glad my friend showed me your vids. You are awesome! Also, yeah I know what you mean about the people claiming they were on your side all along, like Hillary saying she was ALWAYS supportive of same-sex relationships and then after I saw a video of her bashing Homosexuals not that many years before.  Your ending reminded me of what someone said on Facebook to me about how even though whenever I join various LGBT groups and fight for Transgenders and for it looking like a lost cause that I should keep on doing it because the world doesn't change over-night. You have to keep working at it.
Keep up the good work, these are excellent <3
I love you ! ( but not in a creepy, stalky way)
You just mind raped me, happy.  So by your very own logic, within western culture there is a "sub culture" that is a "rape culture", sure I can come at that.  America, in its entirety, a rape culture is ridiculous. So your answer is in fact at 8:04 we don't live in a rape culture, did I get that right?  So we are talking about sub cultures..  Seems to me you only consider male on female rape as the only true rape (unless I switched off at some point and missed it, nope watched it twice, no mention).   Have you actually seen some female fraternity hazing video's where leaders of the fraternity get the pledges naked and make them preform explicit acts on other fraternity leaders while assaulting them with all manner of objects, no? And all in the name to be part of that culture.  You blamed media and society, how about being responsible for what you do or what you don't do?  Also, when we think rape, we often think (as you stated) violent acts that leave people battered and bruised naked in a corner bleeding and sobbing... what we don't see is a boy being a total f-wit thinking taking advantage and fingering an unconscious girl in an ally.   And on the point of the rapist (like Brock) being asked, of cause he would say he didn't think it was rape, only the hard core brutal serial rapists admit to their crime and give (for them) logical reasons why they did it.  I found almost all of the arguments you made to deliberately misleading and inflammatory with little to actual evidence other than your opinion and outrage at how other view the situation with a comparison of "it's illegal and perpetrators are punished" then compared it with "well people do drugs and that's illegal" and if they get caught they will also be punished, invalid at best, deliberate intellectual dishonesty at worst.  Rape should never happen, yet in reality there are a lot of things that shouldn't happen and saying that victim blaming is not a reasonable response, then same can be said for fat shaming, funny thing is there has been a correlation to fat shaming (of some) that get positive results, not rape I know, but if one takes every precaution surely this will reduce the likelihood as a result..  I don't agree that women have no agency or can do nothing to reduce the likelihood of being assaulted and the entire responsibility is on the man or rapist, assuming of cause that it's not lesbian rape (not mentioned in your video even though prevalent as with DV) or prison rape (also not mentioned and where the term rape culture was first used) statutory rape, (also missed and would assume make up a number of all rapes you highlighted) and not once did you touch on male rape.  On the Bond scene, it was consider customary to decline an invitation to coitus as to say yes on first acquaintance would be considered unseemly and un-lady like.  What you actually saw was (one of) the vey first example of strong independent women who not only could say no, but back it up with equal and if not superior physical ability. So now considering this as a possibility did she say no to his advances once it was clear (in this peace of theatre and not reality) he wished to proceed?  OK, it is clear you and I don't agree on most, I do agree we don't live in a rape culture, and there is still more we can do and thinking you are morally superior is not part of that dialogue..
I don't think you can act like this - minor segments of society where rape is treated inappropriately - is the same as rape culture.  There are segments of the population which are culturally Hindu, but we don't think we live in a Hindu culture.  Rape culture implies that the major cultural forces in the US (e.g. the media) are somehow excusing rape.  This is clearly not the case.
Why do you think that they really thought that she wanted it? And even if, why did they think that? Why do you think the problem is so simple?  That Thunderfoot clip was about the idea that we shouldn't teach women to be catious but rather teach men not to rape, which is preposterous. And if the man and the woman are both drunk and have sex then who is the rapist?
I was raised by single mum been a nice polite to every woman. I was good looking listened women all what they say and I never had sex. Then a one day a girl which i like she say to me that some boy sending her message all time and he constantly stalking her and how she hate that ect..  I was thinking ok this boy is so dumb and i am great white knigth.  Well this boy is now her husband and I am a wiser man :).   Feminisem is cancer and a unhealthy for a young boy.  Women convert boys in to  women and then they search men in them. A cancer.   And western world go down especialy here in europe 1,5 child on family compare to muslim 8 child on family. Lets say all thanx to feminizem.
I've been sessioning your videos for the past 45 minutes, and so far, across the board, i fucking love you. You are great.
Dude, back off the speed a little, the words per minute were insane. Having never lived in America, It's hard for me to comment, though on the surface it would seem that the whole fraternity hazing thing is just, well gay, (insert South Park definition of gay here) and rapey, but I don't know of it's existence anywhere else. The problem as I see it, is not that there should be education, but what that education should look like. Because if it looks like anything Laci Green does, I'd rather be raped, again.
Notice: no mention of ACTUAL rape cultures, like Islam. Why do feminists love sucking up to third-world primitives while bashing the West?
I think this is you're best video since you returned. Keep it up, homie!
Pretty sure a song saying "I know you want it" is not saying "If you refuse my sexual advance I will force myself onto you". If that is the evidence people use to say we live in a rape culture then that is pretty flimsy.   Rapists actually do know what they are doing is rape, that is why they take precautions not to get caught, because they know they are doing something wrong. You just asserted the idea that rapists don't think what they are doing is rape without any actual evidence. Brock Turner is a single case where he clearly didn't know what he was doing, to the point that he raped a women in in front of people. That is not the case in most rape cases, most rape cases are done by repeat offenders in the same fashion that is often away from witnesses and with a girl who was vulnerable. For instance, a girl who showed up to a party with no friends is more likely to be raped than a girl who showed up with a bunch of friends. That means rapists are so meticulous that they will purposefully target girls who have a less chance of having friends who will protect their friend. Why would a rapist even care about that if they didn't think what they were doing was wrong? They should assume that those friends would also know what they are doing isn't wrong and would be OK with it. But I'm sure your subreddit is much more compelling evidence than actual crime stats.   With Frats, you are again using anecdotal information and assumptions without using any actually statistics to back what you are saying. Frat members do actually consent to being hazed, if somebody refuses to be hazed then they aren't forced through it, they are just simply not let into the frat. This idea that frat houses are this hotbed of rape is absurd and a stereotype that has gotten lots of innocent people in frats in trouble for crimes they didn't commit.   Sargon never claimed rape couldn't be reduced, he said the idea that rape will be wiped out totally is not a realistic one, which is true, as is the case with most crimes.  Nobody said telling women how to be safe is the only option, that is again an assumption and strawman. I'm sure they will all advocate for better enforcement and more efficient systems for collecting evidence. I learned about consent when I was around 13, you were probably taught it to but didn't pay attention.   While you are far more well spoken than most feminists, you still use the same shoddy research and assumptions that most feminists use. Reddit forums and your own personal assumptions are not credible evidence.
+ContraPoints      Sweet Mother,  Dark Mother, Cold Mother,  Kind Mother, Cruel Mother!!!!!!    So Beautiful, and with your Anita shrine  omfg.   I'm gonna Tweet this to Anita Sarkeesian.   Right now
as a determinist nothing is anyone's fault, love you great video.
There's also a caveat to this in cases where female teachers commit statutory rape on underage male students; here the student will be praised for his 'conquest' as it were, and that's pretty fucked up. Also a good point about people just not understanding what rape/abuse really entail, alongside the mention of how fucked some fraternities can be. Though some of the studies into the rates of rape can be dubious at times (e.g: the source of the 1 in 5), the wisdom would be that more blame and focus should lie with the perpetrator (and not with what the victim did 'wrong', assuming these circumstances are more commonplace than the incidents). Articles on men being assaulted on the streets for instance aren't inhabited by as many victim-blaming comments for instance.  I mean, why DO people think rates of rape are higher in other cultures? It is... cultural, right?
This video is great and you've explained the meaning of this term better than anyone else. I still think that calling western culture a rape culture is an exaggeration as much as It would be calling it a drug culture.
Was... was that a shot glass you were playing with?  Cool.
I think the primary cause for derailment is semantic. "Rape" to most non-feminists is reserved for the truly sick and twisted individual who finds pleasure and sexual release in the violation of another person's intimacy.  I think where feminism fucked up here is instead of developing a new term to describe the new concept for criminal behavior, they broadened the definition of a pre-existing term that had some SERIOUS baggage attached to it. So any time one opens with the premise, they have to start from a position of "you just called me a monster", which is likely to delay progress in the debate if not close it off entirely.  I feel like we'd all benefit by differentiating this crime of negligence from the crime of psychopathy. A "manslaughter is to murder as Brock Turner is to rape" sort of thing. (I'm giving Brock the maximum benefit of the doubt for the example, that his story is true and he actually WAS so drunk he didn't notice she had passed out... which to say the least isn't a particularly convincing story.) "Sexual assault" is usually the go-to for that sort of thing, but I don't think you can by definition unwittingly assault someone (at least outside of feminist academia's definitions of assault)... so it still lacks the kind of nuance that I think is needed for this conversation.
I got here from the1janitor and now I'm subscribed. Very funny and thoughtful video. =)
Dionysis and Apollo. Style and substance. More matter and less art. Did you know canola oil is made from rapeseed? The Gulf Of M is now an ecological dead zone. Watch fracking nightmare video "Gasland 2"
I normally don't listen to these things because they don't use any factual information and pretty much say men are all pigs CASE CLOSED but I actually enjoyed this one. Thanks dude.
Wow. Fantastic video, very eye opening. Well made!
This is such a great video. Excellent job!
Here is an example of "rape culture", presented by Kristi Winters, Doctor of Sociology in her debate with the "evil right wing demon" Sargon:  She describes the obvious oral rape of a woman who is passed out drunk. "You've been raped. You've just been the victim of a crime, right? Well, not in Oklahoma."  She then describes a case in Oklahoma where the finding of the court was that the act occurred as the victim claimed, but the perpetrator was not convicted. The prosecution appealed, and the appellate court upheld the verdict. Sure sounds like orally raping a passed out woman isn't a crime in Oklahoma.  Rape culture, obviously.  Except it IS a crime in Oklahoma. The prosecutor chose to pursue the case under Oklahoma's forcible sodomy statute, which is extremely narrow and requires physical force (holding someone down, threatening them, using a weapon, etc), none of which were elements of the act in question.   The act in question is covered under Oklahoma's sexual battery statute which has a much more broad definition, and which is punishable by up to ten years in prison.   The elements of the crime did not fit the statute under which the DA chose to prosecute it. The appellate court was operating under the proper and necessary constraints of the judicial arm of the government.   It was not *allowed* to make a different ruling, as it is bound by the law as written--it is neither the job, *nor the right*, of judges to make law. Their job is to interpret the laws that are written by elected representatives who govern through the will and consent of the people.   It is not a prosecutor's job to make law, either. It is a prosecutor's job to compare the elements of the crime against the definitions within the existing statutes, and choose which statute has been violated.  If someone broke into my house while I was on vacation abroad, and stole my belongings, that would be burglary. If some rogue prosecutor decided that burglary should be rightly be considered as serious as robbery and charged the perpetrator with robbery, I expect that perpetrator would be acquitted of that charge. I expect that no matter how passionate the prosecutor argued his case before an appellate court, the appellate court would uphold the acquittal.   Why? Because definitionally, the act he committed *was an act of burglary, not robbery.*   Just because a court found that he had not, in fact, committed robbery, does not mean that the legal structure doesn't consider what he did a crime. It just means that the prosecutor is a moron, or a cunt with an agenda.   Now, this example was brought up by a woman whose nickname is Kristi "CITATION NEEDED!!!!!" Winters, because she will insist that the most banal and uncontroversial claim be cited. She cited media stories about the case (and that misrepresented it), but not the decision itself.  Here is the first line of the media story she linked: "An Oklahoma court has stunned local prosecutors with a declaration that state law *doesn’t criminalize* oral sex with a victim who is completely unconscious." [emphasis mine]  https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/27/oral-sex-rape-ruling-tulsa-oklahoma-alcohol-consent  A complete and outrageous lie, repeated without question by Dr. Kristi "CITATION NEEDED!!!!" Winters because it fit her narrative.   And she did it without even investigating the case, let alone the statutes (just like the Guardian did). She read the hyperbolic media reports, and looked no further.   I mean, it's Oklahoma, right? Home of Bubbuh and Cletus Cornpone, registered inbred Republican voters. *Of course* it would be perfectly cool with the law to orally rape an unconscious woman in a jerkwater state like that, wouldn't it? If the entire western world is a rape culture, then Oklahoma must be ground zero.  She dropped this "rape culture bomb" with complete and utter confidence during her opening statements in the debate. She was absolutely certain that her assertions were true. Even though they were not, and the most cursory investigation on her part would have revealed that.  And somehow, we are to trust people like her when they tell us we live in a rape culture?
please let this channel get big. Like seriously you talk with so much sense, you remind me of T1J, both of you are actually independent thinkers.
I just came by to tell you your intros are hilarious and I especially liked this one :P Anita! Get outta my childhood!
I don't think that even in muslim countries or in the Congo there is a rape culture. Since, I don't think islam is glorifying rape, and the congo lacks culture in the first place. The only instance where I think actual rape culture might exists, is for the istitution that term was coined for, the US prison system. Anyway, I agree with you that the sex education in the US is severly lacking, but I don't think the approach feminists have is leading to any solution in that regard.
Your videos have a lovely blend of intelligence and sincerity. I look forward to seeing more from you in the future.
I wish all the SJW shit were as enjoyable as yours is.
My biggest issue I've rarely seen anyone or any feminist go after Saudi Arabia in the same manner that was done in South Africa. There's no bad press. No push by anyone it seems. Whats most damning however is the endless defense by feminist towards Muslims without condemnation for the prime doctrine which functions oppressing women.
"It's not rape if romantic, orchestral music swells in the background" lol
I like your point about teaching consent as part of sex ed.
Check your Single Malt Privilege, shitlord!
The problem is the only solutions I've ever heard from feminists about rape culture are either vague or really stupid.  Like not telling rape jokes out of some unproven assumption that jokes that rely on rape being shocking and taboo increase the likelihood of rape.  Or "teach men not to rape ", and only men because female rapists aren't worth trying to stop, and even even when they do they never really specify beyond.  And the worst idea of all was to get rid of innocent until proven guilty when it comes to people accused or rape, which is what a lot of colleges are doing now.
If you don't want to define what feminism is and isn't how can you defend it later saying it's not all bad ideas? Seems inconsistent.  Also saying that Sargon and Thunderfoot would've been against MLK had they been born in the 60s is just a low blow personal attack, and I don't see how that's not bullying (or close to it). Also that's kind of irrelevant. Even if they hated MLK right now that wouldn't change the validity of what they said about rape culture or feminism.
this video is such a roller coaster. Every sentence in which you make sense, you follow up with a sentence with complete bullshit. You have been drinking some weird stuff lately.
Is it weird that I like both this channel and Thundetf00t's channel?
Oh my God... this whiskey!!!! I simply love the hell of it! Prohibtive cost to get where I live...
Rationality on YouTube has turned into something what can be considered a important virtue to have. to a sticker you apply to yourself and from others when you meet the accepted criteria.  Hatred towards SJW's  Feminists.  Blacklivesmatter.  And soft targets such as online religious fundamentalism.  Rationality is now a buzz word you assign to oneself one you have been made worthy, through a short career in hating all those that are considered enemy's in the eyes who hold the most influence on what is considered wright and wrong on the internet.
amazing
See...Maybe your points are or aren't correct - but at least you present them in a non-offensive way - unlike most of the SJW on youtube.
Please not Juggalo culture.
This was defo your best vid. I'd consider myself anti-feminist-leaning, but your vids are a breath of fresh air.
Why was I not subscribed to you before?
What set of items would not count as culture?
I find your hypothesis(about rape culture) to be intuitively sound. However I feel that if we were all to sit around a table and attempted to analyse key words in your hypothesis it would crumble. I don't know that you are wrong but it sure does feel like some sort of appeal to intuition or overlooking problematic definitions is needed to obtain your conclusion.   However I will like the video since it is more layman-friendly than your run-of-the-mill rape culture video. Also, would you ever consider doing a livestream with a Sargon or a Thundefoot?
Your rampant AIDS is keeping your strawmen weak AF.
11:25 Sure, in that way. But it doesn't stop the most popular show on TV right now writing a rape scene they didn't even know about because it "became consensual"... I wish were done with this BS.
Subbed!
Awesome video! Glad that your rebirth on YouTube mean more to me than when that one guy, what's his name... Allah Christ got crucified on a Swastika, keep up the good work! :)
Welcome back!! :D
I don't necessarily agree with what most feminists think is consent. They seem to ignore all of the nuance in the situation. No, I am not saying the instances like the James Bond thing is okay, only that it is not as simple as "no" and "yes". If a girl is visibly discomforted but still says "yes", then you should still stop. If a girl say "no", but is giggling and rubbing herself all over you, I wouldn't hold you accountable if you continued to see where things go. What matters is body language.  We should teach guys, when they are younger, that they should be less aggressive, but we should also teach women to be more assertive in situations like these. If they don't want it, they should put their foot down, so it is more black and white if the man continues.
I'm not from America, i'm from the civilized world, but what i learned in sex ed was a bit of anatomy, contraception, and how awkward your first time is. We can probably do better.
Most of your "evidence" is one time scenarios. Where you go wrong is there are no statistical facts supporting "rape culture." *JUST ONE TIME EVENTS* (Hopefully that was all-capsy and boldy enough for you to read)  Here is a one time event where a female cheerleader rapes a 15 yr-old boy: http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2015/08/21/molly-shattuck-ravens-cheerleader-sentenced-rape-boy/32108039/  See, if you think that, that is enough evidence to support female on male rape culture (Vise-Versa), then you are completely retarded. <-- Also, this is called an Ad Hominem, please stop using shit like this as evidence for the "anti-sjw's just hate on people instead of giving insight" claim or whatever you want to call that bullshit.  And yes, I know the female to male rape ratio is not in favor of women. That does not mean your "rape culture" is prevalent.
I hope you continue to make content, this is golden! Your videos are articulate, well thought-out, hilariously irreverent, and just on point.
Another solid output, my man. Here's to hoping today's feminism is remembered for the good it has done decades from now, and not for the period blood art.
YOUR VIDEO MAKES ME ANGRY.  I mean... what was up with that background music?
I guess it's just a detail, and I may be a little bitch for "complaining" about this, but putting Richard Dawkings in an image with  the armoured skeptic and the amazing atheist like if they are buddies just mmm no. And I don't think Darkmatter2525 belongs to that "category" of youtubers either. I don't know I guess I'm a little fanboy bitch but I don't think darkmatter agrees very much with the armoured skeptic and the AA, I put him waaaaaaaay above those guys.  Good and fun video, you are funny and you try to be objective I find this last thing very lacking in today's youtube channels of this kind, liked.   SUGGESTION: Some sort of video about the upcoming U.S elections?  Sorry 4 bad english.
the quality of your productions lately have been on some Wes Anderson levels of win.  nailed it. again.
I agree with most of what you said, but you have to admit you oversimplified sargan.
Damn now I've got the hots for Nic(k)
can you release your cover to "one toke over the line"? it's the best one i ever heard.
What you've succinctly described going on here is the *_essence of American hypocrisy_*, as demonstrated by the ever-growing cult of YouTube brolosophers like Sargon and his depressing goon-squad. Not many Americans have escaped the inculcation/propaganda mechanism set up in 1917 (Creel Committee), whose primary directive of conditioning the American masses has enjoyed *enormous* success. In particular, we have a massively subordinate intellectual class who's task it has been to install the malware of "American exceptionalism" on the public mind, again, with stunning success. Professor Noam Chomsky explains the role of intellectuals here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huMUGm5z6RE
♫In my time of dyin'...♫
I love how you point towards the media and pharmaceutical companies to demonstrate that there is a conflict about drug culture, but with rape-culture the best you could come up with was.... blurred lines.    Fuck off with "blurred lines" already, it really doesn't mean what you people would love it to mean.
Alright,  You say there are drug sub-cultures in america... and you're right. But you'd be completely fucking bonkers to say that America, or the west IS a drug culture. Same with rape culture. There might be some fraternities who have different attitudes to consent than the rest of us, but in no way do they dominate american culture, do they?
Fabulous. The Night Mother, The Teeth Mother and The Dancing Mother approve, my child. ;)
(ALL CAPS IN PARENTHESES)  Nice!  That should bring in the YT money.  Gotta keep the whisky and bourbon fund fat. Sadly, I think more people were upset with the judges ruling, rather than the rape itself.
Laphroig:  finally, some good whisky!  Islays are the best.
YES! Sane non-partisan opinions from a drunken drag queen John Lennon with a redundant comedy editing style! I've been waiting for this kind of content for years! The Anita Sarkeesian as the night mother bit is pretty funny too.
1:25 uhh huhhuh hehe hahahuhuhu you said... you said... the... hook. uuuuh uhuhuh
Another great video! Please keep uploading 😊👍🏻
I don't see how anything you mentioned is a force that leads to rape. Can you show an instance that that college email lead to rape? Or watching a Bond movie normalized the idea of rape in any specific cases? Or is this admittedly just a hypothesis you know you can't prove but decide to accept it as truth anyway?
Rape and drugs make a terrible comparison.
Rape and drugs make a terrible comparison.
Brock Turner knew what he was doing was wrong. When caught, he fled. Just because he makes a statement to the court that he didnt realize what he was doing was wrong,  doesnt make it true. Those are the statements of someone who doesnt want to go to prision for YEARS. Again, you could have taught Brock not to rape till you were blue in the face, and he still would have raped that girl.
Thank you for bringing some alternate opinions into the "youtube ranting crowd", seems like it has become a safe space and echo chamber of its own, and anyone who disagrees will be labelled feminazis, and ignored.
I understand now. I think "teach men not to rape" is an unnecessarily alienating statement, but it does probably mean what you say, and that seems reasonable and actionable. Thanks.
Judging from these videos, you might be the one person who has seen the Mr Plinkett reviews more times then I have... oh, and good video.
What is the difference between justice and social justice?
Great video.  Maryland taxes weren't so difficult for me, tbh.
another great video! Loving your work buddy
"bad theory of the psychology of it" THIS. We lack such a vital understanding of psychology...
You’re missing the point. Of course, even the worst of us don’t think themselves to be a bad person, but you can know that society says, this is wrong, and still have the ability to rationalize that it isn’t wrong for them somehow.   I think you give feminism too much credit, I think a strong case can, and is being made that they’ve actually slowed progress on this issue of late. May I suggest shit lord Steven Pinker’s book, The Better Angels of Our Nature, Why Violence Has Declined.
James Bond raping? Come on, this is taking a bit too far: I love James Bond, I grew up with James Bond.
First thing's first : There are plenty of ways you can contribute to the betterment of women's position in other countries - especially through special interest groups, which is getting easier and easier every year through the internet.  Now, there is nothing wrong with wanting to focus on issues closer to home - but here's the thing :  most people are not making the "Why don't you, as a feminist, focus more on the issues of women who have it the worst?" in a vacuum. Often this argument as made as counter to when feminists try to guilt-trip non-feminists for not spending time on/rejecting feminist activism (or *gaaasp* on the advocacy for the rights of groups that happen to be men, or predominately male), or when feminists go over-board on their characterization of "western society" whilst calling criticisms of non-western countries treatment of women etc. for racism and bigotry.  You don't want to spend time trying to effect change in Saudi-Arabia? Your choice, "good for you". I personally have too much shit on my plate to fight for anyone other than myself and my family/friends, period. If someone wants to drop shit on my porch for that, then they better be applying their principles consistently and not make distinctions based on things like "whether the people are close to me or not" while being a douche to me when I'm doing the exact same thing, simply because I'm pointing my good-will in a different direction than they are.   Secondly : The U.S has A drug culture (or arguably many "drug cultures) - there is however a not just a small distinction between the U.S having "a drug culture" and the U.S "being a drug culture".  Saying the "U.S is a rape culture", given what the definition entails, seems to say that it is reasonable to characterize the majority of the U.S as a rape culture, the same way it would be reasonable to characterize it as "an English speaking country", or "a predominately white country".  You concede this towards the end - my only question is this though : if you recognize this distinction how is it that you're still making the argument as if this is not something the "shit-lords" of the internet already get? Or rather, how is it that you're making this argument when the "there is no rape-culture"-crowd is essentially a response to feminists who quite clearly make the argument for rape-culture as if it's a reasonable description of most western societies as wholes?  Thirdly :   The argument that convicted rapists didn't know that they were raping because they said so in interviews is inane, since no-one without a wish to completely sabotage their own case in court would say "Yeah, I knew she didn't want it, and did it anyways".  Granted that there are probably guys out there with a confused view of sexuality and consent, I think there is little to suggest that the majority of people who decided to pursue sexual activity with another person without having received clear consent are not simply people who don't give two shits about consent to begin with. There is however, a mile's difference between thinking of rapists as people with damaged moral compasses, or reduced capacity for empathy due to chemical imbalances in the brain, developmental issues, or trauma induced psychological change, and thinking of them as "evil monsters".  Furthermore, your personal history with sex-ed is rather unimpressive. Having grown up in Norway, a country with sex-ed that eclipses that of the most (if not all) of the U.S's, I still did not encounter consent-ed, and never yet had any need for it in order to understand intuitively that you don't force yourself upon people who don't want to have sex with you, or on people who cannot express clearly, under ordinary circumstances, that they want to have sex with you. Despite this, most third-wave feminists in Norway spout the exact same talking points as U.S feminists do - indeed they talk as if the two countries are essentially indistinguishable from one another despite major cultural, historical, and contemporary social differences between them.  Is feminism cancer? Certainly not - plenty of feminist activists who do marvelous work for women in harsh conditions. Feminist academics and philosophy though? That shit, for the most part, needs to go.
There are no rape cultures at all, nowhere on planet Earth.
Now that I've managed to remember who you are, did you have a three way with that Canadian cocaine fiend?
Pussy wanted it from the beginning. She just considers the rough housing as foreplay.
Its good to see you putting your classical education to good use.
If you want to have any influence in this Western, first world country, you'll have to do better than criticizing Thunderf00t and TJ because they're only echoing a fraction of the things that have filtered down to them from women like Christina Hoff Sommers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKgrYVtYSCk  And Karen Straughan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8XegAwuc-8  And Alison Tieman: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXK0bfrvjPM
What do you think shoving your private fetishes to the forefront of your videos adds to them?
A voice of reason, a gibson les paul and leather lingerie...good to see you back!
I don't agree with you, but you are more mature than most people I hear talking about rape culture. Thus, I've decided to put my differences aside and give you a thumbs up in hope that it will produce more of you. How very kind; I know. Keep up the good work.
Damn! I didn't realized James Bond is a rapist when I saw Goldfinger in middle school. The orchestra ticked me. That's fucked up. Great video!
With the James Bond segment you cut out the foreplay ju-jitsu.
Very good. Both the video, and your choice of whisky.
"They say"  Massive straw man. Most advice I've heard coming from the antifeminists you mention, is to be careful, be ready to defend yourself, carry a weapon l, learn a martial art. Some do say that if it's dangerous to go walking around at night, maybe you should avoid it. I'd like to know at what point did common sense become a tool of the patriarchy? TBH if it is, then maybe that's a good justification for society to be patriarchal.   Second wave feminists used to call many of these things "female empowerment".  I am 6 foot 2, weighing at 20 stone, work as a bouncer and have been to prison for violent offences. I don't walk around at night, unless I have no option.
Check Karen Straughan on the issue. I believe her video is "don´t be that lying feminist". Also check Alison Tieman on this. Her video is "Mens' Rights vs Feminist Rape Culture explained using Puzzle Pieces" It is really like you have been absent thru all the debate. You miss the ideological rebutal of your proposal. You use examples of youtubers that are not experts on the issue, but do not listen to the experts. You take the "lowest" denominator when talking about your ideological oponent´s.  Dare to respond to people like Karen.  You look at James Bond. I prefeer "Twilight" as an example of what you call rape culture. I know you know there is a diference between saying "I know you want to", and raping someone. There is such a thing as the desire to be convinced, pursued and desired. Coitus requires a complex ritual involving a lot of comunication; should we label every instance of misscomunication as "rape culture"? It´s a bit hiperbolic don´t you thing?.   Sure; you´ll find examples of rapist claiming they didn´t know what they where doing; it´s a common defense that works well since feminist introduced the idea. It´s easy for the defense to claim the rapist was himself a victim of "rape culture". But psychological studies find that even if they don´t call it rape; most rapist have an undertanding that what they are doing is not acceptable in society and that they are doing it without consent.   It´s like you are advocating for what happend in UVA with the rolling stones.
Now i want good whiskey at because of you subtle placement of Laphroaig(-;
And here we go.  Thank you debunking the notion of western colonialism & white hegemony being the most powerful political force in the world.  When Britain was an Empire & had actual colonies. We exerted the same level of control over our colonies tags we did over our own nation.   Comparing drugs to rape is flaws on many levels.  1) One is a victimless crime, the other isn't.  2) Laws on drugs are not different to temperance & prohibition of the 30s. A silly idea.  3) Rape, all forms. Are viewed on a similar level to the worst of all crimes. The fact that you cite one case, where a just she was lenient doesn't prove a trend. Why don't you count the amount of times people have lost their jobs, families & even their lies on the mere accusation.   4) Even criminals detest rapists. Having gone to jail in my youth, I know how badly rapists get treated. I've had a "quiet little chat" (obvious euphemism is obvious) with a rapist myself.
Right on point, as always. Great to have you here in this desert landscape that so desperately requires nuance.
Nyk, just a little thing here.  Stop shotgunning your arguments with generalized criticisms aimed at a cork-board of photos.  If you would show a photo to imply guilt, go a step further and hold those individuals accountable for their own personal, explicit transgressions.  It's not exactly a fair tactic to simply imply guilt by association and stroll along with that cloud hanging over the accused while failing to actually illustrate or justify any given personality's inclusion.  I'm not saying any given one isn't guilty of your implications or accusations, just that you don't always illustrate it so.  That's an integrity problem for me.
Would you consider a debate or a stream with one of the anti-SJWs? Would be really interesting.
3:40   That is a bad comparison. A rapist will be shamed for live for raping someone, while doing or selling some drugs are pretty much acceptable.   4:30   Is there a pedo culture? The whole society and the state hates pedos, but Salon said that pedos are not monsters. See, this is the problem with the term 'rape culture'. It is *not* part of our culture nor is it part of 'western society'. If rape culture exist, pedo culture must also exist.  4:45   I don't think you should confuse pedophilia with teen porn. There is quite a difference between a 6 year old and a 16 year old.   9:05  Education is generally good. I just don't want feminists in charge, which will call consensual sex rape.   10:25   So, no rape culture?  12:50  k  12:55  Which is why feminism is losing popularity?  13:25   http://i.imgur.com/bAAnv74.png
Awesome stuff, brace yourself for the backlash though.  I do think you are too antagonistic towards the "anti-SJW" crowd and generalise them a bit too much, which will probably result in a lot of folks dismissing you. I get the impression that you want to propose a middle-ground between the rampant third wave feminist sentiments and the reactionary backlash against them, which is fantastic because I do think both groups are harmful. But I'm not sure how good making them feel bad would do. That might just be your style though, but I feel it clashes with the very insightful content.
I love this. This is amazing!  I am so glad you started making videos again!
Great video.
