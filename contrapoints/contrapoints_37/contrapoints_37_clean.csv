"Very very interesting video! Although I would say that I lean to the right but there's no denying the progressives' creativity!    Just on a few points about criticism of capitalism though, I hear this being mentioned time and time again, I believe it to be factually wrong, please correct me if you guys have any thoughts.    1. Workers being stripped with any autonomy and the value of their work is basically just being handed to the 'lizards' that does nothing. I believe this is the image you are trying to paint, and I believe this to be inaccurate.    Any student of commerce would know profit comes with risks. The 'lizards' of the companies generally face a lot more risks and stress, most of them work longer hours, have less of a personal life because of their responsibility towards, if all else disregarded, their own interests and stake within the company. In most circumstances, employees are free of responsibility, stress and risks. Any employee who are severely mistreated, underpaid by their employer, could see his/her talent realised by a competing firm. This is generally the case. While there are certainly exceptions to the rule, it seems to me a mistake to paint all workers contributions flowing up to the 'lizards' and only able to maintain the bare minimum.    2. Market creating desires. Sure advertising does create some desires but nothing could be further from the entire truth in my view. In marketing there is a terminology called latent need. Which describes a need that the consumers might not have been aware but is catered for by a innovative product. A random example could be a smartphone. Before the smart phone, people might have been satisfied with going to the web via computer and call via a tedious phone book and a traditional phone. But the introduction of a smartphone made it easier and satisfied the latent needs of consumers. Once they realise how convenient the smartphone is they decide to consume the product. Whilst it is true this product is simply created, you could say, but does it not also satisfy the basic desire for things to be as convenient as possible? Surely it's just human nature to want to quality content such as contrapoint on a convenient smartphone without the need to carry a massive computer everywhere they go?    Anyway these are my thoughts. Just to clarify, there are many problems in our society and many of them stems from capitalism. However, some criticism of the systems that stemmed from Marxism are simply not correct in my opinion or at the very least very outdated.    Lastly, thank you for addressing the Communist Russia and China problem. As a Chinese, I assure you the those Communist regimes are not something you would like to experience.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"How is it someone so, both intelligent and educated, can be so embarrassingly dead wrong about 911? Because to blame it on anything, ANYTHING but religion is on par with something Ben fucking Shapiro would say. When ivy league educated engineers, engineers who had no experience with western oppression or colonization, fly planes into buildings, I tends to assume (foolish, I know) that that ivy league education made them articulate enough to accurately describe why they did it. It's not nuanced or even complex. The only connection they had with western civilization was, months before the attacks, they took a trip to Dubai (and their titty bars) felt an enormous amount of guilt due to their bronze age religion and felt there was only one path to redemption.   How many more engineers need to fly planes into buildings before we start taking their word for it?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I'm just trying to explain that there is a justified reason for their angst, which happens to be shared by everyone since Capitalism oppresses all people!  I used to think that technology would give humanity and society more leisure time and increased wages; but, it's not.  It's being used to unemployed we worker bees; and, if we cannot find a job, then the internal message is spread that we somehow must be lazy, despite there not being enough jobs since every recession permanently sheds jobs from the market as they are taken over by the still-employed to squeeze every scent paid to by that employee for their wage slavery.  Meanwhile, because the Oligarchs cannot see the long-term results of their actions, they financially squeeze the majority of us, while prices continue to rise, making it harder for use to buy much of anything.  Well, one would think it would sock these Oligarchs in the wallet, right?  No!  They have given up on making their money in the US and have set their sights on the asian countries and in Europe where people still have disposable income to spend!  And, our bought off politicians like, Nancy 'We're Capitalists' Pelosi does NOTHING to address these heinous problems.  They won't even let us have nice things like a Single Payer Healthcare System or Tuition-Free College for all that the Oligarchs have taken from us and by exploiting us!

Capitalism is not about having people work for other people, to leech of their means of production, like it seems to me that you are portraying capitalism. Capitalism is a system that favours the free market and trade. The whole idea of capitalism is that by leaving trade and the industry to private people with an interest to earn money people will get an insentive to produce better quality products and services to a better price because of their competition.   This of course applies to the labour market as well. You are only going to work for as much as your employer is willing to pay you and vice versa.

"You want, and use, all the benefits of capitalism and western civilization, and then crap on it from your penthouse view while failing to recognize or care about your own hypocrisy.   You are the very epitome of artificial virtue.  People like you, ironically enough, demonstrate exactly why socialism can't survive by your own very existence.  You would have literally NONE of what you have now, if you weren't living in a capitalist system, and despite your ostensible intellect and talent, you're apparently either oblivious to that fact, or are so fundamentally dishonest, you don't care about that fact, because you've successfully monetized other people's pain.  You CAPITALIZED on the ignorance of the evils of socialism.  It's a special kind of disgusting.   The equipment you use, the makeup you use, the real estate you use, the very foundation of EVERYTHING you do is only there because of a system which recognizes and leverages fundamentals of human nature to make the world go around. AKA- Capitalism.  With all its flaws, it's the only system which recognizes the value of the individual, and allows for lateral movement, and yet you seek to destroy it in favor of a system which invariably destroys everyone but the tiniest of fractions at the top.  Sound familiar?   Socialism fails on day one. If you're capable of being honest, I can prove it to you. But we all know you'd never agree to even hear about it, because your ability to make a living in this capitalist system is contingent on you being a socialist. Irony. What a bitch.   If you were truly exceptionally smart, vs your bargain-bin, discounted, generic intelligence, you not only would understand this, but it would be so obvious, you'd laugh at yourself for being so stupid.   You are using the capitalist system to your own benefit, and in so doing, you're selling a harmful ideology to weak-minded and uneducated people.

(Barter, time banking and other means of settlement). If you want to call out the demon you must do so by name, and it don't start with the letter C.  Our issues all relate to a ponzi  money system that requires growth to sustain. You want a revolution? The target is the Central Bank. Yes, the F'g Global bank. It is dangerous though. Look what happened to Libiya. Syria is holding out but I'm not taking bets. We won't be free unless we adopt  a monetary system wherein currency has no intrinsic value: Making money with money (interest) must be outlawed.

"14:56 I like to think that the answer perhaps is in Chile. In 1970, socialist president Allende made it to the presidential office with 37% of the votes because the other two parties couldn't sabotage him in time. The result? Economic blockades and active sabotage that starved the population plus a right wing coup that forever changed politics. Allende made many mistakes of course, but he got right what China and Russia got wrong: He didn't rule through terror and censorship. This, in turn, meant that Pinochet was on a very short leash. Instead of killing millions, he killed between 3.000 and 9.000. Not nearly enough to kill the ideas.   40 years have passed, the dust has settled, and the younger generations got to study both sides of the story, and while they do not get along they tolerate each other enough to sit on the same table and drink, which is how revolutions always start.    People under 30 are well aware that their ancestors were played as pawns during the cold war. They are also aware that it happened all over latinamerica. Problem is that they are disilusioned and won't vote... But at least there's no lizzards here. Our upper class owes allegiance to money and power alone. The revolution is not only possible here. It would be supported by the rich, as long as they get to keep their share of the cake (which is small if you compare it to the layered cake of the lizzards)   Since it's pretty much impossible to flush the lizzards out of power in the US without severe bloodshed (lots of radicals, every group hates the rest, easy access to guns, government well-experienced in warfare, etc) maybe latinamerica is where it will all start. It wouldn't be the first the time the US frees itself following the example of others, right?   So yeah, it's a good start that you have your videos subtitled, but if you want to kickstart the revolution, you may want to recruit a latino to help you code your message to a smaller but much more open audience.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

All of the terrible statistics mentioned are actually not that bad: compared globally and historically, American citizens are ALL wealthy and have better access to basic necessities.   This video has NOT defined any problems with capitalism! In fact, it terribly assigns the tragic conditions of small percentages of the population (the poor) to the wealthy, and indiscriminately so. The problem with doing this is a completely false narrative that if only the super wealthy 'shared' their money, then the poor would all be just fine. Unfortunately, this is factually incorrect. Even if the top 10% of wealthy Americans were taxes 100% (ALL of their money) there still wouldn't be enough money to feed and care for the poor (housing, food, and health care), furthermore, research and basic logic has shown that you would actually INCREASE the 'poor' class (because, hey, the rich people are giving out free stuff!).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"In the right people are getting sick and tired with corporate midia and the financial system. Guys also are getting tired of being treated as garbage by the justice system that by the way, is totaly dominated by feminist lobby. Funny thing, left always pushed for a revolution against capitalism, but seens like that is the right (not the politicians, the people, especialy mens) who will start and lead this revolution. I telling you what a see, this will happen at some point, because neither Trump, neither Bolsonaro (because i am from Brazil...) will deliver what they promised for mens (that was the vast majority of voters). Mens are angry, and i belive, and most leftists activists (at least those more vocal online) don't realize this is going to happen. Just look at whole Steven Crawder x Carlos Maza thing? Youtube Demonatize Crawder, and the big media claim Maza is some sort of hero. But the fact is that all Maza did was set rage against LGBTs, most folks on the right don't have contact with reasonable people from the left on internet, only with those SJW idiots that seens like can't diferenciate reality from their favorite cartoon (like Maza, altough i think is acting more than beliving). And that is just the tip of the iceberg, the online comunity only. I didn't even start talk about parental alienation, uninployment, the fact that mens are 90% of homeless, 95% of victins of urban violence... Things are getting pretty ugly for mens in general, even rich ones are starting to feel the effects. The plan actually already have being put in place, mens are boycoting society at large numbers. Maybe that dosn't sound 'radical' enough to you but let's just say that we as mens are sick and tired to work our ass, even give our lives to a system that dosn't give a flying fuck about us! So our plan is really doing nothing AT ALL! Absolute NOTHING, we will STOP and let the system rot. Let womans work in mines, mantein the sewers, do the hard work, let them be 'empowered' girls that they want'. I gave you just one fucking week, but if that isn't enough, we go for a month, if that isn't enough we go for a year, and if that won't work, well, we start to rebuild civilization because at this point certanly there will be not much standing of the so call capitalism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"With the opening, I noticed that it seems to be the market's reaction to the  vast number of cultures  that have to be catered to (in order to maximize profit). That being the case: the most bland and inoffensive approach is the only way to ensure that no single culture is offended (and therefore, lose out on their revenue). Continuing that thought,  countries used to primarily be designed for a culture; to codify their collective set of values and protect them .  Some values are very specific to that country, while others have similar values that can translate over (IE: Western Europe) while others cannot (IE: the Middle-East) .When those values are debased through multiple cultural competition  they become lost. Because the values are now not shared, the perception of relatability  is no longer there. Now, the  less enviable traits  (greed, lust etc) are more likely to be expressed and manifest  increasingly over time. Free Trade (Capitalism) is only reflecting that loss, not the cause of it. When you addressed the rich,  I agree that it's not a very nice thing to spend one's money on ,essentially, useless items/services, but they are well within their right to do so. I believe that everyone  has 'negative  rights' (the right to not be robbed, murdered, raped or defrauded), but when it comes to 'positive rights' (universal healthcare, public education) there always is some form of extortion going on (I've heard it said as 'there's always a gun in the room'). You can definitely encourage people to act in a humanitarian way towards others who are not as well off (ostracization can be a powerful tool) , but when it escalates to the point of violence (whether outright or implied, such as with taxation), you're violating someone's right to their property.   Nevertheless, your presentation was entertaining.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"... but socialism isn't the answer since it always fails into even worse Hellholes unless supplemented by other systems.  Pure socialism probably needs a telepathic populous to even work; but they probably lack individuality at that point and if so would probably fail as a 'society' and border too much upon a Hivemind; it may be peaceful & provide the needs for all on a basic level, but: 'you'/'the self' will not exist; alternatively it devolves into a fascist utilitarian police state as the only realistic manner to actualize its paradigm into a stable reality; which have always been seen as Hellholes, historically.  A social capitalism with a strong founding idealistic constitution is probably the way to go, so sort of like a merger of USA & Canadian systems, but reimagined relative to the modern issue alongside with the old issues; or like USA + unification of the States, & perhaps Canada(?), with adding some new constitutional points that promote utilitarian social welfare, but explicitly minimized in a way that is financially viable in a sustainable way; but would probably require a revolution from the ground up because neither Nations have the foundational framework to make that a realistic reality, but I also do not trust anyone to really design a system that is 'safe for us' without being ruthlessly not giving a f* about anything other than pure long-term functionality; but I am not aware of any personality with power working on that talking point in the modern day.  It cannot be breached within a climate of being concerned with being morally correct; because the actual solution would probably be perceived as f*n pure-evil by all those invested into the old & modern ways.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Based on what you've described in the video, The problem doesn't seem to be capitalism itself but how we view the aspect of trade. People today expect to earn money from one person at the top of the chain instead of making small trades with other people to become the person at the top of the chain. Thusly these top dogs have security in their income and are able to spend money on advertisements to get their trade out to anyone that would buy it. If there were competitors that got more money without advertisements we would then see less advertisements. Think about it, when was the last time you responded to an ad and bought the thing(?), Most people will say practically never so why are there still ads on every platform? Either someone is directly giving them money or they see a competition.   It would make more sense that they have a competition to keep their advertisements going with the causation fallacy, e.g. 'We make ads and see customers, therefore the ads bring in customers.' Taking the ads out of the equation now, Why then do most people not make enough money to support themselves? 10:10 - 10:25 & 10:48 This is the perfect breakdown but not because of capitalism. Why are there so many people suffering homelessness and debt in the Federation (Talking about a continental nation shouldn't be on the same terms as talking about say Germany, more comparable to the entire EU by size and pop)? People are allowed to use their money as well or as poorly as they want but What causes homelessness and debt, a need for money. Why is there a need for money, i.e. Why are people going into Medical debt and student loan debt, and why at such a high rate? Lets pass the torch because we have to derive the answer, Why is Tuition and Medication so Costly in the US? _What are the requirements to sell education and Medication?_  Education; In order to sell/trade education you need a bachelor's in education with a major in a field you wish to educate but that is fine, in order to run an institution is just like any other business. Pay X money to your state and you will be permitted to stay running, and as individual teachers you also pay X money for your income working. Using Supply and Demand we know that the harder something is to produce then the higher it's price will be, e.g. Higher Tuition cost would be caused by higher tax rate. Larger campus = higher property tax. Medication; In order to sell/trade Medication whether it be a surgeon or a pharmacist requires a large amount of education with high grades to be accepted into a pay grade. You need a license to practice medicine in the US and that makes sense. However we have Welfare and state required insurance in some of the states, That is where medication is at the highest price and people are becoming indebted but there is more money to work with? We didn't change the Supply, The number of facilities that can practice medicine are the same but we yanked up Demand by giving people more money that the price of using equipment has skyrocketed and thusly leave people in debt for using the equipment.  Price is dictated by Supply and Demand, More comparative Demand makes things expensive so the goal of national economics (no matter the politics) is to lower Demand by comparison of Supply. If we make more Medical professionals/devises the price of medicine goes down, If we lower the establishing price for schools then we will have lower tuition. This is a reactionary scale so prices won't change within the hour, but by the next quarter the prices will go down significantly.   Write to your Governor or Congressman to lower taxes on schools and increase funding into medicine and we will have lower prices. If after effect the prices stay the same after a quarter you will know that is because someone/people got a *huge* raise and you shouldn't give them your business, they will either change or die out.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Natalie, You lost me when you criticized Red Lobster and Chipotle. These chains are popular (and hence ubiquitous) because a lot of people judge them to provide a good value relative to the available alternatives. Many people feel they offer a good combination of tasty food, reasonable price, convenient location, pleasant ambiance,  good service, etc. Even if the fare on offer in the chain restaurants is not to your taste (for culinary, aesthetic or ideological reasons), there are lots of alternatives in a capitalist society. Heck, your can even produce and prepare your own meals or cooperating with like-minded people in a commune.    Meanwhile, people residing in the socialist societies your seem to favor, often have difficulty obtaining food that people in capitalist societies would view as substandard. And, notably, they are not free to criticize their governments/leaders for failing to provide adequate food, housing, security, etc.. There are lots of natural experiments in recent history and the present-day where people in neighboring socialist and capitalist countries (e.g., North Korea and South Korea, East Germany and West Germany, Venezuela and Chile) demonstrate the failure of socialist economies to provide for citizens' basic needs. You're right that there is still poverty in capitalist counties, but the lot of the poor in, say, America, is much better in absolute terms than the middle class in socialist countries or middle class Americans of a couple of generations ago.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i really don't see much benefit in critiquing capitalism if you don't present an alternative. It's really easy to tear holes in complex ideas and criticize them, but we need some kind of structure or lack of structure and some form of capitolism seems to be the least bad one, although america specificically MIGHT benefit from adopting some more social democratic policies in terms of work, healthcare and such. It's easy to be a revolutionary because the system is rotten and has glaring problems, but let's just see how well those revolutionaries do when they are in power trying to deal with all the challenges of economy and government. It's easy when you can cite a vague utopian ideal of your beliefs, but try putting them into action and you'll see the messy and complicated reality that makes it so easy to critique captiolism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Yeah. That's not true at all. THIS IS PURE MISINFORMATION. All you did was hold a bunch a variables constant and describe how those things are evil. You are aware that 'those reptiles' are people like Peter Thiel, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, James Harris Simons and all the rest right? Where were they 30 years ago? Nowhere to be found right? That is because they were SO PRODUCITVE, EFFICEINT and INNOVATIVE that they generated new value for people, in the interest of capital, that wasn't there before. Duh. This is economics 101. You are reimbursed for the level of human capital and skill you endow to the market. Prices and value conferred are simply a reflection of how many CONSENSUAL TRANSACTIONS YOU ENGAGED IN. You can make mud pies all day at your house, and work really hard, but if nobody is willing to exchange labor tokens for them (aka money), then your effort was all for not. Nobody designs this at all. Prices are simply a reflection of scarcity. The scarcity is generated by the hyper-complex, grand INTERDEPENDENCY known as the free market.  You also are aware that the 'CEO Lizard is reimbursed' in a completely different fashion than the 'poor worker' right? That CEO is taking 100x more risk than the labor. His compensation is pegged to the performance of the company via shares and bonds, NOT HOURLY INCOME. Company dies, he gets booted, and the LABOR ARE TO BE REIMBUSRED. CEO's come, and go, come and go. They are not static positions that are unaffected BY COMPETITON! Also, that angst you speak of is typically sourced from students who took no PRACTICAL OR PRAGMATIC considerations into account when applying their free time to fields of study. Accounting and engineering, computer science and medicine solve more PRACTICAL problems, therefore, over time, they TYPICALLY get reimbursed more than theatre arts homie. Duh. You keep making it seem as if reality IMPARTS NO COSTS ON HUMANS. You are aware that if nobody engages in accountancy, companies and organizations, hell, even households will be needlessly wasteful in how their production is allotted and consumed right? You are aware that if nobody engages in appropriate civil engineering techniques, bridges will fall right? It doesn't matter if we feel like engineering is boring, hard, or too technical. What matters is that REALITY will impart a cost on you for dispensing with rigor and dispensing with practicality. Yeah, and advertising? Umm, that is an attempt to convince you to consume. IT IS A CONSENSUAL TRANSACTION!!! You are not obligated to consume, but rather you can apply your earned capital elsewhere. Who told you to consume? Nobody. You simply say, NAH, I'M good, and then move on. They have the right to advertise, and you have the right to reject or consume. YEAH, FREEDOM IS PRETTY COOL.  And I love how you bitch about Uber, a company that never existed until like 5 minutes ago. They are a developing firm trying to make everyone more efficient. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO WORK FOR THEM. If you don't like the deal they put forward, then walk away and apply yourself elsewhere. Easy as that. Freedom to engage in contracts is nice. And bloated loans? Yeah, that's a consequence of BLOATED, CENTRALIZED, BUREACRATIC government, not the free market. There is no truly free market in medicine or education thanks to people like you dumby. And those homeless people? Uh dude, you need a more precise picture of it bro. How can you dictate what their every individual choice was? Some of those individuals chose it, rejected every helping hand, committed crimes, financially mismanaged their wealth, couldn't conform to a routinized life that a domesticated home necessitates, etc,etc,etc. (My wife is a social worker, so I can attest to the EXTREME COMPELXTIY that generates homelessness) And yeah, the lack of support is a consequence of DILLIBERATE MISREPRESENTATION BY AGITATING, POLARIZING HACKS LIKE YOU.

"Capitalism almost killed me. The overuse of antibiotics on factory farms breeds superbugs that medications can't cure. 70% of the antibiotics sold in the US go to factory farms where animals are held in disgusting conditions. This becomes a cesspool for illnesses to become superbugs which gets into our water system, becomes airborne or travels from one person to another. 26,000 Americans die each year from antibiotic resistant illnesses. It will become the leading cause of death in 2050, what this means is that if you get something as simple as and ear or throat infection you could potentially die. Please buy meat without antibiotics in them. Remember that politicians both Democrat and Republican are there to protect capital & not people. They protect companies like Sanofi etc. & they will continue to protect these monopoly's until we all die out in 2050. We're also going to lose 2/3rds of our food supply because bees are dying off while RoundUp is being sprayed onto our crops by Bayer which recently merged with Monsanto.

"I think some times companies advertise to like, spread information that their product exists. It's true that a lot of the products that are shown in this video are luxuries and superfluous goods, like diamonds, sports cars, fancy booze and so on, and that most advertising for those things is going to be by definition manufacturing desire because no one really inherently desires those things. But people do inherently desire status, and that's not a product of capitalism, it's something our monkey brains like. I am supportive of changing norms around status and what it means to be successful and so on, especially as it discourages these mostly useless and often highly unethical products, but that doesn't seem like it needs to come from dismantling capitalism. Like lots of leftists have already come around to seeking uniqueness in status goods as opposed to costliness, and that happened under a capitalist regime. Isn't it reasonable to expect that it will continue to happen? There also do exists companies whose advertising practically serves more to inform consumers that a particular product or service exists rather than to manufacture desire for that product / push the high status of it. I realize that the angle ol' CP is pushing here is that the sheer extent of rhetorical techniques in most advertising ensures that no one is really rationally considering whether to buy a given product, but I just don't think it's universally true. I think the problem identified here is better explained by increased prosperity giving access to increasingly costly status goods without a good spiritual foundation to understand and enjoy them. I think saying that advertising, and by extension capitalism, is what caused this is reversing the cause and effect.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You are conflating a lot of things with capitalism that are anti-capitalist. It isn't capitalism to protect elites with regulation that harms the average person. It isn't capitalism to issue 'loans' with money that doesn't exist and put the country into wage slavery. Socialist policies are to blame for so much of the things you are complaining about, like student loans,  high cost of living, and super inflated medical costs. I get there is a problem. I agree that poverty is out of control. I have a very, very different idea of how to fix it. The state is absolutely not needed to support true, free market capitalism. The state is required to support the imbalances created by the elite abusing the naivety of the public. Yes, if things continue as they are, the impoverished will rise up, they should! But I hope for the sake of society that when they do, they go after the people using government to prop them up, not people that actually earned their living. Being rich can and does happen from doing good things, because providing society with a useful product makes money, imagine that! What something's value is is ultimately subjective. Maybe spending $50 to get my nails done seems stupid to me, but that $50 is worth it to you because of the value you place on your appearance. Maybe the $50 I spend on a video game to drown my sorrows is a waste of money to you. In a free society, both of us can make those choices. In a socialist or worse, communist society, we don't get that much choice because someone decides for us what everything is worth, what products should be produced at all, who can have how much of them, and historically, it's done a shit job deciding how to even produce such basics as food, and people starve to death, in lot larger numbers than we are seeing today.   A concept that really seems to be misunderstood is what happens when rich people spend money on something you deem wasteful. So some guy spends a few million on a 'painting' of red with a little blue line on the side. Then the artist goes and spends that money on necessities and luxuries they want, and the money keeps moving forever, though the pocket of someone working minimum wage stocking groceries. Rich people and corporations are not the problem, the state protecting particular markets artificially inflating them is the problem. Bankers making money by loaning money that doesn't exist to people that can't even afford to pay mortgage and then taking their home away is the problem. The government spending money it doesn't have, making every child in this country born into debt for policies they didn't even get to vote on is the problem. The federal reserve taking income tax from the public that doesn't even cover the interest on the insane sums of money being wasted on wars, the drug war, the failing public education system, unrealistic green policies, those are the problem. By design, no matter what we do, we can NEVER pay back the federal reserve, because for every dollar printed, we owe that plus interest. It's a lose-lose scenario. Crypto is our hail mary, because it is currency outside of this corrupt monetary system.  Anyways, a lot of what you said is true, and I hope that the left and right can come together and fight the real monster here.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Capitalism isn't a political or economic system, it's a theory concerning free market transactions from an observational perspective. Everything is a subset of capitalism when you employ a capitalist perspective. Government is the tyrannical corporation that monopolized power, communism is just a different set of values of the underlying populace in favour of labour, etc.  The issue now becomes that to throw out consumer capitalism, you must look at the values of the mass people. The truth is neither the head of state, the richest CEOs, or any of us hold the power in capitalism because the market really does hold the power. Why can't Jeff Bezos hit 1 trillion USD? He doesn't actually hold *the* power, but yes he definitely holds a lot more than any of us do. Once you address how you'll make people see that these things aren't worth what they are currently willing to pay, then you haven't showed me that a revolution will be productive among the people, because capitalists follow markets and not the other way around.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Between hypergamous hookup culture and sexual predation unto men that ensues   Between the vanishing job market(s) borne both of modern automation in industry and the old doubling of the workforce (massively ramping supply but not demand to the point where the individual worker has no value to the corporate) as per the effects of the labor movement   Between the monopolization of culture by the hypersexualized, criminal, and sadistic- subsequently poisoning children by acting as the sole models of emulation   Between the romanticism of suicide that feeds into whites having a 400% suicide rate when compared to the next leading demographic or perhaps the coincidental opioid epidemic   Etc.....  You'll find the rage and outcry of the Western man. The thing is, this rage is met with the very ones who romanticize the degenerate criminal cesspool and capitalize off from the forces that drive so many men and women into a culturally consumerist poverty (that manages to keep them fat  and high enough to not revolt) telling the young white men that they are the depraved, the sick, the wrong, before they even have finished mainstream education.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Complains about shitty job. Doesn't realize that in a true communist society there still has to be shitty jobs. Only difference is instead of trading money for things you barter your skill. Farmers make wheat. They make bread from wheat. Doctor helps with sickness in exchange for bread. Live on basic essentials of human existence. And there is no chance to improve in communism. Those born not as intelligent as others naturally will still have to take up the role of the laborer. Those who are smart still get to be the doctors. But that's not to say I don't think communism is a good idea. If all of humanity lost it's greed. But that doesn't happen. Those shoes you want are the exact reason why. People want stuff. They want more than others. It's just how it works until people evolve past their tribalistic nature of wanting to be ahead of everyone and not working for the greater good of society. We are not ready for it. Because people are not ready to live with the bare essentials of survival.

Under communism and socialism, plants, enterprises, shops and call centers will still be needed, in which people will still work who do not understand why they are doing so. And the state will profit at their expense. Nothing will change, only people will not even have the opportunity to start their own business. Moreover, the power will still be distributed unevenly: sooner or later an asshole will come to the top of the government, who will distribute privileges to the 'loyal.'

"I agree with the idea that spending millions of dollars on a painting is inefficient compared to what it could be used for. But I don't think anyone has a working utopian vision for the distribution of resources. In practice, it seems like the countries that have concerned themselves with this actually do less for their poor on absolute terms. The poor in capitalist countries may be massively dis-enfranchised relative to the rich and yet, the rise of capitalistic systems have resulted in the largest reduction in world poverty in the history of the world. If the current rate continues,  poverty (the kind that basically means you are starving to death in slow motion) will be eliminated in my life time. The worst problem of capitalism is that it does more to alleviate poverty and enhance equity and equality than any other system - but it doesn't *feel* like it. That is what ends up mattering in the end to most people. That the way I see it anyway.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Alot of the points brought up in this video as a critique seem to be more of a critique of government controlled programs rather than actual buisnesses. Capatalism is not forcing anybody to take up a job you dont like. It is the lack of competition brought in by a lack of a true free market that is making people buy overpriced shitty products or work for low wages. When capatalism is fully embraced, we actually have better services and cheaper products. Just look at privatised healthcare for instance. Privatised healthcare, although not very cheap, still has brought us innovations we would have never had if it werent for the competetive nature of the free market.  The free market I refer to is a market that provides the goods and services that the people want. The more people take part in this free market and the more trade that occurs, the more people will be more well off. This is the essence of capatalism and this is why I am proponent of it currently.  Now, I do not think that capatalism is perfect. On the contrary, I think capatalism will be a detriment to many people as we move into the future. Due to automation and technological advances, we are going to see more and more of workforce without jobs as their skill will no longer be applicable. Now, granted, this is still another 10 years away, but thats still pretty close in the grand scheme of things.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As someone that follows you to get the argument from the 'left side of the spectrum' I'm not really picking up your argument. Yes advertising is manufacturing desires but is it not the choice of the worker to actually spend their money? It's not like the working class is being forced to spend their money on worthless shit. The one topic I'd like critics of capitalism to address is spending habits. We have a 'keeping up with the joneses' mentality in this country which causes people to live outside of their means. More often than not people who are living paycheck to paycheck have a spending problem, not a wage problem. I'll concede that this materialism is reinforced by capitalist marketing but marketing will exist regardless of economic structure. Unless you remove nonbasic goods from the marketplace completely, you won't get rid of marketing. Capitalism goes after our drive to want things and show off status. People in the Scandinavian or Nordic countries are much less materialistic; you don't see the same spending mentality in those countries.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Also, heres what i always say. If your next door neighbor was a starving 3 year old and you knew it and didn't help and they died from starvation. Imo you're complacency directly attributed to said childs death. Now if you spend $3,000.00 on a pair of shoes whilst kid was starving next door thats even worse than just being complacent, right? Thats super fucked up right??  So whats the difference if its a kid next door, a kid down the street, a kid across town, across the state, the nation, the world???  Its extreme frivolous, exorbitant spending that pisses me off. If you can afford to pay half a million for a last minute private jet ride but don't do anything for children starving, you're a POS. I'm not for socialism but capitalism has an abundance of shitty results as well... theres gotta be a better way to ensure kids dont go without with a free market.... Kids are innocent, they cant go to work, idc if their parents work or not. Im just worried about the kids and they cant provide for themselves. If some of these assholes felt real, unyielding hunger they'd have a change of heart.

"'Shitty jobs'   You clearly know nothing about economics, yet think it ok to AGAIN misrepresent and distort for your ideological agenda.   a) The company you speak of is providing a service to other people; the company is satisfying a 'preference' or a 'need' of the people (customers).    You may consider your job 'pointless' or 'stupid', but you are being paid by a company that is satisfying the preferences or needs of other people.   b) The CEO of a company makes critical decisions about the future of the company, they make a shit decision...then the company may go out of business...AND YOU LOSE YOUR JOB.   The amount you are paid is commensurate with the skills the company believe you are utilising to benefit the company. Why not skill up and apply for a new position that will challenge you and pay you more money.   'Alienation' is bullshit...sometimes we all have to do shitty (functional) things to get by. You think I enjoy cleaning the toilet? NO. People will have to do jobs they find dull because it serves an important function.   You think people love working at an retirement home in which the patients have Alzheimers? No...would you suggest we don't have such jobs because they are alienating? NO.

"The issue here is that while one may agree on the points against all-out Capitalism, the unfortunate truth is that electing people that want to fix these issues also comes with the unfortunate side effect of things like how we should just assume someone that claims to have been raped is telling the truth and immediately punish the other person without evidence, limiting what people can and cannot say because they disagree with you, and yes; I'm going to say it, telling people what they can and cannot have: e.g. firearms(though personally, I think these should be kept in a vehicle or a private home.)   The other issue is that under any other system than Capitalism, you don't OWN the things you obtain. Communism argues for anything that is owned to be owned by all members of society. If I own a house, I don't want a single other person to have even a chance of taking that house from me or forcing me to share it with them.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I have only recently become anti-capitalist and I can definitely say that even though my future is comparatively bright (I will probably make 80k per year starting salary when I graduate in a few months) I'm fixing for a revolution. I wouldn't actually cut off a multi-billionaires head, but I would certainly be part of the mob that breaks into his house and takes him to the gillotine.   I'm ready for a revolution, I can see that if we don't have a revolution, our species will die of climate change, and the poor will suffer while the rich lounge away the death of our species in decadent indifference. This prediction is not an exaggeration, it's already underway. In 20 years, it will be far too late. Revolution needs to happen now or as soon as possible.  It's too late to avoid deaths-Puerto Rico has already seen a massive death toll, as well as Huston, and right now there's flooding in Wisconsin that will very likely result in deaths if it hasn't already.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The irony is that the USA and western European systems aren't truly capitalist, they just feign it.  In a truly capitalist system, the 2008 crash would've sunk most of the banks who had recklessly been giving out mortgages to anyone who asked - that is the price you should pay for reckless, high risk behaviour under a capitalist model.  However, with the exception of Iceland, the collective governments of the west bailed them out. THIS IS NOT CAPITALISM.     I strongly suspect that film 'the Big Short' was right - the banks knew they would do this, so it wasn't so much that they were ignorant of the coming financial apocalypse but that they simply didn't care because they knew the taxpayer would ultimately bail them out.  Wall St banker types label themselves 'capitalists', but they aren't - if you have the attitude of 'I'm a shark, so I'm going to swim with other sharks and eat smaller fish' that is all well and good.  But, under a TRULY capitalist system, if you screw up in that environment you should get eaten yourself, not be able to beg a bailout and then wander round the corner to another financial institution which, despite your demonstrable incompetence, will hire you because you play golf with its CEO.  And so, with no incentive to change their reckless behaviour in the future, the cycle continues...   A TRULY capitalist system would scare the daylights out of these people because it would force them to face the consequences of their actions and moderate their behaviour accordingly.  That is not to say I would advocate such a system (it would likely give rise other major social issues), but imo it would be better than what we have now - a system which describes itself as capitalist, but is ready to ditch capitalist ideals the moment they threaten the interests of the 1%.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

This is a more defined version of the thought I was trying to convey I'm not saying you shouldnt read philosophers. This comment is specifically in regards to intellectual gatekeeping in that of you happen to have not read ONE SPECIFIC BOOK you therefore have no worthwhile thoughts on the matter. I didnt say you shouldnt educate yourself, I didnt say reading the works of previous philosophers is bad. I just said that you're allowed to have opinions on, say, the 'divine right of kings', without having to read everything ever written by Thomas Hobbes.

"But satisfaction of basic human needs only leads to new needs anyway. Capitalism in that sense is only an outgrowth of human nature. If human nature, under conditions of basic need satisifcation, is simply to want, to desire, it's unclear why Capitalism, specifically under  afree society, isn't better  than the alternative. If my basic human needs are met, and now I want internet, and shitty jobs are required to satisfy that want, and people are free to choose to do or not to do those jobs, I'm not sure what criticism remains that isn't circular? A non-alienating example of such a job would be one where you have some kind of stake in the company, right? In theory, people are free to collectively incorporate and provide those same services. So shouldn't the question really be about why people don't do that? Is it an issue with the system or with people under such a system or even with people as such? Yes, I'm leaving out a lot of details about the real world, but I would argue Marx does the same, leaving out a lot of details about human psychology/ability.   With respect to advertising, I think it can be argued that advertising is one of the necessary costs of privledge, of having more than you 'need.' Sure, it's evil, manipulative, annoying, and so on, but so are all costs. Couldn't one say the same about agricultural pets? If you're able to massively farm, i.e. provide an eco system for pests, one of the costs is in dealing with those pests. In that sense, pests are the price of privledge where the privledge is the ability to produce more food than *one* needs. I don't know how good or bad an anaology that is, but it's at least a spring board.   That said, I agree a better system would be something socialist where basic needs are guranteed and afterwards you can do whatever you want with your money. But that won't eliminate advertising and doesn't invalidate capitalism as a system for satisfying ever-becoming desires.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I support affordable healthcare because it is the right thing to do, and because the fact that your health coverage is tied to your job is just another link in the chain your boss has around your neck. I support civil rights and anti-racist policies because it is the right thing to do, and because the sooner the lower classes stop fighting with each other and unite against their common enemy the better. These reasons are why I support anti-sexist policies as well. I support ending the War on Drugs and prison reform because they are the right things to do, and because for too long these have been the tools the capitalist class use to put down those who threaten them.

"What I find so baffling about 'combating capitalism' or any other boogie monster is that there seems to be a lot of activists and not a lot of well... new politicians to replace the old ones. Recent protests especially in America have been absolutely pathetic on both sides. There's a lot of energy in the crowd of teens with bike-locks and scarves on their faces who like to counter protests veterans having a nice leisurely walk in the park with a few signs, but nobody to actually take responsibility for the change that they're going ape shit for. It feels like it's bratty kids doing what they learned to do at home to get what they want; throw a tantrum, but now they're no longer kids and the rules of the games are different. The youth of today don't seem to have any idea how good we have it with a capitalist system, there are plenty of people alive to tell of alternative systems and how it feels to live in the Soviet Union for example, not a lot of countries bordering Russia calling for revolution of capitalism any time soon.  For general purpose media where the subject is critique of capitalism or just capitalism there should really be a lot of caveats about how literally almost every positive thing about our society is also the product of capitalism, if you want to appear in good faith, not just spout 'work sucks lmao'. Taking good things for granted and then complaining at the few icky bits isn't helpful or even thought provoking for most, it's just plain misleading.  I think especially the American capitalism based system has a problem with longevity if there is too much swing towards one party in political power for too long, but other than that it's pretty freaking sweet compared to alternatives. I think the way forward is tweaks to it rather than a complete revolution and a dice roll on the viability of the new system with millions of deaths as a consequence of rolling snake eyes.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Not too mention the vast different methodologies for a structure within a society such as the theoretical liquid democracy and the ambiguous state capitalism. I personally think that it makes more sense to tackle these problems at the roots of their foundations, which isn't inherently capitalist but is often interpreted as such.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Love your videos. Glad to see a topic I finally disagree with. I think being a more social-politics oriented channel, you looked at this issue of a sociologist. I think from an economist's point of view, some aspects of capitalism begin to make more sense. (Although one could argue that the idea of an economist comes from capitalism, yada yada yada)  When rich people buy expensive things, that money doesn't just vanish. It's not like they're just offering it up to the lizard gods as a fuck you to all the poor people in the world. When a billionaire buys a million dollar boat, they provide income to the people that built the boat, the people that designed the boat, the people that built the electrical equipment inside the boat, and that money flows through all those companies down to the employees who never even came within a mile of the boat. That boat creates jobs for a possible captain and crew.  The basic flaw in capitalism is that because of its nature, some people will be forced to bear the brunt of consumerism, and endlessly want for things they don't need/can't afford.  I would say in a more refined world of capitalism, everyone would be given the education and tools to find a career that fulfills them. I think with the advent of the internet, we are approaching a world where that is becoming increasingly possible for the driven and motivated. With all the resources available online for cheap or free, the barriers to success are becoming smaller.  A non-capitalistic society is a big change, and I think it's great to hear criticisms of the system. However, I think an entire shift in how our world operates would, in the end, do more harm than good in the lives that it would destroy.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I agree that pragmatism and realism is part of good socialist political strategy, but I'm very disappointed Contra limited her analysis of capitalism to whatever is inside the imperial borders of the USA. Improving conditions and redestributing the wealth inside the empire, without having a plan for the phasing out of the exploitation of the world's southern hemisphere, which to a large extent produces this wealth in the first place, is just a kinder global imperialism. It makes the global proletariat's plight a fair price to pay for local equality. This is where the pragmatism of economic policy-oriented state-level strategy comes up against the most basic principle of solidarity, and where radical socdems like Sanders and Cortez will probably show their willingness to chauvinistically continuing the status quo outside local borders.

"I'm mostly with Tabby.  The best way to get her revolution is to just kick back and watch things get worse and worse as more and more people struggle to make ends meet. One way or another, this will end with blood in the streets and any wealthy person not smart enough to leave the country before things get rough will end up a bloodstain in the streets.  Even if the economic elites survive the riots, all of those pieces of paper they own will become worthless after society and the economy collapses and they will become the thing they hate the most: as poor as the rest of us.  We can avoid this if rich people and large corporations decide to stop being greedy shits and think about something more long term than next quarter's earnings report. That will never happen, so the bloodbath is inevitable.  We can avoid this if all Republicans and moderate Democrats admit that they are wrong and stop implementing economic policies that make things worse. Of course, they would rather watch their own children die at the hands of an angry mob than admit that they might be wrong about something so nothing can stop the bloodbath that is coming.  The people who have the power to stop this worked very hard to make sure no one has the power to stop them. If they don't want to prevent the bloodbath then we have no choice but to wait and watch it happen.  When the violence starts, I won't participate in any of the killings, nor will I personally set any mansions on fire, but I reserve the right to roast marshmallows over a mansion that is already on fire. I might as well get *something* out of what's coming.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Did you hear that sound ContraPoints? That was the sound of the hypocrisy bird landing on your head to make its nest in your well coiffed hair. Your critique of the wealthy is only valid if the U.S. were the only country in the world. Unfortunately for your argument, there are other countries in the world. And in those countries 71% of the worlds population lives off of $10, or less, per day. By comparison to someone who lives off of $2 per day you are an absolute gazillionaire! The angst you feel when comparing yourself to Warren Buffett is that exact same angst that hundreds of millions of people in the developing world feel when comparing themselves to you. The inescapable conclusion is that you are one of the goddamned, bloodsucking, reptiles. You are the employer appropriating the work of the developing world for your selfish gain. No amount of lies or self-delusion is going to save you from what you know to be true. Every criticism you level at the lizard people, however valid, is a criticism you are leveling at yourself, as one of the lizard people. Perhaps this video was nothing more than a desperate attempt to assuage the guilt you feel for having so much when others have so little. By trying to deflect your guilt to others you are screaming to the impoverished of the world, 'Spare me for having so much more than you, because these nonhuman lizard people have more than I do!'

Nature even worse doesn't ever give a fuck about you. Your happiness is up to you. In a capitalistic society, you more or less can choose what you do. In a socialist society, this is dictated to you.   You are smart and talented, but your studies of philosophy are not the same as studies in economics. You need to study the latter to really make sense of anything. I do enjoy whatever weird ass vibe you have.   I said it before, the only people I know who don't like capitalism are the ones who didn't do stem in college and can't figure out how to monetize their liberal arts skills. You have figured out how to do it! See! Wasn't so hard was it? Good luck being able to do this as you are today in a socialist society. Wouldn't happen. Dollars are simply an expression of value that you have converted from your inputs (work, talent) into real world outputs (products, services).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"A lot of these criticisms are valid. However, they elide the fact that capitalism is responsible for lifting the whole world out of poverty at an unprecedented rate. The unfortunate reality is that the Pareto Principle dictates that the more wealth being generated consequently gives rise to greater inequality. While this might provide an objective rise in the standard of living it's also at odds with the Gini Coefficient, which is a statistical measure of inequality with a strong positive correlation with civil unrest and violent crime. As a species we dislike wealth, because we'll always feel we aren't getting enough of it, that we're entitled to some arbitrary portion. It's genuinely a shame.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a capitalist I disagree with you on some things but you bring up good points and are well explained. Also the production value is awesome. I think my biggest issue with socialism is nation wide socialism in a place as vast as America. Take New Jersey which has a large autistic population, given a free healthcare system for example, it  would be better donating money towards that whilst other states may not. A federal government would have a hard time adapting to that, and the US federal government is way to hard to make not corrupt whilst you can treat states in a more capitalistic manner. So if for example my state PA goes corrupt we can move and not pay taxes to the corrupt government there.  As much as a capitalist as I am I will be the first to admit it has flaws, and as many pro capitalists have pointed out, capitalism should not be equivalent to anarchy. Places like medicine and education (department of education is an example of money buying politics) should be regulated.  Either way I hope we can find a middle ground that can take the best of both systems and build a society that is truly fair, disciplined, and allows for the most opportunity, cheers. Edit: also good point with the rational decision issue with economics and even when building political systems. which why I think that if we try socialism on a small scale there can be an out if it doesn't work.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There is something about the statement 'capitalism relies on the state to exist' (paraphrasing) that feels like a disingenuous characterization of reality. In order for capitalism to exist in its purest and most potent form, the only laws required are 1.) you can own things, and 2.) you cannot steal.The resulting hierarchies that emerge out of what is effectively just (anarchy + property rights) is a testament to the usefulness of markets as a decentralized strategy for producing an unexpectedly just society, relatively speaking. Those at the top of the hierarchies produced by markets typically only seek to MINIMIZE the power of the state via attempts at deregulation and lowering of taxes. The extent to which such entities are willing to use the state in order to bolster their position in the hierarchy (via mechanisms such as patent law) would only ever be described as an anti-capitalist departure from free markets.  Communism and socialism, however, derive the entirety of their power to produce hierarchies (or lack thereof) from the authority of the state. This is because socialism and communism are prescriptive in the outcomes they seek to produce, whereas capitalism is not. If the resulting structure of a capitalist society is that all the individuals at the top of the hierarchy were to radically redistribute their wealth a la Bill Gates or Warren Buffet, this would be no more or less capitalist than were they to double down on maximizing their position in the hierarchy.  It therefore felt as though what you meant to say was not that capitalism is dependent on the state to exist, but rather that the avenue via which you'd like to COMBAT capitalism is dependent on the state. There is a cynical argument that could be made that you willfully associated the market authority of successful capitalists with the authority of the state in an attempt to utilize a general anti-authoritarian sentiment that people have, but any further departure from free markets would only be done under an increase in authoritarian policy. I'm not saying this is either a good or a bad thing, I just don't feel like it was characterized correctly.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Have you ever met a wealthy, successful entrepreneur? Do you know a single person who made themselves wealthy? I'm asking because this is a two way street. Rich people are not inhuman leeches who should pay up or fuck off.  Chief lizards provide value by building an organization that can pay more people. You might hate the CEO, but very often nobody would have a job at all without them (hint for the dummies reading, $0/hour is worse than $14/hour). Not as true in the largest companies, but this is DEFINITELY true in the numerical majority of businesses. Get a real job or start a real company and you'll see what I mean.  The fact is, in America you can still get rich with hard work, inventiveness and intelligence. This is a rare combination so naturally there are not a huge number of people who enrich themselves in a given generation.  Inequality is inevitable. Stop whining about it and read some books instead. If you read the right books, you'll get paid more! (anything by Bell Hooks is the wrong book. Introduction to C++ is the right book). If you spend a lot of time whinging on the internet, chances are your time management sucks. If your time management sucks, you will not be successful. Here's another hint for any dummies reading- success requires years and years of sustained hard work. Most people have no idea how to work hard for an entire hour, much less a decade.  One last note: 'Capitalism needs the state to maintain its power.' No. Again, this is a two way street. Our government would not have the astronomical budget that it does without the taxes paid by the beneficiaries of a highly successful capitalist economy. One hand feeds the other. That's why I say your diagnosis is flat wrong. A democratic republic can manage a capitalist economy just fine up to the point when corruption sets in. The issue is not capitalism, the issue is corruption of the government by corporatists (a corporatist and capitalist are not the same).  Not the last note. Pretty much everything on your channel revolves around genitalia and skin tone (that I've seen so far. Haven't seen a whole ton). People with political views like yours strike me as developmentally blocked. Unable to form an identity around transcendental ideas (like truth, wisdom, the pursuit of knowledge), instead these spiritually inhibited types look down and say 'gee a vagina, gee dark skin. I guess that's who I am! Time to get political!' The deepest navel gazing produces the shallowest personalities.   Oh, and if nobody had guessed, the white nationalist resurgence is due to intersectional theory propagating from academia to society at large. Navel gazing dipshittery among the minorities and women has caused a few white men to fall into the same idiotic rut. So, enjoy the alt-right, all of you intersectionalists. They are your baby, your brain-child, and every day they are thankful that you're fighting their fight (identically) from across the aisle. They're thankful because once the fight truly breaks out, they will win (you guys have feelings, those guys have guns. Get the picture?)  Anyway, I hope your part two has some recommendations for a solution, because otherwise you're just whining about something you think is broken without a clue how to fix it. That's childish to its very core.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'When you use David Icke's vocabulary aren't you discrediting yourself'? I am merely a bunny. I could not dream of having such a response.  The answer is simply no. Because there are multiple intents and messages when one uses these words. When you pretend to be a conspiracy theorist, you are in effect calling someone out for a tactic that they will try to use to discredit you. You're saying, 'discrediting people for being a conspiracy theorist is wrong'.  Because sometimes a paid shill would actually call you out and accuse you of being a conspiracy theorist, all you're doing is disarming them, before it happens. When they then call you a conspiracy theorist, the 'freshness' of that accusation is challenged. People are not shocked by it. They don't as immediately jump to the conclusion that you're just a conspiracy theorist, because they already know before it happens, that this argument is silly.  At least that's one way, but it's another thing too. It's that you're challenging the idea that people can't understand your reasoning based on the words and their associations that you are using. You know that the argument you're making by itself may have merit, and just because you're using David Icke's words, it doesn't mean that your argument is wrong.  Basically, you can walk and talk like David Icke, whilst coming off as totally sane. Because the audience is aware that you are more sane than David Icke is. They know that when David Icke is talking about the lizard people he is being literal, and you know when she talks about lizard people that she is talking about capitalists whilst dismissing the idea you shouldn't, because of preconceived notions that those who question capitalists are conspiracy theorists.  You see how that works right?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Capitalism cannot end because it is ingrained into the human existence. I mean that there is no world without 'capital'. What IS capital? Is capital just money? No. Capital is everything, capital is you looking good, you have 'looking good' capital. That's an innate value in the condition of being you. When you're strong, that strength is capital. People want your capital for themselves. They want what you have. This is why capitalism isn't something that was ever removed from the world, even among communist societies.  As capital existed in the social capital of Stalin, his capital was that people listened to him. If you took away Stalin's tangible ability to lead people, it would be that people listened to him. And then what are you left with? Well, as soon as anyone begins to work at anything at life, or exceed you, inequity is born. They have created capital, and you will create your own capital, this means that it is not tenable, not realistic, to abolish capitalism.  It would be like trying to abolish 'need'. You want post-scarcity. But as you know, there is no scientific way at the moment to create energy for free. There is no current way to make a resource from nothing, and without it, 'capital' will be present in every system of humanity, no matter what. Whether it's a monarchy, a communist society, or a capitalist society.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Well, when we say reptile brain we're trying to refer to the parts of our brain we associate with base desires and emotions human beings experience.  So when you say the 'reptilians are running the planet', you're not correct in a literal sense. But you're not wrong that people who are influenced by the reptile remnants of their brain which govern the processes of fear are running the planet. Pretty good, huh? I don't know.

"This is my opinion: Capitalism has a lot of problems, but it is the best system we have. There are just no good alternatives. Communism and socialism obviously don't work (and yes they do NOT work, if you want to argue with that point feel free to do so and I'll try and convince you otherwise), so we are left with only one economic doctrine. Of course, pure laissez faire capitalism is just as bad as communism since we end up with a sort of social darwinism, where monopolies control the economy and leave everybody else to rot. What we need is capitalism with some trust-busting and big business busting laws, ensuring the free market is not dominated by either the state or huge corporations.  Karl Marx made a lot of good points about pure capitalism, and I would even go as far to say that he was right about it. However, the alternative that he gives is much worse. I mean, ya'll are complaining about hundreds of thousands of people barely scraping by working soul crushing jobs, while in the Soviet Union and Communist China millions of people were dying of starvation or being deported to prison camps. We must find a balance between pure capitalism and socialism, where there is a prosperous free market with plenty of competition and no dominating corporations. Of course, that's not an easy thing to accomplish.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

If a job isn't very fun then a lot of people won't try to get that job, and there will be a higher demand for those who do, and people will get paid more for doing things that others would rather not do that needs to get done, which will attract more people to that job.

"You raise good points, a quote I find hilarious from the Communists is this. 'They will sell us the noose we use to hang them!' Capitalism has always been profit first, with things like the Trading Companies of the Colonial Era being some of the more powerful Entities next to Governments. Current Day economic Situations is made worse because, sadly, the average Citizen ALLOWS themselves to be manipulated by adds. I don't mean this in the way of saying 'OH, I'm smarter than you and make better choices' I buy Plastic Crack (40k Miniatures) for Gods sake! But we have to make better choices with our money. I don't rent because I need to save up, I have a plan 5-6 years ahead, I plan on making my own business (small of course) and all that stuff, but the main disadvantage the Common Worker faces is that he is alone, while the wealthier businesses have ENTIRE TEAMS to cut through the Red Tape. Low skill high Pay Jobs no longer exists, and minimum wage jobs are becoming rarer and rarer. So in my admittedly small experience in the world of economics, there's 2 ways to grow. Work Harder than everyone else, which is how I've been working and has worked out so far. Or create your own business. The third Option is subsistence living which I honestly think could make a comeback at some Point. We must also be willing to sacrifice personal Luxiries. I have an used car, I only buy the clothes I need, and I've used the same phone for 4+ years. I try to cut costs where I can (don't eat out much and try to use as little gas as possible) and I have a growing bank account and still some for my Crack. I understand in the States it's different, but honestly, as long as you work and provide for the Family, living with your parents may well be a necessary step.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

You could imagine a capitalist society where advertising is highly regulated and restricted, where there are strong unions and labor protections making jobs less shitty and less time consuming, where people aren't burdened by student or medical debt, and where mega corporations don't just take everything over. In fact, such societies do exist, such as Sweden and Denmark. They are still capitalist, just a different kind of capitalist. They still have private ownership and distribute a large portion of goods and services through markets. I can get on board with that. That's why I did like the end of this video, where you focused on more practical stuff.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The purchase or subsidization of a homeless person could be marketed as an art project.  The owners of these projects would get an annual report on their subject. A huge photo to hang somewhere, of course.  All the money would be refunded upon the demise of the homeless person (feasible?), since there will always be 'fresh meat,' as it were.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm wondering if she took macro or microeconomics in college. Right now I'm taking microeconomics and my professor and my textbook are surprisingly pro-capitalism. I wasn't really partial to any economic system went I went into college; however, after taking microeconomics, capitalism seems to be the economic system that makes the most sense. I do agree that it has its problems, but socialism causes even more problems and causes more people to be poor. While capitalism produces many poor people, the poorest person under capitalism is richer than the poorest person under socialism, and, ultimately, I think everyone wants the poor to be as well off as possible. I honestly don't think there's any perfect economic system that will resolve poverty, because the root of poverty is not in which economic system we use, but in the tendency of humans to take advantage of other humans. I believe that if humans acted in a moral fashion, any economic system would work; however, since humans are naturally greedy and competitive, an economic system that takes these traits into account is most likely the best one.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Guess what, Marx was a daydreaming bourgeois. Recycling what one man said 150 years ago without any revision is as reasonable as citing economics of150 years ago to explain today's economic state. Oh wait.   What you call capitalism is the world people themselves create. A few people owning most of capital is nothing new at all. Curing diseases, lifting people out of poverty on a global scale, enabling people to enjoy their human rights to be the gender they want to be and have sex with the people they want to on such a large scale is on the other hand quite novel. Granted, this has been largely due to the development of sciences and social rights movements but such movements and academia were able to grow in the somewhat free market economy (with a healthy dose of regulation from government).    As much as I despise CEOs making millions of dollars for working for the same amount of time as me, I realize that this is not the fault of 'capitalism', which is something that was birthed a few centuries ago but rather human nature, societal hierarchies and the complexity of life. Convoluted ideological dogmas only make the point harder to see. Our decision making and ownership systems fail because we have no accountability - people in power are rarely brought to justice when they abuse it. Thus they are allowed to abuse capital and then wash their hands away.  On a positive note, she is quite talented and meticulous.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

When the gullible buy it, we get Trump. Oh, and to top it off...they like to sell the idea of them paying less taxes, while at the same time promising more money for everyone else as a job.

"Hey, I think you're wrong about adverting. Most adverting is aimed at reaching an audience with certain needs/desires for the service or product, that's why google analytics is so valuable, it lets advertisers target their ads to the people who already want their category of product.   A Tesco ad for pork targeted at a vegan is wasted money and no amount of it is going to persuade them to buy it there. However, a meat eater might choose to go to Tesco next time for that instead of some other store. I hated it but I worked in advertising for years and this is most of what companies do. A pretty small portion outside of premium TV ad space is this sort of basic 'let the people know we exist' sort.  Obviously there is a lot of image creation inside all of that but it's not necessarily lying if companies are policed to make sure they don't (they try all the time anyway) and the presentation of an image isn't necessarily a falsehood but an accurate portrayal of what kind of company you might shop/use/go into business with. And yeah some portion is made by wastes of space trying to convince people they need something totally unnecessary but no one would say clothes, food, furniture, cars and banking is unnecessary (not coincidentally our largest clients). Ultimately the purpose of advertising (theoretically) is to make consumers aware of their choices and present them with more information to make their decisions with, rendering them a more 'rational' consumer though I have no idea if that's actually the case.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Good man. Far right and Far left unites in the shadows of the main discourse over precisely the point of spirit. Though viewed from two different angles, both recognise the spirit. Perhaps the horseshoe theory is somewhat right if we put the human soul there at the end where the two points meet.   Although fascism and communism only see one side of the soul and a new perspective is needed, the liberal capitalist democracy while having the best perspective is also the furthest away, seeing nothing but a foggy reflection of something that then soon enough falls out of collective memory. So it ends up creating a thousand replicas for the satisfaction of the soul, all of which never come close but all of which we keep consuming; for the lack of a better alternative.  We need to envelop the soul again in a syncretic ideology apt for the 21:st century. In doing so we must somehow include the good aspects of capitalism which enabled the engine of individual creativity to sprint away while cleaning it of all the pollution and destruction it creates in the wake of its desperate search for meaning.  (Out of this syncretic movement, discord will erupt and new developments will happen but for a while we need the unification of ideology the way it happened in the late 19th century. We need to form the nexus of a new big bang instead of trying to grasp at these stars that are ever more distant and irrelevant).  PS: I don't think it's reptiles (i.e. evil capitlists) selling you what they want. It's just mostly normal people who saw needs and a way to fulfill them. They just did it better than some other people. In some cases they were corrupt or nepotistic, but wickedness dwells in all classes of people, even you and me. It is the reason for all of these 'needs' is what needs more exploring.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The Lizards comparison is effective (and btw those masks and gloves are of stellar quality) and the prevalence of conspiracy theories needs to be taken seriously. Much of David Icke's audience are people like me who enjoy it 'ironically' because it's like watching a sci fi reality show. However, I sat down with one of his exhaustively long lectures and it was hours before he got to the reptilians. He spent a huge amount of time pointing out problems in society and the despair of the human soul under capitalism that Marx and Contra talk about in this video, with of course some differences and inaccuracies (dear lord the anti-vaxxer shit). Point is, Icke's audience, and almost all conspiracy theories when they're not leftover anti-semitic babble that didn't die with the Nazis, come from the same 'something is wrong and we're being screwed over' feeling. I doubt all of Icke's fans literally believe alien lizards control the world- some definitely do, I've met them, and I've also met ones who just like how he explains what's wrong with the world (when he's not going on about Saturn and connecting every unconnected symbol in the world to it).   The main reason his stuff works is because the workers and common people of capitalist societies are not just alienated from the product of their labor, they're alienated from their rulers. Think about it, how many employees of large companies ever meet the CEO, or anyone directly under him? How many Government employees ever meet the President or the Chiefs of Staff? How many people who don't work in those fields ever meet the people making decisions about the society they live in and how it will treat them? How many people watching TV news meet the people who make it? It's just... there. Close enough to see but far away.   I've lived in America and Australia, and currently as an adult in Aus, we've got some housing issues- namely that millennials can't afford them. We all rent. barely any of us have ever met our landlords. I interviewed for a share house where the landlord was a foreign investor who didn't care what went on in the house as long as he got his money. There are people with enough power to make decisions that affect whether people live or die overnight, like voting against universal healthcare or cutting wages, and they're so far away in a physical sense, and the things they do are so cruel and inhuman that they might as well be alien lizards. We know this ruling class exist, but in the same way we know the moon exists. Or do we? One of the reasons I think the moon landing conspiracy is so alive and well is because almost no one on the planet will ever go there. It's there, it affects us, but it's really far away. So of course when languishing in the shit jobs you never see the product of, you think 'where's this going? Who's directing all of this? How can I know that what I'm told in answer to that is true? Is anyone directing this at all? If they are, how can they be human and create such a hell for us and gilded palaces for them?'   Of course, they must be Lizards. Because no human can be that bad.   Trouble is, they can. And they are. And they're capitalists. The worst people most of us will never meet.   Oh and before it's pointed out, yes the Reptillian stuff (although it is literal space aliens in Icke's beliefs) does have roots in anti-semitic conspiracy theories, and Icke does reference the protocols of the elders of zion, yet that has almost no effect on why people are drawn to it now, in huge numbers. He's not using them as metaphors for jews, he thinks they are literal space aliens. Yet for people drawn to it, the metaphor for lizards as capitalists works, and the metaphor for lizards as jews, well it might work for the alt-right but that's not really Icke's fanbase, they're more the Jones crowd. Every Icke fan I've talked to starts from the point of 'something is wrong and society is killing us' and it comes back to that. But we never meet the people who are killing us. So maybe they are lizards.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"4:54 ''I'm really more of a pursuit of individual happiness person''. This contradicts everything you say about capitalism. Because a world without capitalism is a world without money. Capitalism is the expression of a human society using money. And a world without money, is a world without individualism. A world where people live in small communities, in rural or semi-rural areas, work together to produce what they need (and simply what they need), in a permacultural philosophy (recycling everything, not wasting anything), respecting mother nature, etc. It's a world where only the community has any importance, individual happiness is not a goal. Though, we would be a hundred times happier in this kind of society than we are now in this capitalit world. But capitalism is an entropic system, and it's going to end.

"I think you may want to consider renaming this video to 'What's wrong with american capitalism?' or 'What's wrong with corporatism?' I don't know why, but alot of people in the US look at scandinavian countries and say: 'Ha! See, that is evil socialism!' or 'Ha! See, socialism works!' but in fact, every single western country, including the scandinavian ones use the capitalist economic system, not a socialist one, they simply regulate it well and tax it heavily to provide a strong welfare system, however it is still a capitalist system as the means of production is still privately owned. You still have consumerism, you still have millionaires, you still have greedy executives, but these things don't bother people because their basic needs ARE provided for and their rights have proper protections.   The main problem in the US isn't capitalism itself, it's the corruption of capitalism and your government caused by the lack of regulation to prevent these things. What you have is much closer to corporatism, masquerading as capitalism, and honestly at this point its gone so far that it's going to be very hard to change that short of a revolution, which is why I understand the appeal for socialist and fascist revolutionaries on both sides of the spectrum, but I'm afraid if either of those things came to pass it may end up only making things worse, history is pretty clear on that, fighting a revolution just in the name of reforming your corporatism into social democracy capitalism on the other hand, while in my opinion it being the best option(although, I object to bloody revolutions wherever plausible), is unrealistic as well, because it's hard to create a revolution out of such a mild ideology. People want to flock to extreme ideologies, which is what tends to cause the problems.  In conclusion, the US is kind of fucked, but I just urge you to remember, that you're still a first world nation and that as bad as the problems might seem right now they CAN get alot, alot worse just by you trying to do something about it. That's not to say that you shouldn't, but you should exercise extreme caution.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I suggest we move to change the incentives for corporations. As it stands now they are required BY LAW to maximise investor returns, dividends and short-term profits. The incentives are all to exponentially increase the rate of growth at the expense of and to the exclusion of all other incentives or objectives. CEOs of publicly traded companies have been ejected by their boards for prioritizing the environment or employee well-being over shareholder profit. This is where Congress can and must act in a way that cannot be misinterpreted by the courts. People want 'person' defined in a way that elevates self aware human beings over animate objects or corporate legal fictions. Worker profit and public expense for tax sweeteners & environmental cleanup must be factored into the corporate equation. We are subsidizing the bejesus out of enormous executive salaries and share buybacks. All the mistakes of the Roaring Twenties Plus technology for day trading! Just remember we ain't seen nothing yet when it comes to new algorithms people are going to write.

"Learning from a liberal about how capitalism works, is like learning from the church how athiests think. Or learning from the Government what anarchy is (especially one that's admitted that they have very little academic interaction with 'Right Wing' philosophies, even though I dispute the idea of right and left wing).  If i agreed with her understanding of this current paradigm then I'd agree with the assessment of Capitalism. But there's fundamental disagreements about A.) what Capitalism is, B.) how and why this current form or economic system is completely unrelated to capitalism, and C.) how teaching college students, and especially little children in government grade school, that this current form of economic system is capitalism, is a form of propaganda that's purposely/accidentally misrepresenting the idea of Capitalism to children and also misrepresenting the current system. You can't have capitalism when the businesses are allowed to prevent competition by using government regulations and 'Lobbying'. You can't have capitalism when the vast majority of competition is prevented by NON-market forces such as the force of police (including taxes and fees and regulations) and the force of governement...

"I remember the first time I truly started to despise capitalism was when I got a job working in a makeup factory. All employees were on a rotation so I was never on the same line twice in a row, but at least once a week I'd get put on the line responsible for producing Cover FX foundation. The rate at which we produced the foundation was overwhelming, usually averaging out to one piece produced every 3 seconds. I remember this line specifically because it was the only line where I ever saw the product in stores, where it would sell for around $50. Since I was paid minimum wage ($14 CAD) this meant I would need to work 4 hours to be able to buy something I made every 3 seconds.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'End Capitalism.' Yeah. Yeah, that's some plan. Given that capitalism is just the set of behaviors that emerge from a system in which property rights are protected (i.e. people and groups of people are allowed to own things, and the government enforces contracts and punishes things like theft and fraud), 'ending' capitalism can mean all sorts of things. Anti-trust laws, prohibitions against banks printing their own currency, and the criminalization of drug sales and ownership are already common anti-capitalist laws (i.e. laws that abrogate certain forms of freedom of ownership). So when you say you want to 'end capitalism', that's not a very clear statement until you say which additional types of ownership you want to restrict or prohibit. Like, should people not be allowed to own things jointly (i.e. no corporations)? Do you want only the government to be allowed to own land and buildings? What about other objects like factory equipment, printing presses, dump trucks, jack-hammers, normal hammers, clothing, food, and photographs? Is there still money? Are people allowed to lend? Is there a limit to how much an individual is allowed to own?  'Ending capitalism' really means ending freedom of ownership (to at least one extent or another), and I'm really curious to know which specific freedoms advocates of ending capitalism want to do away with and why. (Maybe the freedom to form employer-employee relationships, if those are viewed as always exploitative?)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Unwarranted political opinion: We're a geographically big country with a lot of ignorant people living unhealthy habits and entrenched in religion (75% of us are Christian).  Socialized medicine would only work if people took care of themselves so minimal strain would be put on the system.  Also the individualistic and selfish culture does't help (e.g. people thinking having their own villas to be a normal aspiration.)  I feel this leads to the whole rich/well off people conspicuously consuming with no self-awareness with their gaudy choices that piss people off with their poor valueless taste.  People in this country need to (some how) become less ignorant, and be encouraged to take hobbies/skills and collaborate to create value.  Giving economic power to the State will not fix things.  I totally agree the privatized healthy system and mass incarceration are a scorn on this country though.   But I'm assuming you're video is somewhat tongue in cheek anyways so props to that.

"I watched a video recently by Knowing Better entitled 'The Dirtiest Words in Economics' I didn't find them in there. For me the dirtiest words would have to be 'Primitive Accumuilation' aka for Marx 'the social division of labour' but a better interpretation is 'state sponsored organised crime'. If one goes back to the beginning of Capitalism or to its invention the 'invisible hand of the market' was insufficient for the conditions necessary for capitalism to take seed. Far from the 'laissez-faire' approach the government took a hands on approach. New legal frameworks became the tools to enforce the changes in society. It became legalised violence because the very astute folks in England preferred a life of free time than the possession of manufactured goods. They could not be persuaded to go into wage-labour.  Capitalism and the 'economic rationality' that the state adopted was not just about kicking the people off their traditional lands and into factories and jobs. Resources taken other than land included self-representation, art, methods of using plants, sources of water, intellectual property rights the list just goes on... For an honest description of this read Sir James Steuart's 'An Inquiry into the Principles of Political Economy'. Unlike the apologist John Adams who skips over it, the brutal reality is written in this book.  Edit: Whoops... Of course I meant Adam Smith and his 'The Wealth of Nations... ' and not John Adams. These mistakes tend to happen when I go on a ramble.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I honestly think welfare capitalism is the way forward, the most I would condone is social democracy but socialism is bullshit. Socialism doesn't work for 2 main reasons in my opinion:  1) People are lazy, they are not out for the good of humanity and it would be a large ask for everyone to band together and behave selflessly for the good of the race. People have a hard time doing that now when there are a million and one ways to make money in a capitalistic society, so I don't see the overwhelming amount of people doing it out of the goodness of their hearts.  2) Another main flaw I see in your approach is what do we define as a standard of living which is acceptable for someone who has done little to contribute. In my opinion, basic (and good) education, accessible higher education (not free), accessible healthcare (again not free), freedom of speech and affordable housing. What many people, albeit not all, ask for on the left is what advertisement has lead them to want. I'm from dead on centre of the middle class, my family works for what it has and I am happy we are rewarded for it but we still put in hours at work and develop ourselves within our family to make sure we can have finer things. We could equally make less of a contribution and lead a less extravagant life - and by that I mean eating out less, not $2000 on a new computer (we ain't got caviar money lol).  I agree that some people get too much money, I agree that higher education is too high, and I agree that we need to look after people where we can, but socialism is not the answer. Ultimately, a lot of people in high paying positions worked their assess off to be there and you have people like Bill Gates and Elon Musk pouring their money back into good causes. Capitalism works, but it needs a certain amount of regulating which I think would be offered by welfare capitalism.  Just my two cents, I appreciate the video and the points made.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Let's get things clear. You acknowledge the middle class white guy is being bugged in his man cave where he no longer enjoy his computer games in peace. But that there are other groups that are even more bugged is nonsense. Maybe the queers, I'll give you that. But just look at the amount of feminist legislation in the west (I'm not talking right to abortion or other reasonable stuff), but guardianship law, or how the money is divided between divorced parents. It's unfair. The middle class white guy already had to work, pay most taxes in the country, and had to acknowledge his girl was in charge of a large part of the house hold. But he at least had the pride of being the provider .. and his man cave. The prior is semi-gone, and the latter is endangered. And a modern feminist woman will want to force a guy to take half of the responsibility for the kids too. Should the relationship fail, the chances are he'll see his kids maybe 1 or 2 hours per week, unless he adamantly fights for them. And if his ex doesn't work, she'll get a free lawyer, courtesy of dad (or his money). You see what's wrong here?   Capitalism may have ruined the classical landscape .. sprinkled with idyllic villages.. and replaced them with burger joints and parking lots. (So, join the lbgt amish.) But capitalism did more for civilization than anything. Marx was a good critic, but his alternatives are far worse. They just don't work. The proof is everywhere. 100 years of communist failings. Oh how terrible it is to compete, to be forced to do actual work. To be bullied around if you're the new guy, or underperform. The arguments in your video remind me of a typical punk pop song. It never extends beyond feeling good about your criticism. Once you grow beyond your twenties, you'll probably leave that behind, though. Because it leads to unhappiness..   I agree there is gross inequality in the USA. There are billionaires that have 2 cars, 1 house, and 3 manager pants, and do nothing but keep their capital in the bank. On the other hand there's Bill Gates. And even loathed industrial leaders like Henry Ford actually introduced the 40 hour work week and stuff that was affordable for all, instead of the party leaders. Capitalism is something inconvenient, but it's a reality, and it will never go away until _everything_ is completely automated. However, you can add some socialist stuff on top like affordable healthcare, I grant you that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Abortion could be viewed as a means of population control to limit the growth of the working class; a working class who are increasingly less needed as laborers for corporations because of the increase in automation etc. Abortion could then be considered a capitalist solution to having a working class which may require a welfare state going forward.

"That 'we are all autonomous individuals making rational choices for our own well-being' is not, and has never been a 'fundamental assumption of capitalist society.' This is like a caricature of capitalism being regurgitated by an 8th grader who's been told too many times they're beyond their years by lefty parents.  While capitalism, vis-a-vis free market economics, requires a respect of bodily autonomy and autonomy in the sense of freedom of choice and freedom of voluntary association, it does not treat individuals as insular, but in fact emphasizes how we benefit both ourselves and others through specialization, which comes alongside increasing interdependence commensurate to the level of specialization we achieve.   It does not assume that we make rational choices all the time--on the contrary, it emphasizes that individual values and preferences are subjective, and do not always conform with the values and preferences that authorities or majorities would consider to be rational, like maximizing one's well-being, long-term happiness, or financial gain. Its main insight is that because of this fact, these is so much information about how scarce resources can be optimally allocated to meet as many human desires as possible which remains trapped and dispersed at the individual or even subconscious level that it's impossible to conceive of a managed system that can credibly be expected to meet human desires and improve human welfare more efficiently than the imperfect laissez faire system of letting people make their own sometimes-irrational decisions in pursuit of their own happiness and values. The laissez faire system allows that essential information about subjective individual preferences to be communicated throughout society via stigmergy while a managed system tries to pretend that this information doesn't even matter, and thus ends up causing huge economic disruptions and malinvestments that harm the most vulnerable in society (at the shallow end,) or ends up miserably failing to efficiently allocate even the most basic resources for their most basic functions in society, causing mass deprivation and starvation (at the deep end.)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The DPRK most certainly bombards people with advertising, and I'm not just referring to your usual totalitarian political propoganda channels. For command economy planners, huge swaths of resources are deployed to produce outputs that are entirely symbolic and propogandistic in their very nature (e.g. skyscraper hotels that don't house anyone, giant dams that cause flooding, guiness world  record setting gymnastic parades) all at the actual expense of basic goods and services. So I'm fine with letting coca cola 'waste' resources and try their best to marginally nudge their sales numbers with advertising if, at the end of the day, they are still turning resources into somethimg people want. If you wish to liberate people from the 'clutches' of advertising, nothing wrong or even uncapitalistic with providing some spiritual education to endow people with the tools to do so. You may even be able to charge people for it and use advertising to spread the word about it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"My professor at University of Queensland, Bruce Littleboy, stated in a lecture, that if he married his housekeeper, the countries GDP would go down if she continued to do the exact same work.  The same applies to many things.  People drive safer? Less accidents, meaning less medical bills and less vehicle repairs, meaning lower GDP.  Less gunshot wounds from crime?  Less medical costs meaning lower GDP.  Less child abuse? Fewer councilling services demanded and lower GDP.  Depressed because you can't find work? You pay money to a psychiatrist paying a higher marginal tax rate than you would if you had a job.  Sadly, it also means less tax revenue, giving governments an inherent incentive to do sweet fuck all to prevent the aforementioned horrible things.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hmm... I see that capitalism has given you a luxury of choice in food and made it affordable as well and now you're overeating yourself! That's not healthy! Shame on those capitalist swine! But rest assure, I have a solution it's called The Marxist Diet!  All you have to do is to get the government to undermine and abolish private property rights and you will soon enjoy the delicious taste of dogs, cats, rats and birds as well as vegan options such as bark, corn kernels and grass! And toilet paper will most likely be in chronically short supply so you'll want to take it easy on the food. There is also an exercise regimen! Since won't be able to afford a car or probably mass transit either you'll just have to walk or jog. How does this diet work, you may ask. It's quite simple really, it takes most of the food and gives it to the government. The best part is that once you're in, you can never go back no matter how desperately you want to! So go out and impose this new diet plan on your society today!

"A response in five parts to What's Wrong with Capitalism Alternate video title - You are a victim with no responsibility for your own actions Chapter 1 alternate title - You are a victim of capitalism Natalie says young people have an experience of a 'capitalist malaise' in this country.  A malaise is 'a general feeling of discomfort, illness, or uneasiness whose exact cause is difficult to identify.'  Natalie implies that citizens of socialist countries do not experience malaise.  This is true.  The reason for this is in the definition of the word.  In socialist countries, historically speaking, feelings of discomfort, illness and unease have a precise and obvious cause, namely, the government that is oppressing them and taking away their freedom every day of their lives.   The malaise that young people experience in America is the terrifying freedom they have over their own lives and the concomitant responsibility for the choices they make as citizens of a free society.  What is Natalie's solution?  Take away our freedom!  It is true that this will remove the feelings of malaise young people face, but it is at the expense of the freedom we all enjoy.  This antidote comes in two parts; stupidity and evil.  The stupid aspect of socialism is ignoring the overall benefits to society brought about by capitalism and the ridiculously great quality of life we enjoy in this country when compared to most of the world, particularly evidenced by the high income Americans have, and the ability for all people to make good economic choices and succeed in our country.  The evil part of socialism is attempting to deny freedom to the population as a whole because some people are terrified of their freedoms.  The result of socialism is that all people in a socialist society are dragged down into a common misery from which they cannot rescue themselves.  While freedom is scary, oppression (dictator socialism) or infantilization (nanny state socialism) are scarier to the intelligent mind and the independent spirit.  Please don't trade uneasiness about your freedom for oppression or infantilization.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Part 2: Chapter 2 alternate title - You are a victim of the man who pays your bills Natalie says your unhappiness in life is due to your shitty job.  Guess what?  If you have a shitty job, GET A NEW ONE!  Start a business.  Become a Youtuber.  Get an education.  The hypocrisy found in Natalie's view expressed on a Youtube video is rich.  How does Natalie earn income?  From Youtube.  How does Youtube pay her?  From advertising revenue.  What is the third chapter of her video about?  The evils of advertising!!!  Come on sheeple, just think logically for ten seconds of your life about this.  Natalie uses capitalism to enrich herself and enjoys the benefits of capitalism (Domino's pizza, Kate Spade shoes and income from clicks on her video) while railing against capitalism.  L...O...L.  Remember that thing we talked about in part 1 about living in a free society?  MONETIZE IT LIKE NATALIE DOES!  Use it to better your circumstances.  Do you have interests, talents, intelligence?  Monetize it LIKE NATALIE DOES.  Educate yourself.  Make yourself valuable to society and society will repay you.  If you already have an education but your degree is in a useless field, get a better education that actually assists you in finding gainful employment.  Ask any of the Chinese, Russians and North Koreans who FLED their socialist utopias to come to America and enjoy freedom how much dignity they found in the labor they were assigned without choice by their authoritarian governments.  Take charge of your situation and better your own life.  It's your freedom and your right.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Part 3:  Chapter 3 alternate title - 'You are a victim of advertising' Natalie says you are a victim of the advertisements you are bombarded with on a daily basis.  This claim is almost too dumb to warrant a response.  First of all, you are personally responsible for your own consumer choices in a capitalist state.  If you squander your money on Domino's pizza and Kate Spade shoes instead of taking care of your essential needs, you will suffer.  This is the danger of living in a free society.  But, you are responsible for making good choices with your money.   Obviously the Domino's shtick is meant to be funny, but the unfunny aspect of it is that the $17 that virtually all Americans have to spend on great things like Domino's pizza and lava cakes (thanks to capitalism) is equal to the TOTAL DAILY MEDIAN INCOME OF AN ENTIRE FAMILY LIVING IN THE SOCIALIST UTOPIA OF CHINA.  If China had spent their time modernizing and fostering an efficient economy after their 'successful' (according to Natalie) revolution instead of destroying their economy by murdering every intelligent, free-thinking or spiritual person in their entire country INCLUDING MANY PRINCIPLED COMMUNISTS (Cultural Revolution, Great Leap Forward; look them up), then Chinese families could afford Domino's pizza with a lava cake, too.  Thank you capitalism! Secondly, Natalie implies that socialist countries don't have advertising campaigns.  This is false.  They do have advertising campaigns, nowadays and in the past.  There is advertising in socialist countries nowadays because socialist countries are DESPERATELY TRYING TO INTEGRATE CAPITALISM INTO THEIR ECONOMIES!  Why?  Because capitalism enriches the lives of individuals and enhances societies.  So now let's ask, why didn't socialsim have advertising in the past?  Historically, there was only one type of advertising allowed.  Every Russian school had pictures of Stalin and every Chinese school had pictures of Chairman Mao in every classroom.  Every child was required to worship these people under threat of death or enslavement for life. Party banners were hung on every street corner so that while you were wallowing in your misery (too hungry and oppressed to experience malaise), you could see on every wall and street corner at the propaganda, I mean advertising, and remember who put you in your sorry situation.   Why didn't socialist countries advertise consumer products?  I would imagine it was because when you're struggling to obtain the basic necessities in life like food, clothing and freedom, the dictatorship ruling over you didn't want you to think about all the other great things you were missing out on as well.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Part 4: Chapter 4 alternate title - 'Victims' address their 'abusers' Natalie cites a study that shows that the majority of people under 30 do not support capitalism and that therefore the evil capitalist overlords who provide most of the goods, services and jobs in our society should fear for their lives and futures.  Yes, young people 'educated' in our high schools and universities have a hard time understanding economics.  Eckonommics is hared.  Unfortunately for socialists, after two decades, many of the young foolish failures she is speaking to will become wiser, middle-aged successes, primarily BECAUSE of capitalism.  When Americans succeed in life under the wonder that is capitalism, many of them stop thinking like victims and reject liberalism.  The hippies and far left anarchists of the 1970's are the voters who rejected Hilary and Bernie's leftist agenda and put Donald Trump in office, precise BECAUSE they got over their victim mentality and succeeded in this country.  Look at voting demographics.  Young foolish people support the left.  Older wiser people support the right.  But you don't need to be (or stay) foolish just because you are young.  You can get wiser right now and find success before you reach age 50.  Take responsibility for your life and your choices.  Don't be a victim forever.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Part 5: Chapter 5 alternate title - Message to the victims Natalie's alter ego says 'revolutions have worked in Russia and China'. Apparently the word 'worked' means something different to a socialist mind than it does to a normal human being.  If you consider the deaths of 94 million people to genocide and starvation over the last 100 years as an example of an idea that 'worked', then I don't really know what to say to you.  If you think the lack of individual freedoms and the inability to earn enough to support a family and the inability to have more than one child if you so choose are examples of ideas of things that 'worked', I don't know what to say to you.  Hisstorry is hared.  Natalie then encourages others to fester in their victimhood and to fight for state sponsored abortion, health care and education because this will lead us into our glorious future.  On demand abortion is already a 'right' in America, but I'm not sure what this has to do with capitalism.  Health care and education are abysmal precisely BECAUSE the government has stepped in to 'fix' them.  If government would get out of health care and education and allow free market capitalism to take over, we would see a dramatic increase in the quality and quantity of both of these commodities.  Do leftists really believe that the socialist ideal of Obamacare has improved the affordability or the access to health care?  Statisticks is hared.  If this is what passes for intellectualism on the far left, God help us.  Hopefully, despite ignorant videos like this, the youth of our nation will throw off the chains of victimhood and use our capitalist system to rise up and succeed in our country and then reject this pseudointellectual rubbish.  Conclusion:  Don't be stupid.  Don't be evil. Be successful (i.e. a capitalist).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Just gonna get my bias out of the way, I'm quite conservative.  Social inequality (hierarchy) has existed in human society since the invention of agriculture. This moment in history also is where the concept of private property starts. I grow all this food, more than I can eat myself, but that doesn't mean you get to piggy back off my labor. But if you give me something I want, maybe a nice ceramic bowl, I give you some of what I grow. That is the beginning of free trade and labor specialization.  I see government as the nonfarmers banding together and robbing the farmer of what he grew.   To attempt to stop this cycle I feel you have one of two options. Remove labor specialization and return our civilization back to a huntergatherer society where everyone did the same job and there was no social inequality or hierarchy or try to force us all to be perfectly equal through massive government tyranny.   There are social hierarchies and that's not going to change any time soon, but whereas in the past these social structures were enforced through divine right or rank of birth at least capitalism attempts to instead replace those hierarchies with ones created through meritocracy so that the position your in is largely the result of your own actions.  We traditional conservatives also recognize that materialism and consumerism is not a substitute for happiness or spiritual fulfillment. This is why we put our stock in the nuclear family, the local community, and our religion.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Electoral politics are generally useless without a strong social movement to put pressure on it so that the right the people want to defend are actually protected.  Considering how the western world transitionned from feudalism to capitalism (With the steps in between), I observe that the bourgeois class existed before the system that put them into power. They used the areas of economy that were not that much controled by the nobility (notably trade, and banking) to gain economical power. They then gradually gained influence in ideology during the Lumieres and finally took complete political power in the early XIXth century, the era being the one at the genesis of our modern bourgeois nation-state.   From this observation, I conclude that a 'Revolution' is a process rather than an event, a process that needs a myriad of different actions that intersect with each others. I would say that these actions are mainly divided into three categories.   ->Strategies of education ->Strategies of construction ->Strategies of destruction.  Strategies of education are lecture groups, propaganda, visibility protests (protests that need a great amount of people and that are mainly peaceful as to attract the public eye), experimentation of the other two categories and stuff like your videos.  Strategies of construction are all the actions that are done to establish new alternatives. Cooperatives, helping community groups and social services, eco-responsible initiatives etc.   Strategies of destruction are the ones that are aimed at state decisions. They include precisely selected targets like government or corporate office being utterly destroyed repeatedly (rather than just smashing anything that fall under our hands), cops being resisted by large groups of people vith non-lethal (and later, lethal according to the context) force, and sabotage of unpopular projects like pipelines.   Without education, construction remains the fact of marginal communes that breeds sectarism and are ignored by the masses and destruction is viewed as terrorism  Without construction, education remains merely theory nobody cares about an destruction does not support the people doing it and as militant forces tire, the state does not, counting on its seemingly unlimited ressources, or if we ever triumph anyways, let us in ruins without having any foundation to build upon. (I know Durruti talked about not being afraid of ruins, but we still must be organised to build afterwise, like the spanish were)  Without destruction, education is just ideology, and construction is either absorbed by the system, or destroyed by the competing forces of capitalism, like a pipeline would devastate the eco-system near a network of ecological communes or a certain type of cooperatives being attacked by new state regulation orchestrated by corporate greed and the need to bring people back in line.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The problem isn't with capitalism. Or in theory, any other economic system, though socialism has never worked without devolving into tyranny. The problem is people, plain and simple. Too many think if we can just implement a better or supposedly perfect government or economy, a proverbial better mouse trap, people will become better. Or at least have their worst demons curtailed.   Thousands of years of human history has proven nothing externally will make people behave better. Humans were made to game any and all systems. Most people are rebels at heart, and run counter to ANY system just to be stubborn. If we had Heaven, Utopia or Nirvana here and now, there would still be a significant number of folk that would fight it and attempt to overthrow it.  Too many prefer a Hell just so they can rule, rather than be content to serve one another in Heaven.  Only a change within each individual to live the Golden Rule, to be kind, compassionate, honest, etc. will make a better society and world. Anything else external always involves force, by the law, tax, fine, jail, and gun, to treat people as a herd to keep in check.  Even the framers of the Constitution knew and admitted that only a virtuous people would make our nation work, that freedom is fragile, becasue over time people can be free to choose to do the same stupid, selfish stuff and lead them back into misery.  I know I'll get the response, 'Well, what shall we do? Nothing?' My answer is focus on yourself being a better person first. Stop trying to be the manager of the world, and just manage yourself. Pushing for one ideology or politcal party as the 'cure' for our ills is often a distraction so we don't have to look at ourselves and deal with our own flaws.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I liked (though disagreed with) your video about Jordan Peterson, but this one is a disappointment.  You demonstrate zero understanding of economic theory, offer no solutions other than modest reforms.  Sure, raise taxes a bit and provide a better safety net like Scandinavia or Western Europe.  I'm agreeable to that, but all the shallow consumerism that you complain about will still be there.  And you still won't have much unless you apply yourself with some passion to contributing to society economically.  I don't need a video to tell me that only an idiot would pay $2000 for a pizza, or any meal for that matter, let alone eat gold.  But part of freedom is the freedom to be an idiot.  If you want to do stupid things, you can, and you'll get service with a smile, no questions asked.  While a large fraction of the population thinks that any man who wants to pass for a woman is crazy,  capitalism will happily provide all the services necessary for him to pull it off (by the way, you've done an excellent job -- you're sight to behold).  If you want to buy $10 worth of candy at your drugstore every day, and eat it all, nothing's stopping you.  Saying that capitalsim is evil because it won't prevent you from being an idiot is like saying cars are evil because they won't stop you from driving over a cliff.  You got a master's in philosophy, which demonstrates a high IQ, yet you were totally unprepared for the workforce and wound up driving an Uber.  You fit into a category of people who go to college, which instills in them a sense of entitlement, yet they make zero effort to acquire marketable skills while there, majoring in useless fields and thereby economically castrating themselves, and then spend the rest of their lives whining about how 'evil' capitalism is because it doesn't compensate them better.

"I liked 2 other videos by you (jordan peterson and the golden one), but I think you're completely wrong on this one. You are able to sit at your home, film your youtube videos, wear ostensibly glamorous outfits, request for people to support you on patreon - only on the fact that you live in the economic system that is capitalism. If you want to see what socialism looks like, and what happens when the government uses brute force to promote 'equality', I would recommend checking out north korea and venezuela as real life examples. Or read Ayn Rand's books, any of them. You are worth your value in what others can benefit from you; in this case interesting, unusually intellectual and funny youtube videos. If you weren't of value to your viewers, they would not support your patreon page. If we were to take your claim that fortune has to be redistributed because there are poor people elsewhere (why is anyone else should be held responsible for them instead of they themselves...?), than whatever money you've made, has to be given away to poorer people than you, so that you can now be equal. But are you? Are you equal (in value) to someone who is a homeless drug addict who lives on the street and can't get his shit together? Are you equal to bill gates, who has enabled millions of people worldwide an access to personal computers and has profitted billions from it?  If brute force is the only argument that you have to use against rich people, I would not want to see myself live (or succeed) in that world. A world where successful people are physically threatened, because there are poor people. This is not a zero sum game. About 200 years ago 90% of the population (according to yaron brooke, chairman of the objectivist foundation I think) was living off a dollar a day. Now that has changed dramatically. A lot of people live on much more than a dollar a day, quite comfortably, have more social and economic mobility, and that is THANKS to capitalism. Society would not do better if all the rich people were robbed off their well earned money and gave it away to poor people. They would waste it away as they did not know what to do with it in the first place, and have not earned it anyway. I would be really happy if you could make a video on objectivism/Ayn Rand's philosophy/Yaron Brooke. I doubt that any person is literally watching this channel with his own property, earned by their own money, can deny that capitalism serves humanity better than any other. Capitalism isn't the one spoonfeeding people with desires, desires have existed since the day man woke up and had wanted something. Anything. That's how the world has evolved, progressed. By people with a desire to live, and improve, and grow and gain. Capitalism is its facility. Everything is traded, and everything has value, or meaning.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Things are designed to be useful. It's a myth that things are designed with planned obsolescence in mind. Pick a product. Any product. A lot of extremely smart, hardworking and dedicated people have hired even more smart, industrious and dedicated people to research and develop the product to be better if an analogue exists, or they make a unique thing like an IPhone and then continue to improve it.  You don't throw away old IPhone because mean people made it bad, but because smart, hardworking and dedicated people have made iPhone 2 that made the original look bad.  Why are people making up things like an iPhone? Because some think that other people will want it more than the money they have saved by working themselves. What is work in today's society? Work is voluntary service of the community unread the leadership of a person brave, smart and insightful enough to save his money and invest it in his new product or service. What is this product or service? Something the leader perceives his wider community will value and want.  This leader becomes an entrepreneur that starts a new business. When the business develops big enough so that the original creator cannot handle the increased demand for his service or product, he hires more people. The entrepreneur pays people to do something the community wants.  When you get your pay, it is a certificate that you have served your fellow men. The more people value your skill, service or product, the more money people are freely willing to pay for it. The less people you serve and the less people value your contribution, the less money you get. There is no single person making up prices. The market, composed of the community of people, determine how much they are willing to pay. No one is forcing anyone to pay for anything. Capitalism is predicated on mutual satisfaction. You value iPhone more than you value money you have earned, and Apple values your money more than the iPhone they have sold you. Both parties are better off after the transaction.  You offer a service or a product and if the people are willing to pay for it, you'll become one of the few successful people, brave enough to try to start a business. Most others will either charge too much or offer a service or product that too few people value, and so they will go out of business. This is how in a direct sense, the community directly rewards or punishes different companies, goods or services. Prices aren't arbitrary. They are the exact lowest amount most people are willing to pay, and the exact least amount that still makes the seller better off too. In this way, and this way only- both the buyer and the seller are happy with their transaction.  It is only after the business is sought after enough, that more people can be hired to perform vital tasks in order to provide this good or service or to improve it.  Young people go to University so that they may develop higher skills so that entrepreneurs would be more likely to hire them. University training also increases students chances that they will be compensated higher for their contribution to society as well as makes very special few bold and daring individuals start their own company, service or product. No company started out big. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates started from a garage, while working and sleeping in their parent's basement. Only after a gargantuan amount of work and time invested have they developed into behemoths we know today.  People advocating for communism fail to see fragility of the early entrepreneur's problems and only wish to seize the company once an incredibly dedicated and clever person or people have brought it up from the ground. They confuse worker's contribution to the owners. The owner is the visionary. The person who has put blood and sweat into making the company grow. The worker enjoys stable pay regardless if the company is successful or not. They enjoy fruit regardless of the company's success. The owner enjoys success and profit if, and _only_ if he manages to serve big enough chunk of the community in such a way that they are more likely to re-use or recommend it to their friends and family.  If you think iPhone or any other good or service is far too expensive, feel free to start your own company that would charge a more fair price. Because this happens literally every day, it's very hard for anyone to charge too much or offer unfairly low wage for the workers. Any other business with a better plan, product or service will steal both the workers who will flock to work for higher wage, as well as customers who will want to purchase the better product.  This way, the market- made of the people in the community- together decide what they value. Those companies, goods and services flourish, while the others, go out of business and fail. It is only the most compassionate, fairest and least corrupt business prevail. Greed is the opposite of capitalism. Greedy people who charge more than something is worth go out of business fastest of all. It is only those who offer the most, for the least- that manage to prosper.  It is _only_ when the government, full of 'would be benevolent bureaucrats' try to fix something, make truly horrible. Think of the DMV. The government forces you, under threat of bodily harm and incarceration to both use their terrible service _and_ pay for it, regardless if you want it or not. You don't like thing X that government does? Only the government can compel you to pay for it. You don't like the iPhone? You can get Samsung or a skip the phones and get a lollipop instead. No one is forcing you to use _any_ free market product or service.  In other words, only Communism- where the government is responsible for everything, every product and service instantly becomes useless, gray, bland or more likely- nonexistent.

"great video, I just want to speculate about something quite off-topic. When you said 'the real surge and support for a white ethnic homeland' and showed a video of charlottesville on the screen, it really bothered me. The whole charlottesville 'protest' was about preserving history, and keeping up a statue. It has nothing to do with preserving or establishing a 'white ethno-state.' The man the statue is of (which is still up in charlottesville btw) Robert E. Lee, commander of the northern army of Virginia. People hate the statue because Lee was a commander for the confederacy; which automatically makes people assume he was pro-slavery.  But, this is wrong. Robert E Lee inherited slaves from his father, but then freed them because he did not believe it was right. At one point Lee was approached by the Union army to become a general for them, but Lee decided to fight for his brothers and his homeland instead, because he grew up in the south and knew there was nothing better than the hills and streams he knew and loved. Here in Virginia, Lee is a symbol of patriotism and freedom, not of slavery and hatred; and certainly not of an 'ethno-state.' I know many people who went to the torch march in charlottesville, and they are just regular educated college kids and parents who are tired of the far-left trying to bury any part of history they find offensive. Now, I am an emt and was there at the actual protest administering care to people, and let me tell you that everything AFTER the torch march was just a clusterfuck of paid protesters and bullshit. I don't think either side even knew what they were doing there.  What a cruel thing war is... to fill our hearts with hatred instead of love for our neighbors. - Robert E. Lee","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I am not a fan of socialism. I've thought about the issues with capitalism (and have read about how things work for a while) and find that the biggest issue we have is that there's a massive difference between large multi-national companies and everyone else (that is to say, mid-level sized corporations and everyone smaller in scale). Once you get massive enough that you're either a monopoly or part of an oligarchy, there's really only one game: perpetuating short term goals that completely ignore the long term health of a company because of the shareholders' interests.   This explains why the second largest pharmacy in the world (Rite Aid) was trying to sell itself to the largest one in the world, why T-Mobile's been trying to swallow Sprint or merge with AT&T. It also is one of the primary drivers of the 2008 market crash. If you reward short sighted aims, unchecked growth (Lewis Black's bit about a Starbucks literally across the street from a Starbucks comes to mind), and taking advantage of deregulation in order to commit crimes (aka: 2008 market crash), that's pretty much a recipe for fucking over people. Even with colleges, there's a massive bloat to the administrative costs, pushing costs up. If you want more profit, you monopolize and create more things to charge for.  To me, there's more of a cultural issue than one with the economic model. I see an over reliance on the pure math in economics with an absolute disdain for ethics in economics as the focal point, as it spills over into politics with the campaign contributions in order to get their way. And since the name of the game is money in politics, there's no way a large corporation can lose unless their candidates get out contributed by the opposition. But, if people think more ethically, then I don't think the emphasis on math will be so much of a problem, particularly when it comes to the term 'regulation'. I see minimal regulation as a means to just give a framework of what's not permissible. So long as you don't do that, you're good to go. But, that's not good enough to corporations because of the 'barriers to profit' that they bring.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"So according to this video: 1) The author has never been inside office buildings, but they sure are about to explain what goes on inside of them! 2) Capitalism makes sure that places people enjoy visiting are conveniently located all over the place 3) With capitalism, there's so much easily accessible food that you could accidentally put yourself into a food comma 4) Capitalism is horrible because it makes things we want 5) Comcast jacking up bills is capitalism's fault, even though the reason Comcast doesn't have capitalist competition is because it uses protectionist laws that were originally created by anti-industrialist socialists wanting to make telephones available to everyone, and making Bell Telephone into a controlled monopoly (internet in countries where there are no ISP regulations costs $15/m or less) 6) It's capitalism's fault that you have a shitty job, and not your fault that you spent your life playing video games instead of acquiring useful skills, expecting a good job to just be given to you. 7) Somehow capitalism prevents you from acquiring stake in Comcast by buying stocks 8) Having to actually make an effort at what you do is totally unfair, and you should be greatly rewarded for lack of achievement. 9) Shitty jobs are the only types of jobs available (please ignore all the fulfilling jobs that pay lots of money) 10) Capitalism doesn't allow you hate your life. 11) Jobs are something where you are controlled by an overlord, and quitting or changing jobs isn't allowed. Same for Uber, where you are forced to drive whether you want to or not. (incidentally Uber pays you for cleaning your car if someone messes it up) 12) People have no willpower, and follow whatever they are told, thus advertising. It's other people's fault when you can't control yourself. 13) It's capitalism's fault that the most government-regulated, protectionist, and socialist programs in the country - health care and education - have skyrocketing costs. 14) It's capitalism's fault that students make the decision to take on huge student loans without actually bothering to check whether they need those degrees. 15) It's capitalism's fault that homeless people don't use all the social programs and assistance we have in this country to give them the option to not be homeless 16) Capitalism provides humanity with places to visit, enough food to put us in a coma, and every kind of merchandise we may be interested in. Thus it does't serve humanity. 17) People who spend time creating videos (propaganda) about how evil the rich are and how they exploit everyone, noticed how everyone is now mad at the rich (I mean, congratulations on doing the thing you wanted to do?) 18) Recent polling done on a capitalist global network, by people using capitalist-created devices, while sitting in the comfort of their capitalist provided homes,  shows that people don't like capitalism... 19) What we are doing has been tried before and it doesn't end well. What that thing we're doing actually is, is not important enough to actually describe. 20) Capitalism and the rich apparently control militarized police, and would deploy them to protect themselves. Instead of just, like, picking up their shit and leaving the country like they did in places like Venezuela and every other socialist shithole, where the only one using militarized police are the democratically elected socialist leaders. 22) Capitalism needs the state to maintain its power. Ignore black markets that exist all over the world in spite of the state actually trying to stop them. 23) Revolution worked in Russia and China. 'Working' means killing about 100,000,000 people and dragging everyone else into extreme poverty 24) Solutions like learning valuable skills, or trying to start your own business and becoming a capitalist yourself are too hard. Best solution is to go to the polls and vote once every 2 years, where your vote for one of two possible douchebangs definitely makes a difference. 25) It's more rewarding to work hard enough reading long debunked and discredited populist propaganda to the point where you have a semi-PhD, than to spend that same time reading about how to actually contribute value to the world so you can earn a decent living.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Your whole argument is built on the premise that individuals have no free agency and cant make basic decisions and literally fall prey to every desire produced by ads and  never have a desire of their own. As if the market existed before we had desires and dictate or manufacture  our desires  and needs when its the opposite. Its our desires and needs that produced the markets required to meet them which is what capitalism does since its based on voluntary exchange. People have a need or desire, someone voluntarily takes a risk and makes it available and we voluntarily pay them for their product or service which we want or need. If we dont they go out of business....ike most businesses do. No one forces a desire or need upon you by its very nature. The fact ads exist literally shows how capitalism empowers the individual and doesnt strip them of power like u say. If companies were really that powerful why would they have to spend billions begging us and attempting to convince us to continue voluntarily buying their shit. Under communism the government mandates what u must do with guns and doesnt even have to bother trying to 'convince' you to voluntarily do anything, they just make you do it or kill, imprison, or torture you if you dont. The fact people have markets for trivial excess stuff is literally evidence of the success of capitalism and honestly proof of your own entitlement. We have most of our needs fulfilled to the point where we have the excess to entertain trivialities of life instead of having to focus on basic survival liek food and water. Even the issues u mentioned are dwarfed by the severe poverty of the non-capitalist countries as well as the severe poverty of literally most of humanity throughout history before capitalism existed which has lifted more out of poverty than any other system. Most Americans are dying of diseases from overeating thats literally how wealthy capitalism has made us. Medical and university debts are brought upon us by socialist policies that ruined the market, turns out when everyone is allowed to take out high risk loans for a university education and u give universities a blank check for government funding they tend to overcharge knowing the government is covering the bill, same with healthcare.

Capitalism incentivizes, you have to let people keep what they make. The problem which might present as capitalism has more to do with tax and election  reform, as well as grass roots movements to facilitate free speech and debate because north america is just about as divided as it could possibly be.   Also, NO it didn't WORK in Russia and China, you fucking nutbag. 40-100million dead between them right? 1 million would be too much. jeesus chrissssst man! and don't even start with the self-righteous indignation after you literally just made a video in which you stated that communist Russia AND communist China, together, WORKED, for allllllllll of the good people who suffered and died terrible, needless deaths, as a direct result of removing the individual incentive to work and cooperate.

"Thousands of people hold over 3 billion shares in Comcast and they are just one of 2800 corporations traded on the NYSE. If you have any type of retirement account chances are you do have some investment or stake in the profits of many of the corporations you deal with on the day to day. The CEO of Comcast will probably only be in that role for (maybe) a decade and works 100+ hours a week and spent a hole career getting to that point. He became a 'reptile' by being the best. People can always go out on their own and start their own company and be the lizard and chief.  As a person with a degree marketing (aka corporate product propaganda) I have to agree with the advertising chapter to a point. I think because of you tube and other consumer websites traditional advertising that you speak of is quite antiquated. Consumers are a lot more savvy than they used to be because of the internet. Also where can I buy Vitalimax? I'm asking for a friend.   I think your critique on the rich has some blind spots. The richest 1% aren't always in the 1% year after year. Long gone are the days of trust fund tycoons. Those that still exist are a fraction of the rich. Also if you look at house hold income(not individual income) people are increasingly moving into the upper middle class. Also increasingly people are getting off welfare getting Jobs and seeing increased wages.   Honestly I think what you are really criticizing is corporatism not capitalism. I think the answer is providing the 'youth' the opportunities  to start their own companies. The best way to do that is through decreasing the barriers to market entry. Many of these corporations you are railing against are lobbying politicians to build these barriers. That isn't capitalism, its corporate cronyism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The trouble is that all the politicians are bought by big money and the Republicans don't give a shit about that while the Democrats are actively working against candidates trying to run in their party without taking rich people's money. As long as the rich can buy off the politicians, we don't have the democratic options that we should and this might actually make either a violent revolution or a revolution in civil disobedience the only way to change the current system.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The reason why capitalism sucks is because we don't live in a free market capitalist society, but a bastardized corporatist, neocon/neoliberal version of capitalism. The reason why everything costs so much and the reason why jobs are becoming worse and are decreasing in numbers is because of increased regulation which drives up costs for businesses. The reason why so many jobs are going oversees is because in foreign countries, their governments aren't hostile to entrepreneurs. And as for why only giant corporations are doing well is because they are the only ones who can afford to pay for these regulations, effectively eliminating their competition (it explains why most giant corporations support more regulations and not fewer). In a free market capitalist society, we wouldn't have these problems because the Berlin walls that trap small business owners from having a chance against the massive corporations wouldn't exist. America would be much better, and people would be much richer, if we had maintained a free market system as well. In other words, you hate corporatism, not capitalism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"What you're complaining about isn't capitalism, it's greed and gluttony preying on envy. Its just as you said, big business creating needs so their products can fill those needs. The threshold for what someone wants and someone needs is very subjective.  Ice cream is a good example. Yes, it's food, and people need to eat, but ice cream can't sustain someone. It's value is purely that it tastes good, and people want to enjoy something that just tastes good sometimes at the expense of their health. Is that wrong? Should someone not provide ice cream to fill the need?  Capitalism is what allows someone who identifies people's desire to have ice cream to open up a store, provide a desired product or service and make a living for themselves (and others by providing jobs).  Evil big business becomes big because they provide a good or service that people want, and they do it well. You can complain all day long about Wal Mart (for example) but the fact is that people wouldn't shop there if Wal Mart didnt provide desirable poducts and services compared to the alternatives. If you hate Wal Mart then you're welcome to not give them your money or start a business that does it better than Wal Mart.   If you want to make the argument that big business can get bed with government to put their thumb in the scale against other businesses that aren't as predatory, then I'm 100% with you. Thing is, that's not capitalism, that's cronyism. And bigger government just empowers those businesses even more.  I love the format of the videos though. Well done!

"I mean, all your critiques are the normal critiques, but unfortunately the economy does serve humanity - it gives them what they desire to buy. So, let's say you retort that they created the desires, ok, but now you need to find some 'pure' desire which is 'really' their desire which I don't think you can. You can play the same game with thirst - I didn't decide to be thirsty, I am controlled by my body - and now we are in classical dualism. Fine. If we want to accept that duality, and can't find a way out as it is too powerful of a experience, then Kant is the only way out. With Kant's morality we create what we want to desire from our rationality then create a world such that we really do have that desire one day. The problem here is that the only world where this is possible is capitalism as all other worlds want to  have one overarching desire, some metanarrative, which you cannot escape. In such a totalizing situation you don't answer your original problem, you negate it. This is why communists and socialists will always just be parasitic Christians; they want the metanarrative, just their own.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"11:30 Most millionaires and billionaires are self-made. Wealth won't last for very long in a family if the future generations don't have the same work ethic, intellect, and ambition as the original family members who accumulated the wealth in the first place. The United States has regulated capitalism, so monopolies rarely form. There's always competition in this country, and nobody actually lives in poverty. Even homeless people find shelter and always get enough food. You're never going to get out of a bad financial situation if you always blame the rich, you have to realize that you're just as capable as anyone else is in this country to become a billionaire, and work hard to chase a better life from that point. Most rich people donate a good chunk of their profits to several charities and other non-profits on a regular basis.  Most rich parents won't even give any of their money to their offspring anyway, because they're greedy. They won't even pay for their kids' college expenses. If they weren't at least the slightest bit greedy, then they most likely wouldn't have acquired the money that they have. And the parents that pay for their kids' college education will almost always only do so if they major in something that they approve of. You also have to remember that there are so many people in this country who get useless degrees that will land them jobs that pay horribly, have either a job decline, no job growth, or very minimal job growth (in which case you won't find a job unless you had a really above-average GPA for whichever major). Those people later end up working jobs that don't even require a college degree with tons of college debt. Why should others pay for your poor decisions?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

On which we can totally agree, I'm sure, that Neoliberalism has caused the wealth disparity of the last 30 years.

The problem with indoctrinating socialist programmes into Governments now, is that so many governments right are a bloated, ill managed offices that I wouldn't trust with proper regulation and implementation of a socialist ideological world.

"One thing we can work towards is raising awareness of and support for Labor Rights. 'Union' is a dirty word in many states and communities, mainly because Republicans have successfully re-branded them in most people's minds as corrupt, unnecessary, and/or harmful to workers. But without collective bargaining, the exploitation of the working class will continue unchecked.  We need to be singing from the hills and mountaintops that Unions are needed to protect the rights of the American Worker. You aren't being paid enough to live because there's no Union to fight for a living wage. You got laid off or fired for no reason because you have no Union to fight for your right to work. You can't speak out against your shitty, abusive boss because you have no Union to back you up.

"See, the thing is: Communism offers a different method, but will net you the exact same results. If not ever so slightly worse. The problem isn't capitalism in itself. The problem is de facto aristocracy. Any system in which trade of resources occurs is a capitalist system. That includes most communist systems, unless you outright ban... Trade. And without trade, you cannot get what you want; only that which is allotted to you by an authority (which, make no mistake, will be that system's de facto aristocracy).  Whether the method of enslavement is necessary consumption of goods (rent, mortgage, education and Insurance hikes, as well as food price hikes and inflation that does not adjust with cost of living) without the ability to opt out or gather enough wealth to progress on the ladder (wage slavery, in short) or assigned labour, the effect is ultimately the same for the largest amount of people.  Capitalism, to the extend that it occurs today, is... Bad, but at least can get to choose what products we spend our meagre Leisure allowance on. Granted, that is mostly because money is smaller than vouchers. Under capitalism, you can ensure more individual freedoms and rights than under communism. Which is kind of a big deal for me.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"So, there is no question that there are some major issues in our capitalist society, but at the same time this is one of the few societies throughout human history that has brought so many people out of poverty and given them access to education and healthcare. We have the freedom to love who we wish and express ourselves in like manner as would make us happy.   One of the main issues with the views presented here is the lack (or at least seeming lack) of appreciation for what western society has built. Just destroying what we have is only going to bring about far more suffering than we currently have.   Communism has killed millions of people and the argument that it wasn't done right in Soviet Union/China...etc. therefore we must try again, is just making the ideology more important than the people that it should be serving. People must never be a means to and end. People are not expendable.

"I don't think anyone serious really measures well-being in terms of GDP.  Your claim that people are poor off doesn't offer something better.  It's like criticizing cars and telling people that horses work.  Communism has proven it's failures and mixed economies tend to have peoples that are largely decent to one another, which makes capitalism possible in the first place.  You can't run any society without decency and in a culturally diverse nation, many people view decency as an option rather than a personal obligation.  If you screw over a stranger, for instance, it's much different than screwing over your close family members.  Your family holds you accountable for your actions, when a stranger can only have legal or extralegal.  Anyway, back on point --  If you run a society 'from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs' you run into the problem of many people realizing they can just claim to be more needy or more oppressed than the others around them, and getting extra resources for that need.  Also, assuming the society doesn't have an underlying sense of honor, you could just claim your ability is lacking and not have to work as hard because of it.  At that point, the government would force people into work camps (assuming scarcity), ignoring both their abilities and needs, which is really no different than slavery.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Look.. It's just a tricky question. On one hand I believe that business owners no matter how rich they are should be entitled to all of (or at least most of) the money they bring in. Did they not fairly earn the money they made? I'm sure a lot of work goes into the creation and success of major companies, and it's only fair to let them keep what they rightfully earned. If an employer wants to offer me a job, they should be allowed to choose the wage, and if I don't like it then I can just turn it down same as any other mundane agreement. Maybe we should be looking at how our government constantly devalues the dollar and makes what paltry money you do bring in worth much less.  On the other hand a lot of people aren't able to avoid working for someone else as a lot of markets are almost completely cornered by big chain stores like Wal Mart. You can't successfully own as many businesses today as you could in the past so you're forced to work for someone else, and forced to take the wages they give you or starve. Although it's unfair to the business owners who (in most cases) worked hard for their money and deserve to keep at least most of it, they could definitely do without a lot of it and still live much better than %99 of people in the world. Taxing the wealthy can feed the hungry and provide services to people in need while not completely making them poor. However this can lead to outsourcing which does nothing but take jobs away.  They're both unfair to someone, and have clear benefits and drawbacks. You're either punishing the poor for not being good enough to compete, or you're punishing the rich for being too good at competing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I work in a state subsidized private industry, working at a group home for abused children. So many people leave because the job is difficult and they will be paid more as a wage worker at the call center. Abused children are being neglected and don't have stable theraputic counselors because we just can't be paid more and rent is too high in the area. Rent is so high because there was so much push to deregulate city commissions on housing. I'd do it too if I wasn't legitimately worried I'd be harassed at a non-progressive workplace like my boyfriend who does work at the private nursing company.

"Will you make a video that speculates on or clarifies the choice end goal of a transition out of the current economic order? To clarify, I do think the current state and level of capitalism has intense problems, but the Soviet model of revolution into permanent totalitarian government coinciding with the Chinese version of it seems to indicate that there is a fundamental flaw in Marxist/Leninist philosophy pertaining to what the revolution should look like and what the nature of the better model is. It seems as if the method of transition has a catch 22 effect that creates monstrous police states because redistribution of power necessitates that power first be collected in one place, but the people who are supposed to redistribute are corrupted by it. I think we should have a better idea of what we are doing because while the current state of affairs is bad, things can also get much worse.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think you're smart enough to know what you're saying is wrong. For example, you understand that a business owner is compensated more than their employees because they carry all the risk, and stand to lose a great deal if their business fails, something that ordinary employees do not have to deal with. Business owners also have resources tied up in capital, which employees are using to produce all the value you allege they should be entitled to, yet these employees would not be able to produce anything of similar value without that capital, or some other business owners capital, etc...etc... you mention none of this. You don't try to determine how much that risk should be rewarded, or how much the use of that capital is worth, to demonstrate that there is something unfair going on, you simply assume there is some injustice inherent in this situation without even making the argument. It's implicit in your rhetoric. I think you already know what you're saying is nonsense, but you pretend to believe for some reason. I really do wonder what your agenda is. Whatever it  is, what you're doing here is incredibly irresponsible and damaging to individuals and to society.

In fact some of the worst parts of the market often carry the states influence with it: Corporate ISPs, healthcare institutions, etc. I also think we should not be anti-progress technologically speaking. Low skill labor jobs are unfortunately a natural progression towards a post-scarcity society. The absence of soul here is that capitalism removes the humanity from it because for one, capitalism is a tool (much like an institution like government).

"Hey @contrapoints I can empathize with the points in this video but I don't agree with the narrative of 'oppressors' and 'oppressed'. Rather, it's something more like this -- the 'oppressors' are really just the people who are chosen based on their competence and willingness to take on responsibility. Example; I built a company in my 20's after working my ass off for 5+ years working 90 hour weeks while stretching my credit, health, and relationships to the max. After 5 years, for a very short time, I approached the top 10% of American earners with an income of around $100k/yr. I employed about 50 people during that time and worked hard to fulfill their payroll, PTO, health care, and HR related needs. And if I misstepped I'd hear about it pretty damn quick and pay the price. (I guess I was an evil capitalist lizard with slaves?) Anyway, rather than victimizing the workers and blaming the bosses, maybe pay respect and celebrate everyone's hard work and success? I like Jordan Peterson's solution -- bear as much responsibility and suffering as you can to give meaning to your life. If that was valued by both 'oppressors' and 'oppressed' I think this disparagement would vanish.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

As it seeks to oppress the other sex for it's own gains.  And just so we're straight, males putting females down was bad right?  So why the hell would the reverse be ok?  And very VERY few whites are wanting any sort of a white ethnostate.    I mean that in a strictly comparable way.  Take any other country with any other non white ethnic group who've been for at least a few generations primarily that ethnic group. Ask how many of them would prefer that it stay that same ethnic group.   And you will have a far FAR greater percentage than any whites in most major countries.  This is why even liberals are scratching their heads.  You are taking issues that we are currently the best in the world in.  And saying how terrible they are, with zero regard to how difficult it was it even get it to this point in the first place.  And THESE are your issues!  Not starvation, or mass deaths, wars, or drone killings, or even bloody climate change.   What's important we get less ads, and bathrooms that cater to 0.02% of the population.

"Here's the issue. You're not basing your points at the correct level of analysis. To critique the overall formula of Capitalism, you have to truly understand what its purpose is, and you do not define that whatsoever. With your shortsighted view of the 'material' that you note yourself very quickly in the video, you fail to critique past that level of analysis at all, you're completely mired in it. You fail to acknowledge 'needs' as a problem expounded outward from the individual and that those 'needs' are not capitalistically imposed by the supposed 'rules' of Capitalism. You can make the joke 'look what capitalism made me do' without realizing that its your capitalist ideal in yourself that allows you to 'do' in the first place. The one thing that capitalism does have, that many on the left seem to throw out the window, is that the mechanism by which it exists, also allows for a juxtaposed system to compete with the entire system itself. The value of economy is what is happening, NOT what people hoard. If I play by the 'open market rules' there are a lot of games that we can play, many of them not so good and extremely exploitative, but just because it allows one to do that, Its a bad idea to further hinder the individual the chance to convince people to play a new game that would be more beneficial for society in general. Capitalism allows the ideas of competent individuals to outshine those worse ideas of others. Legislating into law some sort of framework by which we hand off the competence of the individual to some large overarching structure only act as a hindrance to people who may have the possibility to fix the problems from within the individual and expanding outward into real world manifestation. The only reason you would feel as you do is because you feel your incompetence shining forward in the form of you not having the ability to fix it. You see the capitalist shilling and fail to see that you're just not good enough to beat it, so you need to legislatively impose against the most obvious problems you see. Keep calling yourself an intellectual with all your useless materialist degrees. You just fail to see the point.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

We don't have capitalism.  What we have is rich corporations buy politicians and then those politicians legislate their profits.  It's a big problem.  They squash new startup competition before it can be a threat (even if their model is better), and they fuck all of us up the ass because they don't actually have to make our lives measurably better anymore to get our money.  They pay politicians to let them keep sending jobs overseas, they pay politicians to raise our taxes while cutting their own, they pay politicians to spend our tax money on things that will benefit them, they pay politicians to steal land from people to put up a new building, they pay politicians to just straight up give them a cut of tax money.  It's bad.  It's fucked up.  All the problems you bring up are spot fucking on.  But this is not a free market.  The government serves corporations, instead of being an impartial referee.  This is a Corporate Oligarchy.  So please don't blame Capitalism (aka Free Markets) when that isn't what we have.  We have the opposite of that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"im an anarchist and i think you painted an unfair representation of anarchism, maybe not of anarchist, but of anarchism.    While i think anyone would agree we need some sort of plan, i felt it somewhat unfair how you portrayed the anarchist position. It's ironic that you made the joke about how anarchists ask condescendingly what one has read because the one you say you haven't is bakunin. I believe it was bakunin who was a part of the libertarian wing of the Internationale which did have what one could call a plan. not detailed of course thats ridiculous. But they did laid the ground work for what later inspired spanish anarchists to develop anarcho-syndicalism, which i would argue IS the plan.  what i mean to say is that, what the CNT, FAI, and IWW do is create a new world in the shell of the old. we argue that we should create things like workers councils, syndicates, call them what you will, and to have those new institutions that are being created serve as the backbone for the 'new world'. direct action is just the means. you don't need a politician to sign a piece of paper to get shit done, one could just go do it. there are people who organize soccer tournaments without the need of the state they just do it. why not do the same with every other institution of society? Why don't the people in the medical field run and operate the medical field as they see fit? i would argue they are the most qualified to do so.  another thing is when you said that the state is needed to protect capitalism. I completely agree. But i just want to make something clear. typically in my experience i find Marxists argue that the state is an instrument of class rule. So therefore why not create a state that protects the working class? While on the surface this makes sense i don't agree with the initial idea of the state being an instrument of class rule. While under capitalism it is quite clear the state serves their interests, it i think is inaccurate to say the state is an instrument of CLASS rule. Rather I argue the state is an instrument of minority rule, and has developed certain characteristics that help it do just that. centralized and hierarchical. it is for this reason anarchists reject the ML position of creating a 'workers state'. to us that is a contradiction. ultimately the party is going to be the new ruling elite, nothing really changed. so i think its important to know what exactly it is anarchists are arguing for and against.   one last thing. There are many objections marxists make of the anarchist position and i cant really go into detail and explain why i think the things I mentioned, however if you are curious i recommend the Anarchists FAQS, just google em. I think it's part H where they go over Marxists objections to anarchism. Also i recommend Bloodstained 100: years of Leninist counterrevolution.

"Need. What is need really. If we formed our societies based on 'objective' needs then we would have not need to progress further than the state of hunter-gatherers. Why did people need the spear when they could run down their pray? Why did they need the bow when they had the spear. Adverisement can be influential for sure, but to trace the origin of the subjectivity of need, to advertisement and capitalism is simply wrong. You should also define what do you mean by capitalism. Because if you define capitalism as a system of production through the accumulation of capital, then you are just describing every economic system, since like...forever. Let me make an example to prove my point. Lets assume we have an farming society, where than land is the means of production and the people work to sustain  themselves without the accumulation of any capital (aka spare food). Let us say now that this farming community wants to built a school. How to they do that? They can not stop working the land to built the school, not one of them, because they would starve. In order to built that school that need accumulate capital (food) to sustain the workers through the duration of the school's construction. By doing so, they have accumulated capital and have become in every sence of the word, capitlists, and work under a capitalist system.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Good video! You make the basic argument against capitalism very well, and the video is very fun, which is needed considering how many stuffy eggheads you can find talking about this stuff. I can't fully agree with the end of your video though. Tabby's lack of real direction is very common among the left, particularly anarchists, and I agree that it's a very serious problem, but there is a concrete revolutionary solution that doesn't rely on collaborating with the state. It's Protracted People's War (PPW), which is the only warfare strategy never to have been defeated militarily, and I believe the only way to destroy capitalism.  Its principles have been used in countless movements and wars since the success of the Communist Revolution in China, and regardless of how exactly you feel about Mao, the US military heavily studies his military theory, and in declassified intelligence documents, it's very clear that the US views it as a much larger threat to their dominance than anything else. The best thing is, its principles can only be used to the fullest by genuine revolutionaries, because it relies primarily on a large support base among the general population, which a capitalist military can never fully hold onto.  This style of warfare is exactly why the US invasion of Vietnam was repelled, and why the US failed to take over North Korea. Both of these countries are definitely capitalist, but they both successfully used elements of Mao's theory of PPW, and both states at the time enjoyed massive support from their people, with the invasion by western imperialism serving as a unifying force among the population. I believe that similarly, the US has never really won a war since WWII precisely because of the spread of the theory of People's War. Everywhere the US goes, the local peasants and workers are ready to pick up arms, and some group, whether revolutionary or reactionary, is there to lead them into battle.  There are many Maoist revolutionary groups in the world that are already putting the universal parts of Protracted People's War into practice, including quite a few in Europe and the US itself. From what the most organized of these groups say and what you can see in their videos and pictures, it seems they have been quite successful in this as well. There is no peasantry here, so PPW will look quite different in the west, but you only have to look at the recent and historical riots in the US to see how effective poor folks can be even when they're unorganized. Here too, people are ready to take up arms; it's just that the groups that have taken leadership so far have only lead them to the voting booths and to respectability politics, rather than to revolution. I believe that's changing though, as it was in the 60s and 70s with the Black Panthers and the Revolutionary Union/RCP-USA in their heydays.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

You are doing something much more than that, you're social media savvy has led you to do this out of necessity hasn't it?

I talked with my father today and apparently he's read two of David Icke's books! My father and I have almost nothing in common, so it's nice to see that I have sort of 'wedge in' to speaking with him about political ideas.  Something that confuses me is just what role commenters play in this scheme. This isn't just a comment is it?

"'Capitalism did X' - No. Capitalism is simply the ownership of private property, i.e you get to keep what you make, and transactions between people have to be voluntary, that is to say you have to consent to any kind of transactions, be that a purchase of some goods or services, or contractually transacting your own labour/ideas/skills for some renumeration/benefits (pay). Such a system efficiently creates products and services that people want, the fact that people want them has nothing to do with capitalism, that's down to whatever value system they subscribe to. Capitalism doesn't fetishize commodities, PEOPLE do, capitalism simply supplies those commodities  where there is demand for them, and makes sure that production of such commodities is done in a voluntary way. I.e you're not forced to work for anyone, you're not forced to hire anyone, it's a free market of people negotiating terms of contracts between them.  Here's a thought, if you don't like your job then leave. Jobs don't oppress people, and employees don't oppress people, you sign a contract voluntarily that dictate the terms of your employment, if you don't like the terms then don't sign. If you want a work force that bucks the trend, where workers don't have to complete with one another because raises and promotions don't have anything to do with the value added to the businesses then start your own competing business and implement those policies on the staff that you hire. What you'll soon find out is that no one with any prospects will work for you for long because their progress doesn't track with the value they add and they'll go to the competition leaving you unable to compete in the marketplace. The very business offering you a job to begin with, continues to exist because they promote the best and keep the businesses innovative and competitive by keeping their prices low and quality high.  We have advertising because people are stupid and buy products they're advertised rather than making rational choices based on quality/cost trade off. It's peoples behaviour that makes advertising a cost efficient enterprise, if people didn't respond to it or they simply blocked it (thanks adblock plus) then that problem would go away naturally. In fact the only way to make it go away otherwise is through the use of force, that is threaten people to not do it via some structure like the state/law. Again you have it backwards, advertising doesn't manufacture desire, people already have the desire for things, what advertising does it notify interested people that your product is available to fit that desire. If you're seeing adverts for things and accuse the advertising of making you buy something, you're just trying to relieve yourself of any actual responsibility for your own actions. Look at your own language 'create new needs', how is something a need if it first has to be created through manipulation?  This whole video from start to finish is about taking personal failings, and inability to control ones own actions and trying to lump the blame on an economic system that can only do these things if people voluntarily support such a system.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"So much misinformation and misunderstanding of the world at large. Crony capitalism is the problem ContraPoints, not Capitalism itself. The wealth gap you talk about increased under Obama's leftist policies. Because you do not understand capitalism, you and other 'progressives' are being used by the same reptile people you decry. Corporate governmental lobyists try to institute environmental, legal, and regulatory hurdles in the name of 'good things' to squeeze out competition, drive up prices, and then when they have a monopoly (like Comcast) they can do whatever they please - because you have no other choice.  When the government meddles in the free market they inadvertently cause massive bubbles - see the housing crash of 2008. This same thing is happening with Health Care and Tuition - because the government is guaranteeing payment, the companies charge more each year - and well above inflation.  On top of that, your answer to capitalist failings is Communism or Socialism - both of which have been tried and failed repeatedly. Communism is responsible for 94 million deaths. You state that you want the pursuit of individual happiness. You state you want people to not have to compete against each other. But your answer is to have a bureaucrat choose a shitty job for you, with no chance to move out of that role? Someone who does not know you at all?  Millennials need to get educated on capitalism and the free market, and our schools (yet another social program that is overpaying and under performing) fail to deliver on this. Occupy wall street was exciting to me because i thought 'Finally, people are seeing the true problem that is government-business collusion and crony capitalism in general. What a bust that turned out to be.  TLDR: Crony Capitalism is what the problem is. Your complaint about Comcast, your complaint that there are only carbon copy businesses, your complaint that school and health care are too expensive. Advocating communism to solve this problem will only make things worse - you will have even worse centralized power with no freedom to complain if you dislike, purges of people who do not agree with the states views, and no freedom of movement or speech.

"Here's four simple goals, a minimal programme of radical social change:   The first two are shorter term goals, like a starting basis, to be won by electoral politics in conjunction with labor struggles and community struggles, protests, direct action like blockades, sit-ins, occupations, and civil disobedience actions:  1. Actually implement basic human rights as proclaimed in the UDHR (both socio-economic ones like housing, healthcare, and jobs for all, strong social safety system; and politico-civil ones, including the stamping out discrimination and bigotry).  2. Have a robust social-democratic economic structure (strong regulations - environmental, health, safety, labor, etc, state interventions and investments, nationalization and municipalization of large-scale and middle-scale economy like infrastructure, healthcare, housing, education, finance, etc).  The latter two are the radical goals to be won at the same time by being a massive movement which forces structural change via super massive protests, a general strike, massive transportation blockades, and maybe massive occupations of public institutions and of large/important workplaces.  3. Restructure the state so that all public administration workers become genuine public servants (by instituting strong mechanism of public participation, a lot of referenda, meaningful participatory oversight over the executive and the judiciary, participatory budgeting, relatively small maximum wages for all public servants). 4. Make all private firms worker coops.  After achiving these four goals, then the fifth goal is to automatize production more and more, and along with doing that, to increasingly nationalize and municipalize firms, and reduce work hours, and keep doing that until we have fully automated communism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Shitty jobs can be made less shitty be unionizing. Insist on the right to Unionize, and make sure your union doesn't become another insidious bureaucracy. Also, insist on some government regulation of what an independent contractor is defined as. Advertising is simply propaganda. It's better to allow more people to propagandize their own interests than reserving that ability for the government. Advertising can be simple or complex.  College costs are rising in part because the government has guaranteed student loans, among other factors. A rich capitalist who abuses their workers is working against their own interests. They will eventually fail on their own, or suffer violent revolution as you said. Revolution starts with yourself. Improve your own situation directly by working honestly towards your goals. Do your problems with capitalism exist because you don't have useful skills? Get useful skills! Do your problems with capitalism exist because of legal loopholes?

"I really like your style, and I like many of your points, and I agree with many of your perceived problems, but I just cannot agree with any of your conclusions. For example, the idea that the point of advertisement is basically brainwashing people into buying things that they don't need is a little bit misleading. The main point of advertisement is to tell people about the existence of their product. Even if you have a very good business, let's say a very good and cheap carpentry business, if you do zero advertisement, even if people do need a carpenter and your business would be the best choice for their needs, if they don't know you even exist, they will not use your services. The main problem I have with your whole argument, is that you are basically just talking about big businesses as if they are not only the root of all the problems of society, but as if capitalism is just those big businesses, when it is not true. You can have your own business, do your own thing; but where I do agree with you is with this idea and lie that you will be rich, because for most people in society this just isn't true, and I can understand why people would be pissed of about it because they were 'lied to', but it isn't some kind of conspiracy, and you can blame the whole of society for it (Well, you can, but it makes no sense).  Capitalism in its purest form is nothing more than economic freedom. But many of the big business you were talking about as examples in your video, are business which have at some point (or even now) got some kind of special perk or help from some federal or local government. Basically these business are from crony sectors of the economy. So, if I were you, I would make the title of your video 'What's Wrong with Crony Capitalism' instead.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I never get when people talk about how awful capitalism is because of advertising. What do you plan to replace it with? The welfare state? Isn't that just blatant physical coercion? You can't exactly opt out of taxes, and that seems a lot worse than advertising, since you can definitely just turn your television off, or like not buy shit you don't actually want. Whenever I see left wing people talk about capitalism it seems like they blame it for anything that they don't like. It probably helps that the definition of capitalism is often so vague that it can be applied to Switzerland, a wartime economy, the Swedish economic system, or really any system with wage labor. In the beginning of this video you seem to imply that the war on terror is a product of the capitalist system. How? What about the increase in the scope and size of government and the massive collateral damage that always comes with war is consistent with the principle of respect for the individual and their right of self ownership. I'm sure some rich people became richer as a result of that war, but to show that it is the result of capitalism you have to show that it is a natural outgrowth of these principles (unless you have another definition of capitalism to offer). Also generation z is both more socially and fiscally conservative than millennials, so I wouldn't bet on revolution any time soon.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"While I agree with many of the points made in this video, can we actually say that capitalism necessitates the state? While it seems like it has done so in the past, the rise of colossal conglomerates with the resources brought about by automation and technology at large will readily contest this apparent norm. What will happen when Amazon or Google have access to technologically-derived psychological manipulation, repressive power purely based in automated assets and the resources to sustain themselves without the need of the worker? I believe it would be naive to put our hope of a better future in the hands of social-democrats. Additionally, you seem to believe that the interests of the capitalists will not be protected by the police state if these are hindered through current political channels, but as we have seen before, as soon as the filthy reptiles' interests begin to be foiled, they will not hesitate to create another War-on-Drugs-like repressive reform to squash the movement. Also, how would you suggest we combat the rising Neo State Capitalism of China? There are no avenues for political reform of the kind you suggest there and their repressive apparatus is already close to unsurmountable and it may become impervious through the technologies they are rapidly developing (A.I!!!!!), rendering our future into a genuine cyberpunk dystopia like Elysium, one Matt Damon will not be able to spare us from.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You know jack shit about capitalism and why it's effective. On top of that you have no idea how to improve it.  Under capitalism people are strongly encouraged to GIVE more in order GET more. If you are an excellent employee who is the cornerstone of your company (like a good CEO) then you make TONS of money. If you build a business which delivers huge amounts of social value at a low cost then you can become a billionaire. Under socialism people are not motivated to give more to get more, as a result every single socialist/communist country is a poverty stricken hellhole. That's because in socialism nobody CARES about anything. Everybody just pretends that they care, especially the planners from The Party.  Good life is all about what you GIVE, not about what you TAKE. In capitalism when you give a lot (in a smart way) then you also take a lot.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"whoa, hold on, forgive this second comment. 'capitalism needs the state to maintain its power' this sentence is flawed and i'll explain why. capitalism is the natural result of free trade. societies that support the idea of hierarchical business, lead to CEO heads being stupid rich. in anarcho-capitalism, there would be no state head to bribe, so companies would have to deal with private arbitrators and private courts.   you could still argue they could buy off those people, which is a fair shot at Ancapistan as not being much better than things are now in some ways. but at the same time, big government has the power to legitimize the actions of a company on mass scale, whereas if you had a bunch of people who had the same guns as the military does, and a company decides to do shitty stuff, like pollute water, whip workers, whatever they do, well then the people can make a conscious effort to negotiate, guns in hand, to tell those CEOs to fuck off.   the problem isn't as much as it is capitalism, but the chaotic results that capitalism provides. if i say 'i want to trade you this, for that' i do not want a government telling me i can't sell to you, or worry about being taxed on trades. it's not so much that i am in full support of capitalism, as i am in full support in trading what i want, to who i want, without a state fucking me in the ass.   as to my point, capitalism doesn't need a state to maintain its power because it doesn't have power, capitalism is not a person, it is the result of people of both having the freedom to trade what and with who they want, and people agreeing to the existence hierarchical big businesses.   what is the solution to this? really depends on a lot honestly. in anarcho-syndicalism, everyone in a company would get paid roughly the same, have the same amount of say as a CEO would, and maybe some pay difference based on meritocracy and/or overly effort put in, but if society supported companies more like this, perhaps that would be more up your alley?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

That the quality of your work or what you do to better the lives of those around you is all meaningless, because it can't get you an A.

"With the exception of the bit about the plight of the homeless people, I don't feel you really address what's problematic about capitalism specifically. You more just describe ennui and subjective impressions of consumerism as bad. A lot of people like consumerism. The marketing can be entertaining; the food can be delicious; collecting physical items that people feel fits their personalities can be psychologically gratifying; the bare walls of the North Korean station can represent human suffering where no one creates wealth and no one has the ability to get things they want, if you choose to look at it that way. I think maybe because you personally are sick of the status quo and surround yourself with people who feel the same way, you've lost sight of what makes it attractive at all and see it as a foregone conclusion that the world around you is awful and that this sentiment can easily be communicated and subsequently propagated when realization is made. Many people can understand but not agree.  This ennui-based disdain of capitalism is dismissable by people who really care about capitalism because it doesn't address the nature of violence at the heart of the matter. The socialist view is that there is a problematic hierarchy inherent to capitalism where those at the top exploit those at the bottom, who are at threat of harm from natural forces such as sickness and hunger, and that the artificiality of the capitalist system renders this a form of violence conducted by the powerful against the impoverished, so the idea of violence to bring about the end of the artificial system is logically ethical. The capitalist view is that the natural forces to which people in poverty are subjected have no people to blame for them, representing a natural neutral state, and that wealth created by business is an entirely separate artificial construct that betters humanity. Without having an understanding of the socialist conception of the violence committed by people who maintain capitalism, your argument seems bizarrely violent, jumping from subjective emotion-based disdain for consumerism to advocating violent revolution or the slightly less direct violent revolution of voting into power people who will command the cops to enact violence against those who will not go along with having their wealth--self-made in the artificial construct of capitalism that betters humanity--stolen to better people who suffer only from natural forces and not anything for which anyone is to blame. You won't convince people truly invested in capitalism without understanding how they think and focusing on the issue they care about: the perception of the installation of socialism as more violent than the maitenance of capitalism. Otherwise, you're just preaching to the choir. If you aren't planning already to address it in a future part, you might want to think about it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

OH MY G-D! GETTING A NEW KITCHEN SET! THE HORROR!  3) OMG! It's ALMOST as if Richard Spencer and the Alt-Right ...

I'm mean, you care so much about the poor, it must be at least half of everything you make, right? Or maybe you spend time at shelters?

"Shitty Jobs:  Shitty Jobs exist to tackle problems other people might have. You suffer AND profit from it. If your Internet fails at 2 a.m. on a Saturday because of a small issue on the ISP side that can be fixed by them simple pressing a button to reset your line, do you want the solution with no shitty jobs for everyone? Or would you prefer the solution of everyone does some sort of shitty job so when we are outside of it things will work for everyone.  CEO: The CEO gets money according to what the owners of the company think he should earn, good CEOs are a rarity, just like good athletes in any sport for example and compared to athletes CEOs at least most of the time try to create jobs by expanding a business.  Mandatory Fun: Like the mandatory diversity classes they force upon everyone that make me resent the progressives more and more every time I hear one open his mouth.   Advertising: North Korea is full of it - Pictures and statues of their leaders, even worse if you treat them like we treat advertising in the west you'll be either killed or send into a working to death camp to die slowly. Also, we have the choice not to buy in to advertising, North Korean do not.  Health care, University, Hunger:  I'm a European social democrat at heart, I think society should provide for basic needs if someone can't afford it themselves, this includes education up to university. But Social Democracy is not against capitalism, it uses its drive to create wealth for the good of the people. Unlike socialism, social democrats don't believe they are better at leading a business than the people who invested their life into it.  The Revolution:  You need a strong social democratic push in the US. The problem with your 'Left' is it fell in Identitarian trap, the one fascists use to define problems blaming scapegoats on your personal failings. Do not think, even for one moment, that your identity politics left, will crush the identity politics right and all will be well. They will fight back until the streets are paved with blood like in Weimar Germany.  Instead of the outcome we have seen so often when two extremes fight each other and we end with either fascism or whatever happened to the socialist idea in Russia and China (which will be always what Socialist revolutions will end up looking like - read Orwell's 'Animal Farm') - I propose the so called 'Rhine capitalism', a Social Market economy: URL instead.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It saddens me that people have such a poor grasp of economics that they turn against capitalism. Capitalism has many problems its by no means a perfect system, it is however the far best functioning system we have ever tried. There are reasons why the richest countries in the world are capitalistic, there are reasons why all succesful capitalistic countries are based around freedom.  Capitalism is what is paying for your schools, for your welfare that is what capitalism is paying for through taxes because capitalism doesnt naturally grow these areas well. If you are against capitalism tell me any other system that is going to work.  Capitalism basically uses our wish to have more to reinvest our own profits to produce even more jobs, you work hard and you get promoted and you start earning more money then you can spend but the system works so that you want to spend that money on something, lets say a capital investment in a new business in return if it works out you make some money and if it doesnt you lose it all. This creates jobs all the time because a company uses their profits the same way, they give some money to their investors and share holders, they pay for the expertise of their personell, they pay for everything and with whats left they can try to expand or give out bonuses.  Are you against bonuses? Well why is anyone, because people dont understand that its a reward to the people that has increased the profits of the company, why would anyone work their ass off for a year on the slim chance that they make it even better if they cant get a reward for it if they are succesful. We need to incentivise taking economic risks for the companies so they want to reinvest their money on the market so more jobs are created.  All companies seek to be more effective naturally so over time they will produce more with less workers, this creates unemployment, so we need another system so they will reinvest their new profits, that is what capitalism does. It creates more jobs, which will reduce unemployment which in turn increases wages naturally because of supply and demand. As the supply of able bodied people lowers and the demand of them goes up wages will follow because they need to incentivise people to work for them.  If you disagree please explain why and i will gladly listen i am just as interested as you are at making the world a better place for everyone. Capitalism has many problems without a doubt we simply have no better system.  Socialism doesnt work, im a Swede and i can tell you how it fails. It cant create jobs, Sweden has not started any succesful business in almost 40 years now, the last was Ikea and now if you start a company you just have to tax all profits away so almost no new companies are started, innovation is only present in academia and science but that doesnt create any jobs its just a novel idea which no one will be interested to take advantage of because why risk your money and work your ass off just to tax all profits away, better to stay at your medium wage job.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There are two major things that need to occur.   1) the stop of globalization and the majority of corporations.  This primarily needs to be done by citizens embracing local business after realizing what damage companies like Amazon are doing and how they not only will come to solidify poverty, but how that poverty makes it increasingly hard to reignite local industry.    2) We need a hard swing to the left politically, but this can't be done as 'Communism' as we need to get people a little more warmed up before talking about that directly.    This is going to require a radical means of messaging and some tough choices in leftist movements.  Currently, there is a shit ton of alienating being done from leftist movements.  Say one wrong word or do one wrong thing and it's like you are the worst person ever.   That shit has to stop, and that means we call out people for being elitist assholes. This also means talking to people that might sound racist, but perhaps don't understand why.  That means decrypting right wing media and exposing people like Ben Shapiro for what they are and how workers movements have made real changes.  And while that may be propping up Capitalism, it re-exposes people to left leaning politics and will soften them up to start having honest discussions about Communism.    Although I will say, yes, with Communism in America it needs to be well thought out.  A change through outright revolution could occur, but it would be extremely violent and most likely end up breaking up the union anyways.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Regarding shitty jobs. Is it necessary for capitalism? It's more of a 'path of less resistance' in capitalism, which ends up in hierarchical big organizational structures. In IT there are various private 'capitalistic' companies and organizations with better structures where there is less hierarchy, more autonomy, and freedom to allow each employee to have a say in their work (be it what they need to do, how they need to do it, etc). There's also a shift towards making the job less shitty, not ony so the employee actually performs the job better, but so the employee may find ways to make the work even better (not just perform the same routine, but find a more efficient or optimal way, find new technology or proceses that end up improving the company), but also to make it ethical and rewarding (in a humanitarian sense, but also thinking long-term, making that workplace attractive, having good PR, etc). It works, it is still capitalistic but no 'shitty job' or 'alienation of your work'. Granted, so far I'm only seeing it applied in IT, where the context is very specific. The problems being solved, products being created, work being done, etc, is complex and having workers not feel shitty directly improves those products (unlike a factory worker, where the worker feeling shitty or not has much less impact on the final product). There is also a shitload of demand so the companies need incentives to keep high-skilled employees and attract talent. But surely it can be applied in different ways in different industries.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"How did you get Rob Walker involved?  Comcast increasing your bill just because they can?  Yet somehow the Free and Open Internet(tm) will make this so much better when monopoly ISPs are even more Free and Open to fuck their customers over, because you'll have so much choice in what websites you'll have to pay to access.  Bring on a State built network with legal obligations to allow Local Loop Unbundling - it's (almost) what we have in the UK, and no ISP would dare put bills up for no reason, not when they're competing with every other ISP in the country.    Oh, you are bring back horrible memories of working at Orange customer service (now known as EE customer services) and at an agency working for Sky customer services which was even worse than Orange.    Though tech support for HP wasn't that bad, I actually enjoyed it, until shop gimps from Comet called and ganed the system so they could replace perfectly functional laptops with other perfectly functional laptops that weould exhibit the same fault at the customer's home because the fault was never with the laptop in the first place.  Fuck Comet, I'm glad they went out of business.  Well advertising was known as propaganda as does use thew techniques pioneered by... the *NAZIS* (dun-dun-DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNN!!!!)  You could go less further back than the French Revolution, look at the collapse of Margeret Thatcher and the failed promise of New Labour.    But the rich have always managed to steer the rage of the young and the downtrodden to their own ends, mostly through fascism and the far-right.  Largely because the fascists don't ask you to read loads of books.

"If you want to reap the full benefits of your labour in a capitalist society, you are totally free to self-employ & be your own business. Not all employers are MegaCorp CEO lizard people.  Most people don't pick this route. There's no guarantee you'll find clients & get paid *at all*, you're going to spend a lot of your time doing things other than what you're good at, you probably are going to need to invest some startup funds and are going to take some time before you so much as break even, and for all you know there's a new invention coming out next year that will make what you're selling completely obsolete. So this either requires you start with a decent amount of capital, or have someone who does and is willing to take a chance on you (which gets easier the better your idea is). But if you want to get the full value of your services, this is a risk you have to take on, because nothing obligates people to buy your shitty homeopathic vitamin supplement. (High risk, high reward.)  When you choose to work for someone, you shift all of that burden onto them. Instead, you now get a static, consistent, reliable, and comparatively immediate payout. Sure, you may get fired on short notice, but you're legally entitled to compensation for every hour you have spent on the factory floor. (Low risk, low reward.)  There's a bunch of intermediate possibilities, some good, some bad. Giving employees shares in the company, working for commission/tips, pyramid schemes, performance based raises & promotion, partnerships, independent contracting, hiring an agent to find contracts for you, etc. All of them are different arrangements people have independently come up with to try and find an agreeable arrangement in which all parties involved in the transaction are happy enough with to consent to the exchange.  Regardless of what method you think is best, no one else is bound to your idea of how it should be done. Don't like the price? Shop somewhere else. No one is required to do business with you if your terms are unreasonable to them. They might be wrong about what's reasonable, but so might you. No one is able to be an expert in everything, but the people closest to the most relevant aspects of the industry will know the most (because it's in their self interest to learn) and they will be able to set their own terms. Which encourages most people towards the most reasonable terms for everyone by having selfish interests line up as close as possible with serving the public good.  The socialist/marxist alternative, is to simply violate the consent portion of the exchange. Either forcing someone to provide the service (slavery) or forcing someone to pay for the service (theft). Generally this is something unpalatable to most people, but it manages to catch on as popular by simply targeting an unsympathetic minority (the rich) to fuck over with reckless abandon. Personally I'm not particularly ok with establishing this precedent (even if these people are insufferable), because it establishes that it is *OK* for the majority to just fuck over someone they don't like.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Criticizing is all fine and good but if you want to change a system it would be better to come up with a better alternative.  You say capitalism has been tried before and it failed... well so have socialism and all other previous systems.   As far as the rich are concerned - they need not fear us, the common people, nearly as much as they once did. Soon enough AI will take over the work that needs doing and as soon as there is no need for peasants to produce wealth... well just see what happens in oil rich countries where all the wealth comes out of the ground and the rich need no educated people to produce it or in African countries where the leaders make money by having diamonds, gold etc. dug up.   As soon as we, the peasants, become obsolete as a wealth producing machine for the rich we will be lucky to be allowed to live in a slum all around uptown (where the rich live opulent lives of luxury and decadence protected by the army). Indeed we should be grateful if we are not simply killed much like we kill pests who bother us just a little too much. After all engineering a virus to kill us off if we become too bothersome would not be too difficult for the rich.  P.S. Thank you for the videos you make.

"I favor syndicalism. It already exists in various forms (worker owned businesses). It does what socialism claims to do which is put the means of production back in the hands of workers. Whereas socialism ends up putting it in the hands of government bureaucrats with mixed results. Not to be confused with social democracy which means and expanded social safety net and services, which I also favor to some degree.                                    Syndicalism already has a proven track record and the word does not have the baggage that socialism does. It is something that we can all support on a small scale now (by supporting or forming these kinds of businesses), but also on a larger scale in the near future (by lobbying for regulations that favor these kind of businesses), and as a complete shift (once this has become more popular making it the law of the land in place of businesses owned by people who don't work in them).

"Out of all options capitalism is the beast, because it allows you to live the way you want. Communism forces you to live certain way. Problem with capitalism today is that it is not capitalism, its socialism in disguise. You dont own anything that matters.. You loan it out from government. You buy land and a house, correction you loan it and have to pay for government for simply owning (loaning) it.  Biggest problem i see is that people are brainwashed into chasing things they dont need, because things = status, that and nihilism of modern west creates people without purpose and goals.  As for economy serving people, i think the problem is the illusion of GDP, according to GDP a divorced couple with 2 kids(both adults work) is doing better than married couple with 1 parent full time and other part time working, because they own 2 houses, 2 cars, 2 of everything.  Also broken families creates whole industries that raise GDP,(huge divorce lawyers companies, extra judges, clerks all that jazz) That is good for economy but bad for the people.  @edit: The key things is money is fake, its is only paper, and if you look at productivity vs average hourly compensation and average hourly wage, it use to be pretty close together until societies went off the gold standard... Now federal reserve just prints more and more money... Also if you took whole paycheck of a CEO of Walmart, and split it among employees they would get like 4 bucks each...

This isn't a critique of capitalism in general, it's a critique on how America largely fucked up by letting things go this far with student loans, rising underemployment, and disenfranchisement through the means of 'shitty jobs'. You do nothing to disprove the market economy and nothing to refute capitalism as a better system than communism/fascism/whatever-ism. I'm sorry but if you're basing your analysis of a global economic system on national issues in the US, you're missing a lot. What about the vast reduction in the poverty on the global level since the industrial revolution? Or largely the invention of the IMF, World Bank, GATT (later WTO), regulatory agencies, normalized political intervention in the economy to protect the consumer or curb negative externalities, and the social safety net. I normally enjoy your videos ContraPoints, but I feel that this is intellectually dishonest at best, go ahead, prove to us that even in capitalist economies all around the world leave people worse off than they would have been under a different system. There are valid critiques of capitalism to be made, and I'll agree to most of your points, but that's because they're focused on one of the most unequal, corrupt, materialistic, countries in the world. I'm not sure that someone from Asia, or Africa, or South America, or Europe would agree that capitalism is the source of their woes, if anything they may praise the fact that the market economy and everything that goes with it has improved their quality of life and not deteriorated it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"90% of this is incredibly wrong, but whatever The increase in market based mass production has dramatically increased living standards worldwide, even in countries with very little economic freedom. The countries that are still struggling are the ones with little economic freedom and rule of law. Taking over the means of production won't increase living standards for workers or allow them to work less hours or work in better conditions, surplus value theory makes no sense. It's not like there's a massive pile of consumer goods the capitalists are hoarding or something. The working class consumes 99% of all consumer goods, taking over the means of production won't magically change this.  marxism is a cancer that keeps coming back  It's funny but sad that these people with poor reasoning skills are completely wasting their lives  just have to use more chemo I guess","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Men are clearly disadvantaged on a range of metrics from violent deaths to prison populations to subconscious likeability. Plus feminism tends to demonize men. (I think it's misleading of you to keep referring to 'white men', because on the aforementioned metrics men are analogous to blacks not whites.)  Men only appear powerful because men are, in a sense, power objects - ie. men are objectified as protectors and providers.

North Korea? communist China?   i'm a radical idealist, hoping for an end of centralized systems, or at least a great downgrading. instead of unifying all under a huge governmental state, why not go down to the community level? at least until we figure out how to make replicators or some way to become post-scarcity.   whichever way we go, government or not, i at least want as much freedom as i possibly can without it being a problem. i want to own whatever gun i want, do whatever drug i want, and within consent, have love with whoever i want. i want to end, or at least greatly reduce taxation, and replace government subsidization and 'safety net' programs with a societal culture of charity and encouraged fundraising.   i am a Voluntaryist. i have no clear endgame, i will support whatever ends up working out, but i aim somewhere between Minarchism, Anarcho-Capitalism, Mutualism, or Anarcho-Syndicalism. i'm also open to the idea of a Resource Based Economy as explained by the Venus Project.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I try and use the best labels I can to guide my best understanding as to how we can make the world a better place. And a lot of that world looks very capitalistic. By that, I mean, there are a lot of ways in which my ideal would still has a lot of the same mechanisms in place. I still think that finance is an important thing, and that under the ideal society, as I can imagine it, the stocks and money that act as abstractions for the goods and services and the means of production of either are simply more spread around. We can probably get rid of certain speculative instruments that do nothing to help drive the creation of wealth. Advertising should be nearly done away with, or, at least, massively reformed in order to emphasize appreciation rather than desire. Unsustainable desire should be well managed rather than encouraged. We should still have money, just that the money should be better distributed, with a possible system of basic needs guarantee which will ensure that a certain amount of shelter and nutrition and clothing, and access to social society is free upon purchase, if such a system is both possible and not superfluous. And all of this is just me laying out what I can actually understand as possible. I would not mind if we go 'further' or if there are better alternatives to these and other ideas, but I cannot advocate for them unless I can personally understand how they would be functionally possible. Some of the ideas I put forward might be practically impossible to realize, but because I can both theoretically realize them happening, and can also realistically immagine them happening with an achievable level of solidarity, I don't see the practical impossibility. But the second step after recognizing there is a problem is to elucidate solutions and why they are feasible, and why the seemingly impossible is actually possible with enough tenacity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think one of the big problems is that we shouldn't be aiming for 'capitalism.' We've let dogshit marxists control the intellectual narrative for too long. Capitalism is a pejorative, at least made popular by (if not created by) Karl Marx.  The issue is that real thinkers like Adam Smith didn't actually aim to rhetorically advance their values. Adam Smith laid out a series of arguments about general practices that are pretty good ideas and tended to increase wealth in nations. That's not to say that Smith didn't have a political agenda, but it is to say that he didn't really create polarizing categories in Wealth of Nations. Like, just look at the language that Marx uses: 'a spectre is haunting Europe. . .' There's so much more passionate energy in Marx than there is in Smith.  I think the problem is that even if you're not a Marxist, you still see the world through a marxist lens now.  If we're going to overcome capitalism, we're going to have to overcome marxism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You need concentration of surplus and incentive for investment  to create a instrument of expansion for a civilization. Capitalism is so far the best system in this regard. Sadly it has become institutionalized and the concentrations of surplus (corporations and megarich people) no longer invest as much(with exceptions found in people like Elon Musk) - but instead spend the money on nonproductive luxuries and extravagances, but most harmfully security, lobbying and general perpetuation of their position of power.  Socialist turn to the state, as it indeed is a concentration of surplus, but do not realize that it is even more institutionalized than the capitalist structure (or rather, the organisations than live in the capitalist structure) - using nearly the entirety of the collected surplus not for investment, but to secure and perpetuate the status quo with huge military, policiary and most of all welfare budgets. When was last time we had the government actually investing in the country? When was the last 'New Deal'? The infrastructure is in disrepair, but still so much money is spent on unproductive enteprises (walls are a sign of decline, they do not create surplus, only protect existing surplus). Truly, capitalism is not as far gone, as we still have concentrations of surplus within the structure that invest in the projects that increase capital rather than tear on it, as can be seen with Elon Musk among others. But the thing many notice now is how many rich and powerfull actually do not try to increase the output of the system, only living off of the output like parasites. What we are aproaching is the status quo. Then comes the decline. Maybe we will get a new instrument of expansion? Maybe capitalism will be reformed.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Blaming capitalism for extreme consumerism (and its malaise) is sort of like blaming modern farming techniques for obesity.  I mean, it's true in the sense that they allow consumerism and obesity-- but those are consequences of its success in satisfying people's desires.  What needs the social pushback are consumerism and obesity themselves, because help is readily available there too and the current alternatives to free markets and modern farming have much worse consequences for human well-being.  Is it really so difficult to see through marketing?  That's something that even young children learn to do with some ease.  Who are you going to prevent from offering people delicious tacos in exchange for goods and services, ContraPoints?  If you don't have any stake in the profits of your employer, then your employer wouldn't have hired you.  There is no charity here-- you work for them because you value the money they pay more than that time and labor; they pay you a certain amount because they value your time and labor more than the amount they pay.  Both sides try to get the best they can, and if the discrepancy is too large because of the power difference, you have a right to organize and pursue collective bargaining during negotiation-- or acquire more skills that allow you to be more individually competitive.  Marx was wrong about labor having objective value, its value is subjective just like anything else-- this is the contemporary economic view, and has been for a long time.   It's difficult to experience companionship with other people in your situation?  Sorry, but that's complete horseshit.  Have you ever held an actual job?  Or watched workers socialize at a job?

"I think criticism of capitalism is warranted, but my question is - what would you replace it with?

"It's a bit disingenuous to imply that radicals have no plans, and that if there isn't a clear cut plan then you should dismiss any kind of direct action by radicals in favour of parliamentary reform. Radicals talk often about expropriation of private property, or getting communities to organise themselves in a less capitalist manner (one completely free of capitalism would be nigh impossible without a revolution alongside it since, you know, basically the whole world is capitalist), to give some examples of action more specific than 'smash' or 'revolution'.   Also, changing things through the state is wholly ineffective since the state is controlled by political parties, which are themselves controlled almost entirely by people in the capitalist class. Even Bernie Sanders, popular as he was, would never have had any chance at all if he actually actively argued against capitalism in any meaningful way since he's really a social democrat at heart. He never said that value forms or wage labour should be abolished, or that private property should be expropriated and put to communal use or anything like that and if he had, he would have been out of the race way sooner than he was because the democratic party would have sabotaged the shit out of him.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Obviously this is part one of a series but isn't there something to be said about the trade-offs of capitalism and other systems? Ultimately, alienation and other classical Marxist criticisms of capitalism are accurate but compared to other economic systems, we seem to have been able to eliminate absolute poverty at an outstanding rate, many of the issues which used to plague people in the 20th century are virtually gone now, and it all around seems like there are substantially positive welfare effects to permitting markets to efficiently operate even if it may lack any real compassion or concern. The amount of production and wealth that is created in capitalism has the side benefit of permitting societies to invest in services that otherwise they could not afford. Contrast to other systems around the world, I think it's a big difference.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I can't exactly blame you for misunderstanding the Marxist critique of reformism when most 'Marxists' don't actually understand it. But the element that is missing is that fundamentally, you are still viewing the world through an idealist lens. And I don't mean idealism as in the colloquial sense of being idealistic, but rather of the philosophical position that social reality is ultimately immaterial, and determined by ideas.  Your response to the ongoing social problems of capitalist society and the economic contradictions inherent in political economy is fundamentally one of changing people's minds. From the reformist position which you seem uncomfortable with but seem to always fall back on, it is fundamentally a matter of 'corrupt' systems, of bad people in office, and these matters can be changed by convincing people to get out the vote, and implement redistributive policies, a 'peaceful' alternative to violent revolution.  But ultimately, it's not non-violent. The state is institutionalized violence, and the program of social democracy relies upon the coercive powers of the state to function. But beyond that, the idealist position is flawed for a number of reasons. Capitalism isn't shitty because a bunch of 'reptiles' are in charge. It is fundamentally a misanthropic system, and the economic demands for capital to accumulate and circulate are beyond the control of any individual.  Classic social democracy didn't die because a cabal willed neoliberalism into being. The rate of profit inexorably fell, and the economies across the western world were in deep systemic crisis throughout the 70s. The end result destroyed the protectionist state mediated capitalism that made such welfarism possible. And in many cases, it was precisely social democratic parties that implemented this transition.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I don't think movements to increase wages and provide acceptable healthcare are useful for anything but building popular support. Reform is a bandage over an infected wound, it does little but disguise the fact that your condition is fatal. Revolution is the alcohol that cleanses that wound, and though it may sting for a moment you will survive. Doubtlessly, it is better to have the bandage than nothing at all, but it's not the cure we should strive for.  Regardless of how these reforms will benefit us, it should not be forgotten that the capitalist will use other methods to maintain his profits (dented as they would be by social reforms). In our modern age, this is generally achieved by moving jobs overseas (generally to less industrialized countries without such regulations). This encourages exploitation of third-world countries by larger, more industrialized countries. While we may achieve our goals of increasing the minimum wage, it could have the effect of opening more sweatshops in developing nations. Such economic imperialism should be taken into account before we take to the streets to lightly improve our own situation.  So, while certain reforms should be sought after, this is not the end goal. There is no point in reforming capitalism that it becomes socialism. Reform will never resolve the exploitation and alienation of the working class. Every move should be in preparation for revolution.  That being said, I think you're attracting a lot of people to leftism. This was a video of astounding quality and craftsmanship.

"While I agree with ContraPoints on most issues, she (is this your preferred pronoun?) is frankly wrong in this video.  The fundamental problem with critiques of capitalism is not that the critiques are wrong per se - it's the failure to put those problems in the context of history.  Compared to the issues that humans have had throughout history, the problems of 'alienation' and cultural problems that we have today are nothing compared to being unable to get basic needs, having huge rates of child mortality, and lackl of education to name a few.   Previously third world countries in Asia that have embraced capitalism such as Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and (more recently) China have experienced incredible increases in standard of living.  Such increases have never been seen in other non-capitalist systems - the average economic growth of the Soviet Union, being the most major non-capitalist society in the modern era, was significantly lower than of the United States during the period.  Furthermore, ContraPoints makes some straw mans of capitalist thoughts.  For instance, she states that a cornerstone of capitalist thought is that we are autonomous and rational beings.  However, the most recent nobel prize went to a behavioral economist, a field that explores the ways in which we are not rational and is rapidly growing.  Despite these changes, the field of economics still has not, and likely never will, embrace  planned economies (the only alternative to market systems).  This is they do not stand up to virtually any deep empirical or theoretical criticisms.  Another factual mistake that ContraPoints makes is the assertion that in the United States, basic needs are not generally met.  While there are serious issues in this country, literal starvation is exceptionally rare, especially when put in historical contexts.  The two main issues she cites are medical debt and student debt.  However, firstly, both of these issues are ones that only occur in the context of societies that are already thriving in which people expect to have health insurance and be educated, expectations that have not been the case throughout human history.  Furthermore, these issues can all be addressed in a capitalist framework.  Plenty of capitalist countries have universal health care and more subsidization for education than the U. S.  Using the U. S. as a posterboy for capitalism is disingenuous.  I actually agree with ContraPoints' fundamental preface - that economic systems should increase well-being.  But capitalism is doing that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I think a lot of this is a little dishonest relative to your usual stuff. I only really wanna look at one example because I think you will know what I mean given one example. I also think that it is irrelevant to the specific points you make about class angst and social justice. I only point out that your reasoning is very imprecise and coddles people focused on petty resentment.   Take the Comcast employee/CEO comparison.  You say:   - CEO makes 32 million/year - you make 14 dollars an hour --> this means that a lot of value you produce goes right up the chain of command  This is purposely dishonest I have to imagine.   Compare annual. 28k vs 32000k. Number of employees: ~150k. Let's say that 145000 of these are average 28k, 5000 are average of (generously) 128k. One at 32000k. 532000k would be the surplus if everyone were reduced to 28k. That divided by 150k is about 3.5k. So, assuming you don't care about seniority, specialization of skill, premiums on responsibility, etc, the huge amount you would be losing to upper management is something like 12-13%. If you only look at the CEO, that would be ~200/employee, less than a percent of annual salary.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hi, ContraPoints. Your videos are fun and thoughtful. Thanks. A few quick points. The Soviet Union and Maoist China are complete non-starters. Let's not even go there. Unless we're not sure that they were complete disasters - which of course they were. I would only bother to discuss these dinosaurs with residual Trots and Maoists (and I don't think I've ever met a Maoist). Otherwise, for most people, it's a distraction to even raise them. And to make of them some kind of point or argument in the mouth of a hypothetical radical smacks almost of straw man. Now, about revolution. I agree that a direct confrontation with the capitalist system is impractical, to say the least. We are unarmed, obviously, and can't count on defections on the part of the armed forces; there are no Kronstadt sailors in the modern world. So our task is to come up with other, more imaginative, creative ways of disrupting and undermining the system. Part of that has to  be free public education, which is why work such as yours is important and valuable. But there have to be other things too. We need to think carefully about how the capitalist system works and what its weaknesses are and then attack it at those points. It is a complex system - the financial sub-system, for example  - which means there have to be many weaknesses in the technical infrastructure. I don't have the answers; it's something I think about. But next time you do a discussion on What To Do, such as the one in this video, I would love to see some brainstorming about real concrete measures, instead of some fairly obvious points (no offence) about how it's not 1917 anymore (though this is true, and unfortunately it's a point that might actually need to be made) and about Marxist jargon, etc. (I realise this is only Part 1.) Of course, that isn't easy. But we might start by trying to at least identify which parts of capitalism are more vulnerable and open to attack - and greater focus may open up possible strategies. Finally, none of this means of course that we cannot also do whatever we can in terms of more conventional, reformist politics and industrial action, etc.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I love this video. I missed the old ContraPoints style of humor. And it really is on point, with the critiques of capitalism, and with the critique of the fact that socialists have no real workable plan. As a liberal shill however, I can't help but point out that social democrats do have a solution, and it works pretty well. The Scandinavian vision of capitalism works, and not just in Scandinavia. First New Zealand, then Germany, now France. Social democracy gets hate from both sides because it's a compromise, and both sides constantly try to break the truce or accuse the other of doing so. With an effective and fair political system, the truce can be held in balance, and it clearly works pretty well.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The Rich Man and the Poor Man: An Honest Dialogue The poor man: You have all the money in the world, a beautiful wife, more power than anyone would ever need, but let me ask you this: are you happy?  The rich man: Uhhh (chuckles) Yeah, yeah, of course, I'm happy.  The poor man: If you say so...  The rich man: Jesus...Let me the direct the stupid question to you. You have nothing, are you happy?  The poor man: Yes.  The rich man: Why? Why are you happy?  The poor man: You are implying that I need wealth in order to be happy.  The rich man: I am.  The poor man: Don't you know that happiness comes from within?  The rich man: All I know is poverty doesn't buy happiness.  The poor man: Nothing buys happiness. Happiness is to be achieved not bought.  The rich man: How can you achieve happiness when you have nothing?  The poor man: How can you achieve happiness when you have everything?  The rich man: I have freedoms you don't. If you think you're free, try doing anything when you have no money. Now it's your turn to answer my question: how can you achieve happiness when you don't have anything?  The poor man: The poor man has the drive that builds civilizations; the rich man has no motivation.  The rich man: I have no motivation? How do you think I got this money?  The poor man: You used the motivation to become rich and you lost it when you did.  The rich man: You don't know anything about me. How do you know I'm not constantly working to provide a better life for my family?  The poor man: Because you don't need to work to provide a better life for your family; you already have what you need and if you still work despite this it's because you're addicted to power and work and that's no better than having no motivation in the first place.  The rich man: If work isn't the meaning of life than what is?  The poor man: Work is not the meaning of life; work is what brings you to the meaning of life.  The rich man: What meaning of life? You keep talking about it but you don't even know what it is.  The poor man: The meaning of life is what you want but will never get, what you work to achieve but never do, what keeps you going when times are tough, what gives you life in the face of death.  The rich man: You don't think I have that?  The poor man: I don't think you don't have that; I know you don't.  The rich man: Let me ask you something: if I offered you a million dollars right now, no strings attached, would you take it?  The poor man: No.  The rich man: Are you serious? No, really. Are you joking?  The poor man: I wouldn't take a million dollars I didn't earn, for that money would be tainted with blood. After all, the meaning of life is worth more than all the money in the world.  The rich man: You can have both! You can have money and meaning.  The poor man: One day your motivation for power will subside and you will realize the dollar is not real; the dollar is not the goal it is the means by which we achieve our goal.

"Dear ContraPoints,  Fantastic video, as always! I love all of your thoughts as well as your video-making style. You do a terrific job at broadcasting leftist ideas to a broad audience. I mean, sixty-nine THOUSAND subscribers?? It's amazing to see how much you have grown!  I really love that you want to delve deeply into the 'reform' versus 'revolution' debate. Of course, you are right it is best to use all the tactics we have at our disposal (within reason) to move closer to the society that we want.  I'm no authority on any of this stuff, (obviously) but this is what I think: When it comes to reforms, we should aim to pass those that truly undermine capitalism rather than try to save it, such as a universal employment guarantee and the socialization of industry. As for insurrection, we should never use preemptive violence, as that contorts our struggle into something that it is not. We need to show people that we are fighting for their liberation from their oppressors, not needlessly inflicting pain against our enemies. We should organize to defend ourselves when we have to and capitalize on all of the ways we have of resisting peacefully.  Anyways, those are just my two cents. I'd be flattered if you even read this, gosh you're so cool. By the way, thank you for introducing me to Bela Fleck's Bach, I really enjoyed that. Have a restful day, and stay awesome!  Yours Sincerely, Caleb L. Carman","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Did Tabby really just unironically cite the Soviet and Red Party revolutions as goals to strive for? Last I checked, neither China nor the USSR did anything to actually end oppression; all they did was have Lenin, Stalin, and Mao seize power for themselves, and use it to oppress the masses in a different way. Now, don't get me wrong, I support revolution, just not theirs. Any revolution of mine would seek to end all systems of authority, all of which designed to oppress. Capitalism is not a unique evil and source of oppression. Dictatorship under the guise of communism or nationalism are just as evil, just as oppressive, and just as dangerous.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a 'Dirty Centrist', progressive/socialist policy really tugs at my heart-strings, but there are some fundamental questions that it seems progressives just can't answer:  1) What are the appropriate levels of taxation for different incomes? (Thomas Piketty says 80% on income $1M+) 2) How much estimated Gov't revenue would be generated at those levels? (I can't find any data on this, but I can find articles that attack these tax rate directly: URL 3) For whatever Gov't revenue is generated, how would it be directed to social programs (I personally estimate that Healthcare, Education, Infrastructure & Poverty are all trillion dollar+ endeavors, so $4T to devote to each as a START)  I get that capitalism comes with a multitude of social, environmental and inter-personal issues, but unless progressives can provide some concrete answers to the above questions, ultimately people are going to choose Centrist Dems over Far Left Progressives, because we can't shake the nagging feeling that a lot of these economic policies are feel-good fantasy.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"'Used as a slur against queer teenagers'... I hope you mean queer as in 'Oh that's queer' and not 'Yeah, I'm queer.' The distinction is massive. buuut... Lets take this from the top.  *Spiritual Bullshittery* Capitalism doesn't exist to make everyone happy. It exists to facilitate trade, and the circulation of goods using something of shared, agreed, value. -- Money. In Capitalism you are directly responsible for your own happiness. You make it, or you don't.  *Shitty Jobs* Again, your job is dictated by, majorly, your actions. The earnings of your job are not dictated by how much they earn the company, but by how quickly and cheaply they can replace you. That is why you are always told to 'Stick in at school'. As for companionship? Its a hit and miss, and you don't provide citations either way. You called shitty jobs oppressive; That may be an appropriate descriptor for how it feels, but not how it actually is.  *Advertising* Capitalism is driven by desire. Manufactured or not. We are autonomous beings driven by our free will. But we are still animals and we have natural urges and desires. We can choose to ignore these desires and urges; one of the many reasons that those who desire to kill someone are jailed after doing so. I think you misunderstand marketing. Movies do this a lot too... Its not about making new desires. Its about using and redirecting your biological desires into something that can be used. Capitalism isn't about meeting basic human needs for everyone. Its about meeting basic human needs for those who *WORK FOR IT*. You quote the bad but curiously don't quote the good (Well, this video is named 'What's wrong with capitalism' -- I'll wait until 'What's right with capitalism' comes out and I'll say this one again.)

"This is a great indictment of a certain type of capitalism, but nobody who isn't a Republican or Libertarian doesn't see the problem with this sort of capitalism. I have never seen evidence that a system that rejects free markets entirely can succeed. The fact is you need incentives to do the enormous amount of work required to move the massive amounts of resources to their approximately efficient end goal. Not only the incentive of profit (which is why compensation for labor must always be less than the value it creates, as unfair as this seems; the Christians of the middle ages thought it was unfair too, which is why society stayed stagnant and miserably poor until this thinking changed), but the incentive of fear of loss. If you're not worried that an investment may be rejected by the market, you're mindlessly investing in resources that the market may reject. This was a huge problem is soviet Russia.  Whenever a liberal like myself writes something like this, I'm always met with accusations that I'm out of touch, insensitive to the needs of the poor, etc. On the contrary. Living standards have never been higher than in the age of liberal capitalism. There's nothing that even comes close to comparison. And while I agree that we need to do a LOT more - there is a lot of economic injustice - you don't need to dismantle capitalism to do it. Just practice a different form of it. Of course in doing so you might get purist libertarians who say this isn't capitalism at all, but it still is.   The problem with revolutions, either with ballots or bullets, is that unless you strip away democracy you need to convince a comfortable majority in society that it's a good idea to rule this way. Otherwise you might get a Trotskyan one election cycle and a Donald Trump the next. Good luck doing it in the USA, where opinion is split 50/50 on pretty much everything. I personally think American society is fucked for this exact reason, and the only thing that's ever going to form the kind of sane consensus that leads to actual progress is an ENORMOUS disaster that strips away ideology and forces us to look straight into the gaping black hole in our society.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

They're starting to realize that they're fucking mad, and before that crowd of people explodes, they need to be educated on the common causes of misery in the US (systemic economic injustice, systemic racial injustice, etc).

The means of production, after all, were still held firmly by a non-democratic and politically unaccountable minority. Lenin's vanguard party, alas, had all the fun.   The question remains, however. If the USSR is a poor example to follow, what is the alternative?   Also of note: both the Russian and Chinese empires were agrarian monarchies with very little that a devoted Marxist would consider prerequisite for a revolution that got beyond capitalism. In other words, they're very far from examples that meet our current situation. They may serve as useful historical analogies or cautionary tales or what have you, but play-by-play guides for how we ought to proceed they very much are not.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I really do enjoy all the characters in your videos but I don't know if they're an effective way to present the arguments... they veer too close to caricatures and strawpeople a bit too often. At least in my view. And it ends up coming off as Moderate Leftist Lecturing Radical Leftists Who Are Too Childish To Realise The Error Of Their Ways.   I mean I've been following similar debates a lot lately but they were entirely between revolutionary anarchists, because we're not actually cartoon characters. We do talk about these things and look at situations case by case and try to be pragmatic and realistic. We just had a whole discussion about potentially pushing for UBI because we are very aware of the fact that immediate concerns exist and matter and it's worth considering the costs and benefits. Many of us desperately need the immediate relief ourselves. We also do work with moderates and other leftists, quite a lot even. It's often practical, even if there is some debate over the matter.  I mean maybe Tabby is just a young online activist with no connections to real life groups and no experience (which is what she sounds like to me) but I feel like then the solution is to get her some comrades to talk things over with.  As for the revolution thing btw, I don't think anyone realistically has such a naive idea of how revolutions happen. Nobody thinks you can just hand out some pamflets and start an insurrection whenever you want. Okay maybe a handful of people, idk. But typically what happens is that there is some sort of a build up to it which changes the balance of power and the public opinion. Some sort of tension or chaos or even a split in the ruling class. You assume that it'll be civilians against cops and the army but it's not at all unheard of that the cops or even the army (or a part of them) might side with the insurgents if the people in power fuck up enough. Or you can have a situation where the people in power genuinely don't dare to use their violence machine.   It can't really be manufactured so you can only wait for the right moment and hope for the best. I can't predict the future, I don't know if this'll happen in our lifetime in our countries, but it's not as absurd as you seem to think. Basically I recommend reading about revolutionary history. I promise it's not boring.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"In my opinion, the difference between democratic (I prefer 'reform') and revolutionary socialism is minute and almost trivial.  The ruling class will not surrender their powers without a fight, the French feudal aristocracy refused to concede basic rights to the peasants. Today, it is the capitalist class which wields the state. Though they have not and will not capitulate without a fight, that does not mean we must avoid engaging the ruling class and demand reform. Democratic and revolutionary socialism are two sides of the same coin, socialism is inherently both democratic and revolutionary. To aggrandize one and disparage the other is damaging to the anti-capitalist movement.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Loved the video but it feels like you're trying a little hard to make Tabby into a strawperson. We shouldn't be against general strikes, in fact I think it's good starting praxis.

We should still fight for abortion rights and everything else. It's not like we're going to be like 'Nope, not socialist, not priority.' I don't think I've ever seen any leftist (except for maybe the assholes, 'brocialists', etc) say we should ignore important topics like, say, police brutality, or aforementioned birth control rights, trans rights, etc., and anyone who does is not my comrade and most likely wouldn't be represented well by a queer vampiric anti-fascist bat-wielding catgirl furry, the icon of leftist trans girls the world over (thank you for her btw, I know you intended her to be what was 'wrong' with the left, but she gave voice to all of us underprivileged folk who had no voice and needed an outlet through which they could express their rage at the oppressive system <3)  Sorry if this is long-winded, but I guess I'm just trying to say, when I look at the left, I don't only see people who hate just capitalism, I see people who just want to make things less shitty in general.

I need to actually DO shit to make a change. Bitching at conservatives on Twitter does nothing to change anything.

"Love your work, but I wasn't a fan of this one. I think you're criticism of capitalism could have been better. Materialism has existed with and without capitalism, why else do tribal chiefs decorate their selves with jewels and headdresses and such? It's about status and that is a part of humans when they coexist in a community.  You give too much credit to advertisements and not enough to people. I think you're making the mistake of looking at people as a collective, rather than as individuals, which I understand is hard to do. But most people I know avoid ads like the plague and the best way to sell a product is by word of mouth. I do agree with you on some aspects of your criticism of ads, but I think this topic requires a more objective analysis. As I said, ads are representative to status, which exists independently of capitalism (but I admit, gets a boost under it). You may be getting too Utopian. Unfortunately, the reality is that we DON'T live in a pure capitalist society. We live in a mixed system, so there's no simple answer.  What you're proposing would require a top down centralized approach. So instead of ads coming at us from every which direction and going to dead end jobs, the gov't would TELL us what we want and what we will do. I'm just not a fan of this either.

It is high time the radical left crawls out of their sectarian and dogmatic echo-chambers and start talking to each other and the rest of the left again. And I mean talking, and not throwing accusations of opportunism back and forth. For so long a siege mentality has held sway within the radical left, all the while fetishizing revolutions from the 20th century.  Should we read Marx? yes, but we should also read Bakunin and Kropotkin. Should we read Lenin? Yes, but we should also read Pannekoek and Luxemburg. And above all, we maybe should spend a little less time reading and a little more time looking at the current state of the world, and draw our own, 21st century conclusions.  Will we be able to make the capitalists bow to our will? Will reformism inevitably result in a kind of mild Keynesian capitalism, but still keep the masses bound in wage-slavery? Will revolutionary fervour always result in the horrors of Stalinist authoritarianism? I honestly do not know the answers to these questions.

"The answer is actually surprisingly simple yet difficult and time consuming. Slowly work on replacing all important corporations with democratically run co-operatives so to fundamentally undermine the source of corporate power, ie. the money consumers pay for the products and put that power in the source of democratically run entities. Trying to permanently limit capitalist corporate power through law and government will never be anything more than a speed-bump for them. How do you do this in an individual level? 1. See if you can buy the products that you are already buying regularly from a co-operative that already exists. If this is too hard, at least try to by locally sourced and from companies that you know don't pay their workers slave wages even if what you want to buy is more expensive and you have to wait longer to buy it. You'll fail to resist, but keep trying. This is like dieting level hard. 2. Apply for a job at a co-operative yourself and help them with your personal productivity. Note that this is not about charity. This is about a paid job. 3. Usual stuff about finding like minded people in the meat-world (actually fucking meeting people in person who agree with you about capitalism being terrible etc.) and organize and start your own co-operative and compete with some capitalist corporation to, as they like to say, 'make it redundant'. Often this will devolve into shouting because there's nothing worse to our leftist cause then us getting together and all knowing how fucking right we are and only if those assholes would just shut up for a moment to listen to you. Again, persist and be patient. Also, in times like this many of the suggestions will be about getting into politics. Remember, we have already tried this. Politics can help but they will never be a complete solution. The need that the corporations create (artificial or not) needs to be met by democratic entities to finally undermine the capitalists real power. Money from us, the filthy masses. 4. Some politics are necessary to play interference when the capitalist try to end the right of co-operatives to exists via their favourite means, political mind control (ie. bribery and threats).  The best thing about this method is that it's gradual and non-violent. Just replace the lego-bricks one by one. Maybe you think that this is pipe-dream? You might be surprised to know that there are thousands and thousands of co-operatives all around the world already. Even your local bakery might be one! Just search online, there's already lots of em. Do note that just because some company is a co-operative doesn't mean that it's perfect or practices perfect ethics in business or how it treats its workers, but it's much harder to fuck workers over when they have a vote on how the products are produces, when, where, how and how the profits are spent.  This is the only non violent way that I know of that might someday end capitalism. I'm not holding my breath or anything, but it would be nice. Thanks for the video.

Liberal politics tends not to address it because they more or less support capitalism (by believing it has the potential to be benevolent).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Does Private Baldrick's analysis (which I share) of the reasons for the start of world war one in 'Blackadder Goes Forth' have any bearing on the rise of gamergate, the alt right and President Donald Trump? Baldrick's analysis was; 'No, the thing is: The way I see it, these days there's a war on, right? And, ages ago, there wasn't a war on, right? So, there must have been a moment when there not being a war on went away, right? And there being a war on came along. So, what I want to know is: How did we get from the one case of affairs to the other case of affairs?' to which Captain Blackadder dutifully replied; Do you mean, 'how did the war start?'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"What is needed is for capitalism is regulated in a manner that is favorable to the 'common person'.  Right now it is indeed regulated, but it is regulated by those who's interests are only towards the mega corporations, and affiliates.  Look the fact we have a whole sector of people making HUGE amounts of money basically doing a form of legalized AND state sanctioned gambling (also known as the stock market) that until a few decades ago was only for the ultra rich should honestly have been a clarion call that the system is corrupt.  This is the issue though.  Capitalism, and the want of things are a good thing...but not as it is being implemented now.  This video started with some succinct points about advertising, and for us wanting to get things we don't really 'need'.  Also in this video 'Tabby' (I think that is the revolutionarie's name in this vid) was wearing a pair of leggings that if I am not mistaken are from Black Milk Clothing, in Australia.   Black milk is an example of how capitalism CAN work.  This one guy wanted to produce awesome leggings, got the funds together and started his own business, and with some risk, but look at his business now.  Here is the thing...I don't think Black Milk is in the Market.  It is not a corporation.  It is when companies 'go public' is when they seem to for lack of a better term...'go evil'.  The answers to fixing this I truly think from a mixture of highly regulated capitalism, WITH socialism.  For sure the for profit, publicly traded, healthcare system needs to go away.   It is also just disgusting that in what is one of the most wealthy nations on the planet there are homeless people in droves.   On another note.  REALLY good video!!!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It wouldnt solve everything; we are going to have to deal with our consumerism problem among many other things regardless.   to me the problem with capitalism is finding a way to punish greed/ corruption while still giving great rewards to ambition and hard work. no matter what system you have, if you have evil greedy lizard men running the show, its going to be fuct.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i do think one should be careful to see marxism as a reaction against the evils of the bourgeoise, considering they are also slaves under the logic of a market which is far above any of our control. a large part of communism is about mankind taking control over the forces of production, rather than the forces of production reproducing themselves endlessly through us.  that said, of course the bourgeoise is the prime defender of the status quo and the revolution will of course be against them, but not against them because they are 'evil'. getting stuck in only defeating the representations, rather than the origin of representation itself, will always lead to capital being able to restructure itself around, and assimilate resistance.  i do believe a capitalism which is no better than the current one, while not having a defined bourgeoise represented in a specific class, is possible, and might be what we are heading towards, if not this whole neoreaction and CEO-god-emperor thing is the next thing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've thought about this one. I honestly think that Capitalism can be subverted. There's no reason why you couldn't apply Marxist theory to a small corporate entity. In fact, from a business perspective, there are a lot of compelling reasons to do it. Time to market, turnaround, faster response to real-world conditions, and so on. Enough smaller high productivity groups will eventually strangle out the big slow moving corporate dinosaurs, and there isn't a damned thing you can do about it, without hurting the very creature of capitalism.  It can be done without radical change to the system, even though the idea would constitute a radical change to the system itself. My plan revolves around financing. Change the moral considerations around investment, what it is, who benefits, for how long... and the whole system tilts.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Isn't this a grass is greener type situation? Like are you sure you would be happier under socialism? Pretty sure even socialist counties have dead end jobs that need doing. Maybe the pay and conditions are better under the state owned telco monopoly call center, but then again its still going to involve you listening to the complaints of comrades having to deal with technical issues and whats the difference with alienation to a private boss versus working for the state. People feel alienated when working for the public sector, arguably more so as the state is much bigger there for you are further away from the benefits of success. (This is why I work for a small company, its more humane)  There is something seriously wrong with Marxist Leninism and Maoism we can talk about that. I would love to know what a Leftist criticism of the soviet system would be. I know what capitalists and liberals say but a socialist perspective would be interesting.  I'm not saying you are advocating either of those systems, but there seems to be a lack of articulation of what changes to bring in will lead to a desired result. So far all I've ever heard, from any socialist advocating systemic change boils down to:  Step 1: Raise class consciousness of the masses Step 2: Over through the bourgeois Step 3: ?????? Step 4: Star Trek  next generation type socialist utopia  I'm not trying yo white knight for capitalism here by any means, capitalism certainly has its problems, my opinion is to reform and be more like german and Scandinavian countries. IE. Third way, social market economics.

Another set of ideas are those of transhumanism, the U.S. Transhumanist Party for example, who think, debate and consider a world that is post-scarcity.

"A lot of people who consider themselves capitalists would agree that the problems identified in each chapter are 'problems', they just wouldn't assign the blame for those things directly to capitalism. They call such problems things like 'corporatism' (an actual branch of fascism advocated by the likes of Mussolini), and 'consumerism' (which rejects the more rational, materialist descriptions of economics favoured by Thoreau, who placed the value of free time well above the value of practically everything else). The perils of false advertising and rhetorical suggestion are by no means restricted to capitalism - Natalie herself has been quite open about pushing the use of rhetoric to persuade irrational viewers rather than focusing on their need to be better educated. Under other economic systems it's likely a similar broadscale rhetoric would be employed to convince people they 'don't' need products. A deceleration of needs can be just as dangerous as the acceleration, if it means stripping people of the personal products they actually 'do' need to make living worthwhile, and should those products are regarded as unnecessary by those in power.  Though that said, it is also easy for someone who labels themself a 'capitalist' to groan when they hear a critique of capitalism on these terms. It's a bit like what Natalie is saying when she refuses to identify with a political ideology; what actually matters is a nominalist interpretation, the physical body of problems and perceivable actions one can take rather than an abstract umbrella of overlapping classifications used to impose order on seeming chaos. There are problematic actions and behaviors which can be restricted by laws and regulations, but others which are perfectly fine, while still being part of a 'capitalist' system - rewarding innovation, for example, or philanthropy. While the U.S calls itself 'Capitalist', it's actually a democracy run by vying elements of the free market, government, and socialist unions. The 'umbrella' idea of Capitalism is a fiction, and THAT's what's wrong with it. It's impossible to fix or destroy or interact with a universal abstract. I think most capitalists reject the umbrella idea of capitalism in favour of specific policies that attract them, just like communists resent being lumped under a singular idea of 'Red Terror'.  Though the most interesting thing about this video is its intended audience, and what it is persuading them to do. Natalie flattered the Alt-Right by reflecting a great deal of their symbols and signs, trolling fascism in its native language to great effect. It would be wrong to assume that this video isn't doing exactly the same thing to the radical communist left. It certainly isn't aimed at any capitalists miraculously unaware of the institutional evils of the western world, ready to have their eyes opened. It spends its first course confirming the intended audience's beliefs, flattering them by reflecting their worldview (specifically the idea of 'vulgar communism', the conspiracy of rich corporate 'lizard-people' running the world behind closed doors), and then graciously points out the flaws in their methods before suggesting a shift away from radicalism to co-operative democracy. There's something great about that. Because it's attacking the 'umbrella' idea of capitalism not by engaging or changing capitalists, who she presumably doesn't have much of an audience with, but by changing communists, who she does. That's the kind of combative strategy that may actually make the internet a more effective realm of discourse.   I mean, I still think it's a bit duplicitous, which is why this handy note is here for anyone who'd prefer to be aware of the rhetorical tools at work. But I do admire her style.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"1. Brilliant as always.   2. Always love the musical endings.   3. So this is the first video where the premise of the video is one that I, at least nominally, disagree with.   Are we taking it as read that American style capitalism is capitalism and everything else is Socialism? In which case I'm a gosh darn socialist! However, unless the definition of capitalism is very narrow and the definition of Socialism is so broad as to be a little meaningless, aren't most young people in the US arguing for something like Scandinavian style capitalism? Does it matter? Is that an entirely semantic argument? OR does the confusing use of terms cause confusion in politics and therefore create more division despite the two sides being closer than they think?    Those aren't rhetorical questions. My instinct is that the confusing use of the terms socialism and capitalism really does cause unnecessary confusion but equally that might just be semantics and not matter at all. I really don't know but I'd like to.

"Before you can bring change, I think you'd have to first start showing an alternative way of living. A small step towards this could be purchasing some cheap land somewhere and putting a community of container homes(or other alternative buildings) on it. You'd still need to run some business to import the necessary materials for living, etc but the ability to cut down your living cost dramatically while having on-site jobs that don't require you to work 9-5 like dogs would be a yuge step (imo) towards showing people alternatives. This could be a temp setup where you bring interested people in for 6 months at a time to try out. This should be enough time to de-program the avg person from thinking they require the typical life.

Contra, you need to be consistent, you start out by having Tabitha act all childish and press her to provide a example of what needs to be done, but then when she actually starts explaining her point and lists people who, while yes, they wrote books that are long and tedious, actually did propose alternative systems, you then proceed to essentially accuse her of being boring.  I get this method of argument is useful when dealing with people who are at risk of falling for the alt right, who usually want a argument and not a debate, but if that's the case you should focus more on them.

"Yeah if we just unite against the 'real enemy': the mutual exchange of goods via a currency we can stop the huge environmental, social and cultural damage brought on by massive immigration, particularly from non-white overpopulated countries. Donate to my Patreon, PayPal or buy my merch to help fight the evils of capitalism.  You complain about expensive education, health care, etc. without talking about capitalism's desire to increase the population via massive immigration?  Seriously, I have issues directly related to capitalism. The unending growth and destruction of the environment, exploitation of the third world (in part via immigration/'brain drain') and the desire of big businesses to open the borders and bring millions of low wage labour into the country, which is bad for the environment. The view of people and nature as simply economic assets as opposed to distinct ecosystems, ethnicities and cultures with families, identities and values is part of the problems of capitalism you could address. But that might make you acknowledge that European-descended people have identities and group interests, which might sound 'raaccccissssttt' so you probably won't address it.  You can criticize many aspects of the Alt-Right but if you can't address this fundamental issue of the need to end massive immigration, no one is 'switching sides' to team up with you. Your main criticisms of them seem to focus on their less important, almost trivial issues like opposition to Trans people, gay marriage, the influence of Hollywood, etc. I think they only view those things as threats because they all seem politically aligned to the idea that white people aren't interesting or worthy of autonomy or that we need to triple our populations and make ourselves minorities in our own countries.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"0:11  This is a question that just seems wrong. These people did not decide to die nor did they even decide to risk death in any meaningful way. They died from an extremely unlikely cause that we should not fear. There was no reason from their perspective and there is no reason from any kind of sensible perspective either. They died because a bunch of horrible people thought that murdering thousands would be a good way to draw attention. Their deaths was a wholly unneccesary tragedy that only sparked much more violence in the years to come. I know that is not an optimistic message but we all need to realise that violence, death, war and terrorism are ussually just all bad, with no or not nearly enough redeeming qualities. If we keep that in mind we'll hopefully think twice before we escalate situations needlessly.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

But we are stuck looking at each other in despair from behind a philosophical barbed wire fence. I agree with a lot of what Marx said about Capitalism and the multinational industrialists but i disagree deeply with his prescription of remedy. As i disagree with Marx, I disagree philosophically with your ideals of equality and internationalism,  believing that they are fundamentally anti-reality/biology, thus will always lead to tyranny, forced assimilation and despair for the human soul. There needs to be a third or fourth or fifth position instead of the materialist dichotomies of communism or capitalism.

"Excellent video. Capitalism serves as the one-word answer to 'what is wrong with the planet' - from why our environment is being destroyed to why poverty is increasing despite technology improving, from decades long warfare to the decay and farcical state of democracy, from the growth of the far right in alienated white men and fascist leaning of the capitalist class to the general misery that has come to afflict near all trapped inside the fascist machine.  I think we can achieve so much as a species if we focus on capitalism as the primary issue with the world - it encompasses every element of our society and serves as a cause for all actions that go against the wellbeing of the planet. Discourse that goes through a lens of demonstrating how capitalism is affecting people on a day-to-day scale, and then on a global perspective, can go a long way - and actives a class conscious movement that can produce gusto.  Anyway, ContraPoints is one of the best on this site and I hope she continues making videos like this - it's terrific :)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I love the way you acted Tabby here. You always give her very good points to say, but there is also a immaturity to her that she can't seem to grasp and therefore can't overcome yet. I guess that 'Contra' herself is also a Persona in most of your videos, forgive me if I got that wrong, so I think it's worth debating that she has to drop that motherly way of talking to Tabby. Everytime I see Contra and Tabby together I think of an Adult Millennial (Contra) speaking to a Teenager (Tabby) - Contra seems to think that she figured life out and that a less radical approach is always the best way of doing things - can't allienate the centrists!! - but seems to fail to understand that 'radical' isn't a synonym to 'not appropriate' or 'un reasonable'. She seems to have abandoned the idea of being radical a long time ago, either because she found better approaches or she just grew out of it. Either way, when they have a conversation she always seems to talk down to Tabby because of her experience in life, changed views etc. It's like a mother talking to her daughter essentially. I think Tabby needs to grow out of the safe spot of marxist theory and evaluate what is best for the reality she lives in, but Contra needs to learn to see Tabby as an equal - not an slightly misguided ally.

"I have to admit, I find the idea of a violent revolution to overthrow the bourgeoisies very appealing, but mostly because I feel like the odds are stacked against us. There are 0 parties who oppose Capitalism, and even fewer who are genuinely left wing. Here in the UK we're stuck with the First Past the Post voting system which means we effectively only have two choices on who we want to win.  Then in the US, the Republican controlled house and senate constantly trying to restrict voting access just stacks the deck against anyone remotely left-leaning. Hell, the Democrats just refuse to have any flare with their candidates, sticking to centre-right ideologies and attempting to compromise with uncompromising.   Bernie Sanders was the only one who was openly left-wing, and the Democrats rejected him.

"I SWEAR to god!! Everything is in a vacuum with you anti capitalists. Capitalism is not 'a thing in and of itself.' capitalism is a thing COMPARED to something else. It isn't 'is capitalism bad or good?' Its 'is capitalism BETTER than other forms of economy such as communism or socialism?' If a store sells shitty products, it will go out of business in capitalist economy. In Communist economy, if your local government retailer sells shitty products, you may go pound sand. You're welcome. Long live big brother.   Communism  and socialism take away your ability to choose and own and ensures those at the top can't ever lose their power. Sure, there are still winners and losers in capitalism. But in communism and socialism (not to mention caste systems like India and old Great Britain), those of the lower classes literally are kept in their place by law or at least the force of those making laws. Captialism is a hell of alot better than any other system despite its flaws. See what is happening in China where migrant workers are just being herded out of the city without any choice.

"I think you're misunderstanding the meaning of commodity fetishism. It's not about fetishizing consumer items; it's a matter of perceiving human relationships as a matter of economic forces. The *objects* of capitalism stand in for the *subjective* relations that exist in the system. So when we talk about the 'economy growing' or 'keeping inflation in check' it sounds like we're referring to abstractions, but underneath it all there are actual changes in political and social power. What Marx does is foreground these dynamics. Rather than dealing with demand curves and price points, he emphasizes that capitalism is always *political* in character, based on a set of human dynamics that are structured through the process of production.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This was excellent!  I don't think capitalism can be 'overthrown' or 'ended'. Too many people have lived in capitalism, for too long, for there to be any kind of smooth transition to anything else. What we need is exactly as you said: Small, measurable goals, and improvements to capitalism as it stands. Then, the larger goal of changing to something else can be achieved, after all the small goals are met.  I say that because I've probablly been brainwashed by the capitalists to desire things, but I like stuff too on its own, regardless of advertising. I love video games, movies, anime, and more. I'm a PC gamer, so I love powerful gaming PCs you can customize with fun parts. I love stupid little collectible things, merchandise, or brands. But, here's the thing: None of these things are BECAUSE of capitalism. The workers made these things, and in a more fair, ethical system, people would WANT to make these things... rather than NEED to make them because they need money to even survive. The problem is with CEOs, shareholders, and more. Unjustified hierarchies. These are the lizards/reptiles you speak of.  Right now, a lot of things that make capitalism fun, such as branding, should exist for the sake of convenience. And advertisement should exist to just tell you that a product exists, rather than tell you that you NEED it. A lot of things that make capitalism good should be taken out of capitalism, such as the ability to create tons of wealth and cool fun things, then inserted into a better system. Because, right now, there's no way that we can comfortablly transfer over to 'socialism' in the traditional sense. Life is hard... but that doesn't mean we should abandon the fun things we enjoy to go 'smash capitalism'. Like, I don't want to stop drawing for people, buying video games, or having a nice computer, to join a violent uprising. That is not feasible. I know it's selfish, but all I can do right now is donate to 'Our Revolution' or Bernie's 'Sanders Institute' to help. I'll do everything I can, such as sign petitions... even if that might not help much. I just want to live a comfortable, happy life.  So, let's focus on small goals, that everyone can agree with, first. Then more can be achieved!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"The problem with Parliamentarianism, getting change done through the system (examples: Bernie Sanders and the Fight for 15), is that it submits to the Capitalists and validates the Bourgeois Democracy we live in. It reinforces the system, as the idea of reforming it has less effort and blood shed than revolution. Rosa Luxemburg and Vladimir Lenin do over this in 'Reform or Revolution' and 'The State and Revolution' respectively if you would like a longer explanation. But for the first world obviously the answer isn't revolution, now at least. The labor aristocracy, the workers who are fattened up on Imperialism and benefits stolen from the third world, do not have 'nothing to lose but their chains'. They also are reactionary in general, most do not even know what socialism is. Practically none have read a single work by Marx, Lenin, Engels, or god forbid Stalin. The course of action is for ML groups to work with anarchists and other leftist groups, sometimes even liberals like the DSA and CPUSA to provide direct aid to the poor and homeless. The Black Panthers did this well. Building class consciousness comes before revolution, and there isn't class consciousness in the USA. And for all leftists, we should be reading our theory. Read Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Hoxha for starters. We should understand Marxist economics and what S/C+V and M-C-M mean. We should also read the works of others, because an echo chamber is not helpful. Reading Kropotkin, Bakunin, Trotsky (yucky), Proudhon, Bookchin, Fukuyama, Smith, Keynes, Mises and so on are helpful. We should be out and spreading the message. We should not fall back on liberal tendencies to refrain from action or attempt Parliamentarianism, as these only subjugate us further to Bourgeois interests. Also, Stalin did nothing wrong but we shouldn't say it to liberals.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"With regard to the questions you raised in the video, I think we need both a minimal program and a maximal program.  MINIMAL PROGRAM  * Unconditional basic income to replace the welfare state * Free healthcare, public transport, and university * The creation of a hell of a lot more cooperatives  * Municipalisation (not nationalisation!) of public utilities * Introduction of worker self-management in public enterprises * Introduction of participatory budgeting programs in neighbourhoods * Devolution of local government power to popular assemblies in communities  * Elimination of all laws prohibiting consensual drug use and sexwork * Phased abolition of intellectual property laws (free the digital Oasis) * Gradual abolition of all border controls and restrictions on the free movement of people * Transition to community-owned green energy utilities and internet   MAXIMAL PROGRAM * Replacement of the state with voluntary confederations of free communes * Replacement of private and state enterprises with self-managed cooperatives  * Fostering a socio-cultural environment which emphasises individual autonomy, consent, unity-in-diversity, and the free egalitarian distribution of power.  I'd echo Kropotkin in saying 'peaceful if possible, violent if necessary', and also add 'through direct action if possible, through state action if necessary'.  Using violent and state means may be necessary at some points along the way, but in both cases should only be pursued when the alternatives (pacific and direct-actionist means) fail.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Well, this is gonna be fun. let's write an angry long-winded comment no one will read. Maybe I should finally buy a mic and turn this into an angry long-winded video no one will listen too. Chapter one As a market socialist who was pro-gamergate I really can't agr HEY, DON'T RUN AWAY!  Anyway, since I'm now under the read more button I don't have to care about length. I do have a few points though.  Part 1 I think it's actually more working and lower-middle class young men. Often also the socially awkward. It's not that we were promised the world and didn't get it. It's that we're having it just as shit as anyone else. That we've been abandoned by the system as well. That effort gets unrewarded and that we feel we don't get a fair chance either.   That fair chance is what it is about. Again, we are not the Jocks, we are not the pretty boys. We are the outcasts. We have not been given much beyond some common decency. We are not privileged.   I oppose the term queer as a useless catch-all. I also oppose the occupation of weirdness by people who act like they represent these people because I'm probably more insane than they are.  That said special snowflakes is not an insult for people who are nonstraight or noncis. Rather it is for people who expect us to give anything beyond common decency. It is connected to the fact that sadly the largest voices are often wealthy and well-connected. For them to demand things feels simply preposterous as they have more than we do.   Of course that doesn't mean I'm going to act like there aren't other minorities that are worse of. There are a lot of problems that need solutions. However, I can't address them because I'm always the scapegoat. We are often put into the box of evil people. Hell, we're put there even more often than the actual upper-class perpetrators. After all a bunch of wierdos aren't going to sue you for libel.  An example is video games. The games you quoted got their share of hate. I won't deny that. But so does any game and those games did not get more than average. Of course you have the 12 ear old kids but in general people just didn't play them if they didn't like them. Look at battlefront 2. According the the orthodoxy people should've sucked it up. But no, they didn't and EA got severe issues from it. Funnily enough gaming is rather anti-corporatist. Hell, gamergate itself was the movement against the consumerism you describe.   I don't really disagree with chapter 2-5 except that the anger already started around 2007/2008/2014. However, I have one last qualm which is thatthe us isn't capitalist.  I mean, in a capitalist society the government would have cracked down on the telecom monopoly ages ago","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"To add to the discussion around revolution vs democratic socialism - those advocating revolution and claiming that democratic means have never worked, fail to realise that revolution itself has also never really worked, hence why Russia is now capitalist and China state capitalist with a communist iPhone case.   The reason WHY revolutionary socialism hasn't worked and imo won't work, is because it scares other countries into becoming defensive because the revolution itself is violent AF.   Democratic Socialism, on the other hand - hasn't 'never worked', it's just not finished. It's a process. America is probably a poor example but in my country, the UK, democratic socialist governments (notably Atlee's) have provided us with institutions like the NHS, strong labour laws and nationalsied industry. We've had a lot of pushback when the postwar consesus ended and the neoliberal consensus began, however with neoliberalism collapsing right now, it's clear the next stage of socialism is about to begin (at least in Britain).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've been waiting for such video from you since the 'The Left' video. Your methods of presenting information are quite impressive and intriguing.  The capitalism is a damn painful problem, and the worst part of it is that the people, whose life is actually being destroyed by it, have no idea what the capitalism or socialism is, most of such economically affected people have no time or desire to be interested in politics and can't tell the difference between the left and the right and don't know for who to vote. And I believe this is the reason why a truly effective revoliucion or any real action in general is barely possible and is going to be like that for decades. Because most of the working class don't know what it is exactly that they are going through. At least in my country political education is basically non-existent and I believe it is like that in most of the countries. The ignorance of proletariat is one of the factors that make the bourgeoisie flourishing. It would be also interesting to hear your points on relations of art and capitalism. Would art with all the individuality it requires be able to exist under socialism? I believe that in a way it is the capitalism that allows, for example, creators like you to make such videos and make a living of it intstead of doing some 'shitty job'. I doubt it would be possible under socialism, likewise Barnett Newman's paintings couldn't be sold for ridiculous amounts of money or any paintings in general, the art market and industry would have be to controlled in some strict ways.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I have spent my childhood in the forests that are also the mass graves for the hundreds of thousands of Jews due to the Nazis. My own people suffered genocide under the soviets, due to deportations to Syberia, which ended in thousands of deaths. Including some of my family. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I likely should try to differentiate communism in theory from communism in practice (Soviet terror). But it's fucking hard. I'll take capitalism any day.

"I don't think it is a difficult problem. Capitalism has to be made to enforce their supposed values. If you put some effort, checks and balances into the system, and if you optimize it to maintain physical and spiritual well being on a good level for all people... it works.   This is what you want from any system, socialist or capitalist. Whatever goal you prioritize before human well being, be it profits, war, maintaining control, etc., people will suffer in ANY system. Just like people suffer in socialist systems that prioritize those things in front of their people.   The solution is in changing the focus, not necessarily the way to get there. The problem is not the idea of free market and globalization. The problem is people caring more about something than the good of society.   The US is a nation of... let's call it 'aggressive foreign politics'. It is pretty clear that the nation prioritizes warfare over welfare. A socialist movement would likely keep it that way, and then you have a socialist military power that doesn't care about it's people.   <3 u","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Amazing video, also good to note how well art galleries hide wealth @10m39s in the video. The value of a lot of art is purely determined by how well it hides wealth, especially when some pieces start getting such ridiculously inflated values, one has to wonder how & why that works. My personal take is that a lot of art is basically at the whims of capitalism and there's an insanely strong lobby of spoiled rich kids who enjoyed a particularly bourgie level education that then jump through the most bizarre mental gymnastics to instill a weird intellectual value on art pieces that are blatantly mocking their attempts of hyper intellectualizing art. None of which will dissuade an entire industry that lives by the optics of all this being amazingly deep works of intrigue and mystery when often the best artists are hidden away from mainstream view only those art pieces so empty and devoid of meaning that the bourgie liberal can hyper intellectualize the artistic equivalent of a wet fart into being worth several millions of dollars, because well he's got the credentials and the authority (from the massive amount of money he can hide for capital) I mean all of HIS/HER pieces are worth several millions. And thus expression gets stifled in those ways too.  #nationaliseart #downwithcopyright #fuckyourtaxevasion","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"The scariest problem with capitalism is that it constructs the social environment unconsciously and because of that it influences our worldview unconsciously. So it's a primitive system being used by an unknowingly primitive species.  Our brains basically absorb the narratives that appeal to our cognitive biases and transform them into our own presuppositions of the world. Since our brains stopped evolving thousands of years ago, an appealing worldview tends not be a coherent worldview.  Capitalism and democracy main premise is that it rewards the narratives and commodities that appeal to the biases of the populations with money/votes. The more money and votes an individual has the more power to construct the social environment. (A cleaner, a secretary, a house that I use during the holidays, a hobbie, etc...).  So we're all collectively stuck in a cycle. That's why history seems to repeat itself.   If a movement arises that exposed and made accessible those dynamics (how we react to authority, how we infuse shapes with an essence, how we tend to only have the past as a reference, plus all the 175 cognitive biases), we could have a chance at turning capitalism obsolete by putting the responsibility to construct the social environment onto the people. (no authority bias = no armies, no essentialist bias = no religion, no countries, and so on...).  imo this is the only way possible to ensure that a coherent revolution won't be appropriated by a more appealing narrative, it also allows for our worldviews to align by destroying total ideological certainty.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"How about democratic technocratic socialism? Capitalism still it exists in some capacity but only for the things that you shat on saying they don't matter. All the base ingredients are still priced however if production is efficient the price lowers to the point of basically being free or actually being free. No more fixed prices. Countries separated into self sufficient zones where all needs are met using the most efficient work plans and systems. Politicians are mandated to have a degree in a stem subject and the higher the degree the more spending budget they get for their campaign trails. Work will be done so the maximum amount of efficiency is met. Profit isn't prioritised, efficiency is. Thinks like healthcare, social care, utilities and education are all free. This system effectively makes capitalism a tool for humanity rather than its own thing with its own whims. This system if done properly will be quite a good thing for the modern world. Although the thing about this system is. It needs common support and it can only be reformed into from another type of viable government. There is no revolution then smash into technocracy. Its inefficient and something against the core ideals of technocracy.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
