Though a feminist criticising bad feminism would always have to finish with what they view a good version of the feminism they were critiquing would be.

"A lot of the psycho advice you mention is actually just teaching normal, assertive, and boundary setting behavior. The point is that women are seen as angry or crazy whenever they stand up for themselves, get mildly emotional, and say no. It's actually kind of ignorant  to say you like women they way they are when we generally act the way we do to avoid facing, in a lot if cases violent, misogyny. While 'take what you want when you want' is actually creepy ass advice, the majority of enabling that your average feminists do are behaviors that everyone should be practicing to live healthy, happy, and safe lives. Like not apologizing for your existence nor letting people harass you just to save their face. If we normalize women doing those things then they'll seem a lot less crazy to antifeminists eventually.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Finally someone that sees my point of view. I agree 100%!!! Yes. Feminism has gone from believing in equality of the sexes and that understand equality doesn't mean the exact same, and went to this misogynist attitude that u must be exactly like a man to be equal instead of appreciating the beauty in femininity, and that masculinity is sometimes a weakness (like violence or unwarranted aggression), not a strength that women need to emulate, and ofc not all masculinity is toxic masculinity, and not all men are bad. Also accepting Islam ideology which often oppresses the LGBT, and women, is quite contradictory to feminism. (Not to say all muslims are bad, as not all take their religion seriously, view it in the same way, or practice it, but rather to say the ideology is bad, Muslim countries are oppressive, and to pretend it's not like many 'feminist' do is anti-feminist as well as anti LGBT.) I notice all movements seem to go this way, like many businesses, and many subcultures, and many other things. They start out w/ a pure cause, where they really stand for something, then once they're popular become corrupted, the very tribalism they were fighting against often envelopes them, and their ideas become mixed up and convoluted. Real feminism is good, and necessary but pop feminism is phoney, contradictory, and in alot of ways, both misogynist, and misandrist at the same time.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Like Dove who pretend to be all for that confidence in the countries where that sells while all in for the skin bleaching in the countries where that sells.  Still, I wouldn't deem all new age feminism to be bullshit shit out by twisted companies. I think now we are making progress within intersectionality for example, and also the MeeToo movement uncovering sexual harassment everywhere. And of course, I know I know , globally we have along way to go. And the constant focus on white rich womens issues is not really bringing help where it is most needed.

"Huh... a contrapoints vid that I actually don't agree with (at least not fully), I think that women should be able to challenge feminine stereotypes even if they are being perceived as being more 'masculine'. Because only then will people be able to see that gender stereotypes begin to lose their power, however women can be perceived as acting more 'masculine' without being complacent to a culture that is founded on toxic masculinity. As for Taylor Swift, look getting mad at a pop star's Grammy speech is to me stupid and trite, we shouldn't be asking why is Taylor congratulating herself for being the first woman to win album of the year, what we should be asking is why it take so long for woman to win Grammy for album of the year. When it comes to celebrities congratulating themselves for their success, it will always be perceived as a self-serving lecture whether it's a white woman being first female artist to win Grammy or a person of color being the first African-American actor/actress to win an Oscar. It's important to remember that their success doesn't exist in vacuum and it can pave the way for more representation of women and people of color.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Women have taken at times, roles more in the background but that doesn't mean they weren't absolutely essential.

Do not remove the Aeon counter code.Content       Light pollution is often characterised as a soft issue in  environmentalism. This perception needs to change. Light at night  constitutes a massive assault on the ecology of the planet, including us. It also has indirect impacts because, while 20 per cent of electricity is used for lighting worldwide, at least 30 per cent  of that light is wasted. Wasted light serves no purpose at all, and  excessive lighting is too often used beyond what is needed for driving,  or shopping, or Friday-night football. The electric light bulb is  touted as one of the most significant technological advancements of  human beings. It ranks right up there with the wheel, control of fire,  antibiotics and dynamite. But as with any new and spectacular  technology, there are invariably unintended consequences. With electric  light has come an obliteration of night in much of the modern world;  both outside in the city, and indoors during what was once 'night'  according to the natural position of the Sun.Life has evolved for  several billion years with a reliable cycle of bright light from the  Sun during the day, and darkness at night. This has led to the  development of an innate circadian rhythm in our physiology; that  circadian rhythm depends on the solar cycle of night and day to maintain  its precision. During the night, beginning at about sunset, body  temperature drops, metabolism slows, hunger abates, sleepiness  increases, and the hormone melatonin rises dramatically in the blood.  This natural physiological transition to night is of ancient origin, and  melatonin is crucial for the transition to proceed as it should.We  now know that bright, short-wavelength light - blue light - is the most  efficient for suppressing melatonin and delaying transition to  night-time physiology; meanwhile, dimmer, longer-wavelength light -  yellow, orange, and red, from a campfire or a candle, for example - has  very little effect. Bright light from the Sun contains blue light, which  is a benefit in the morning when we need to be alert and awake; but  whether we are outdoors or indoors, when bright, blue light comes after  sunset, it fools the body into thinking it's daytime.I expressed  the first serious concern about the potential health consequences of  electric light at night 30 years ago, when I asked whether over-lighting  might increase the risk of breast cancer.  It was during the 1980s, just as researchers were finding that a fatty  Western diet might not much alter the breast-cancer risk in individuals,  that a friend from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in  Seattle pointed me to research on the impact of melatonin. Lowered  levels of melatonin (an effect of over-lighting) had been traced to  heightened levels of oestrogen (at least in rodents), a clear  breast-cancer risk factor when fatty diets were not. Later evidence has shown that women who work the night shift are at higher breast-cancer risk. Evidence suggests  that circadian disruption from over-lighting the night could be related  to risk of obesity and depression as well. In fact, it might be that  virtually all aspects of health and wellbeing are dependent to one  extent or another on a synchronised circadian rhythmicity, with a  natural cycle of bright days and dark nights.Putting a finer point on the risk is 'The New World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness', published  in 2016. The atlas uses data from NASA's Suomi National Polar-orbiting  Partnership satellite to estimate skyglow across the globe. The images  in the atlas are either dazzling or horrifying, depending on how you  look at it. In its coloured maps of cities and countries, using brighter  colours to show greater skyglow, Europe and North America appear  ablaze. According to the atlas, the Milky Way cannot be seen at night by  one-third of humans. In Europe, it's not visible to 60 per cent of  people, and in North America, it's a whopping 80 per cent.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think i disagree with your turning women into men thing.  Its more about how women can have traits associated with men,  and that certain attitudes who are seen as positive in men should also be seen as positive in women.  For example many women are uncompromising but are told this is a negative in a woman but a positive in a man.  And there are certain circles of feminism that ask why?  Why should it be a negative trait for women to take initiative, while its a positive for men.  I feel like its the equivalent of getting the idea that women can work in all the jobs men work socialy accepted.  Its trying to get the idea that men can be leaders uncompromising ruthless etc socially accepted.  In my mind its just people trying to destroy gender roles","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"3:47 , I couldnt agree more Contra! Some feminist really do seem to resent femininity. I dont want to become more manly, I like being feminine. Which has been my biggest reason to not call myself a feminist over the years, and even at times resenting feminism. If you want to have children and stay at home with them, care for your husband, be in a traditionally female job, you are seen as some feminist as weak and part of the patriarchy etc. You have internalized misogyny they will say. I constantly get asked why I (who had good grades in school) became 'just a nurse'. Like that is not something to be valued, like taking care of and nurturing people isn't as valuable as making lots of money or something (like engineers, doctors, lawyers etc do, granted a lot more women have become doctors now it was to begin with only males who did it).   I still don't call myself a feminist for that very reason, although I do realize there are many feminists out there that do not think this way.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"People probably won't read this, and it will probably sound like I am whining, but I will post it anyways, because I am hoping to get some advice and I need to get it off my chest. I was commenting on this person's post about their generalization and pointed out that their statement was counterproductive to what they wanted to achieve. They responded to my post by ridiculing me and saying that I did not understand.  This resulted in a few back and forth posts until this person blocked me and then made a post calling me a false ally to Feminism and said that I was trying to make Feminism about me. I feel that she is being extremely childish about the whole thing, but I cannot get it out of my mind. This person feels like they are the stereotype of what people think Feminism is, but I don't want to leave the situation as is, but I feel that if I do continue it, it just gives this person more power.  Basically, I want to ask people what they think I should do. Yes this is a bad place to ask about it, and I probably sound like I am a special snowflake who got my feelings hurt, but I am genuinely confused as to what to do. I want to stop thinking about it, but my mind is fixating on this and it won't let go. Again I know I sound pathetic, but am just hoping for some way to find some closure. Sorry if you hate me for this post, but I understand. No one wants to deal with another person's problems.

"Ryan Adams of Whiskeytown did a whole album cover of Taylor Swift's 1989 and I think that's the closest we'll get to Dylan singing about Jake Gyllenhaal being a vinyl hipster, other than your version, obviously. Sidenote: Taylor is a cold blooded, calculated, filthy capitalist born to a 4th generation banking family worth hundreds of millions who makes even more millions by ruthless control and maintenance of her ginned up image as some Tennessee girl next door.   This article about the whole charade is pretty fascinating: URL  Also, does anyone remember the series on Current TV (around 2008ish?) where Sarah Haskins satirized commercials featuring women and products for women and the stereotypes of women that they present? I believe it was called 'Target Women'. Her style is similar to your snark and humor, but, IMO your production value, creativity, and talent actually surpass hers and she had a whole team of people and that Al Gore/Current TV money.

"Funny enough, more and more men are starting to come to the conclusion that those man-hating trans-exclusionary radical feminists (who are somehow almost all white) aren't actually so bad because at least they hate trans people, especially trans women, with a burning passion too. And the radfems find that their new unlikely allies, woman-hating men, are kind of peachy. Because at least they're not trans women, who are literally worse than cis men. The new opponent for both are those trans-accepting and trans-enabling (trans- and sex-positive) SJW 'fun feminists', who are now somehow overly hedonist and not political enough, while yesterday, when Obama was still our overlord, they were still 'stop having fun guys' and too political, and they kind of still are. Because fuck logic lol.  There's nothing like feminists who are actually somehow really into reactionary patriarchal thinking about gender and other things.

"Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down there. I agree that 95% of everything is shit, but you used Caligula as an example of one of innumerable shitty movies. As a decent film critic and slightly below-average director of shitty little short films that I never want anyone to see, I take offense to that. Caligula is a really great movie. Yes, it's extremely uncomfortable to watch, but then again so is Salo: the 120 Days of Sodom. Actually, Salo is like a million times worse! I actually vomited during it and I'm the type of person who watches Eraserhead and enjoys the experience (it's an amazing movie, but it's also intentionally abrasive, diseased, strange, off-putting, terrifying and uses ludonarrative synchronization masterfully; but due to our protagonist's life the sound design makes me want to dig out my eardrums in the best possible way). I assume you think it's shit due to the way it reflected the eponymous character's moral degradation and lack of compassion as he learns to just let sex (both consensual and non-consensual) and violence rule his city. Yes it's deeply disturbing, but it also really makes you feel like one of his advisors watching helplessly as the city is enveloped in Caligula's anarchic, depraved and aggressive rule. If you think it's shit for some other reason, I'd love to talk about it. I try to never miss a conversation about film with someone with a mind who can understand the art behind it. Who knows, maybe you'll even spread your philistinism to me (facetious of course, I really respect your opinion and enjoy your content).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Zomg it's almost like there's Capitalistic Feminism, and Socialistic Feminism. I think the idea that laziness is inherently bad should be unpacked. Most people I know when they're being 'lazy', they're really just exhausted and need a rest, or less hours at work, or a vacation, and once they've rested they're itching to go again. Or someone's job might be unfulfilling and repetitive (soon to be replaced by robots), and their brain is just not engaged. And the cornerstone of the 8 hour work week is being overturned and reversed by tech companies and law firms that much their employees to work 50, 60, or 70 hour weeks. The distinction is similar to that of self-respect and arrogance, where is the line? There isn't any, or depends where you're standing. I think laziness should be celebrated, even mandatory.

Besides society being more generous towards lazy, ugly, psychotic men than women with similar traits,  Korea  or other countries does seem to go even further. Korean tv programs portray lazy, ugly and stupid men as innocent, safe(since he's so unpopular he wont exploit you like so-called relatively attractive 'bad guys'.Which is very far from true.)and as someone who has this freesoul that  any societal obligation cannot bridle this wild, unworldly creature.(But then why would these guys become extremly conservative when it comes to issues like sharing household chores?),thereby enforcing the message that a 'well-adjusted'girls would find even these guys somewhat cute and attractive.Not only  that, men who constantly look down on minorities and abuse animals say that women should love animals/children. In this context I would proudly shout out 'Good girls go to heaven and bad girls everywhere'.

"I don't know. There's a lot I disagree with in this video, CP. Isn't there a difference between shaming and constructive criticism? I wouldn't think shaming is productive over trivial matters like getting your makeup applied in standard fashion. And isn't it too essentialist to ascribe commanding and dominating attitudes to masculine? Additionally, isn't it just a difference of opinion as to whether promoting those traits in people is useful? Anecdotally, from my perspective there does seem to be some correlation between being aggressive and being successful. I don't know whether such behavior is typically ethical, though. However, that likely depends on what ethical system you subscribe to and what is really meant by being aggressive.   Which brings me to my next question: although you may have been joking, but assuming you weren't, does the idea of 'not taking no for an answer' (among other things you mentioned in that segment) mean to those giving that advice what you take it to mean here? I just don't think that's what is meant. Your interpretation seems uncharitable.   Lastly, although I don't know if Taylor Swift is breaking glass ceilings in the music industry considering the fact that there are many successful award-winning female artists in the music industry, how does pointing out the oppressed status of anyone else take away from that achievement if she was? How does the status of people who have it worse demand that more privileged women not boast about their achievements or point out problems that concern them? Isn't that a fallacy of relative privation? I was under the impression that the intersectionality of feminism meant giving consideration to those of various backgrounds including the typical, privileged, middle-class white woman, not to the disparagement and exclusion of white women who have it better.  I don't know. Maybe I'm one of those feminist you would strongly disagree with, or maybe I misunderstand you. Nonetheless, although I acknowledge problems in any basic belief or, what's more, any complicated ideology adopted by 'casuals' like myself (because after all, most people either aren't that smart or aren't going to research too far into the ideology like an academic such as yourself will), I want to say that I'm not sure if it's worth bemoaning. After all, as I said, it's inevitable. As an idea spreads, 'stupid people' and the half-hearted are bound to make up the demographics of those promoting it at some point. Look at the bulk of atheists and theists, both of whom make terrible arguments supporting their beliefs, and many of whom aren't trained to appreciate, explain, or understand the science they sometimes cite. Liberals and conservatives too, as well as anarchists and libertarians, all have the 'casual base' that will have a limited understanding of what they propose. Yes, criticize them should they go overboard in ways like leaving shit posts on someone's Twitter or YouTube video, but other than that, what else is there to do?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The reason why feminism is eating in on itself is because a lot of the people who want in on it don't fully understand it. There are multiple kinds of feminism but the one that is portrayed in particular in mainstream discourse is the kind that seeksnout 'superior' traits in 'femininity'. I think the more healthy kind of feminism is to attack and dismantle the idea of gender norms and to suggest women have systematically been oppressed as a result of these fictions. 'Masculinity' and 'femininity' should both not be promoted and the mainstream kind of feminism that we hear a lot creates the basis that makes it easy for reactionarries to sink their claws into 'feminism', and thus making it seem like feminism has been dismantled as a whole.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think the problem is that the lesson taught by feminism has always been about changing women to be like men.  And there's something to this: for a long time, the person sorting traits into 'masculine' and 'feminism' was a guy.  Like, 'has to spends years of their life looking perfect' er.... woman! 'Gets compliments for doing his job adequately?' men!   So yeah 'pop' feminism is not perfect today and I COMPLETELY agree with your points about the commercialization about feminism.  Yeah even among the things that you said you thought were garbage have some positivist.  Taylor Swift may be a hacktivist taking advantage of the movement, but if some girls listen to her 'girl power' anthems and genuinely believes that women are good, instead of like me growing up hearing 90% of popular music about how all women are awful people, then, there's some good to that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It no longer needs a definition, because now it has a description.

I don't usually use labels that associate me with a movement I consider 95% absolute shit so it confuses me that you adopt it. And feminism was always supposed to be a movement that represents Egalitarian ideology specific to women as an oppressed class  - not the ideology itself. Women are no longer oppressed, so all of these little social nuances should be separated from this oppressed victim narrative which is ironically distracting from the issues by creating a sort of gender/race war.

"I think you should reconsider the premise of criticizing your own side of the fence.  Criticism within a feminist framework could really help start actually defining what the True Scottish Feminist actually is. It's one thing to swing away at 'the patriarchy', but even the TERF & SWERF overtly bigoted political lesbians do that. The anti-fem side of the fence tends to categorize into fairly self-explanatory groups that all tend to have independent motivations for their general opposition towards feminism as a whole (eg: MRAs vs MGTOWs vs PUAs). Where as feminism seems comfortable in being this nebulous apparent monolith where no individual component seems to feel any need to brand themselves as anything more specific than 'feminist'. So... to criticize it, we have to either invent a new word to try and describe it, or attack the monolith.  I'm kinda intrigued to know where the limit is. At what point 'reverse' sexism is 'harmless' or 'understandable' and at what point it becomes worth fighting just like any other feminist cause.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Even if the assumption that a group's viewpoints will mature and gain nuance with age is historically valid, that doesn't necessarily mean that a '49 year old man's' assessment of the situation is invalid. Regardless of the creep factor, much of their criticisms are also aimed at older, mass-marketed people and organizations that hold equally 'youthful' or 'marketable' stances on certain issues. In the end, I think this push-back (which, as someone who watches a handful of the folks that you're taking shots at, is admittedly guilty of blowing some trends or scandals out of proportion) is a necessary element in refining the newest ideological developments into rounded adult mindsets for the future.

"Loved the video. Though I will say that, even though I don't identify as a feminist, it's hard to disagree with it's foundation. I remember when we read Simone de Beauvoir in university, I didn't find it very difficult to agree with her philosophical statements, such as the fact that a naturalistic argument can't be used to justify oppression of one group by another(such as women being on average physically weaker than men, meaning then that they are inferior by definition, and shouldn't be able to do what they want for example), which is absolutely true that it can't.  While I somewhat agree with you that there's more people speaking out against the retarded parts of the ideology on the internet, I still feel like it's socially unacceptable in the more public arenas of life to have reservations against modern feminism. I can't tell you how many times I've personally experienced people conflating my criticism of feminism with actual hatred of women, and this is true of literally any ideology frankly, it happens when I criticize Islam as well for being theocratic and imperialistic; people assume I am talking about Habib working an Uber, and that I hate his brown skin(Even though this is a complete non-sequitur, as Islam is a religion that is multi-ethnic).  I mean, everyone has some ideological narrative in their head in some way or another, but it seems to me that some people are vastly more emotionally invested than others, and it really stifles honest debate.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

So wouldn't the women and minorities who are especially talented, hard working, or conscientious* rising to the top, and useless lazy twats of both genders and all backgrounds sinking to the bottom be exactly what these movements are hoping to see?  *Whether Taylor Swift represents an actual example of this, will be left as an exercise for the reader.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I was glad to see the title 'Pop Feminism' because that's exactly the phrase I used in one of my videos: it does seem to be a very useful label. However, I would say that this type of feminism is not so much a distraction as it is mainstream: it's these types of claims and complaints that currently have the most clout in politics, colleges, and daily interactions.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Another interesting video, Contra! I'm a little iffy on your interpretations of ban bossy and stuff like that because I think at least the idea behind it is to go against the aspects of our society that close out and/or unfairly limit women. It's not saying that women should be more like men but instead that if women want to be in the competitive business world that we should stop with the internally sexist thinking that keeps them out of it. The operative word being want. Not every woman wants to be a CEO but for those who do, it's imperative that sexist thinking be eliminated so that they can be taken seriously and judged on their merits as a businessperson.  The way you read the ban bossy campaign I feel was a bit shallow and you only touched on aspects like the corporatization of feminism that I think are much more damaging to the movement and ironically even though I just spent the last paragraph defending ban bossy, it's emblematic of that corporatization.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It's a wonderful film about love, loyalty and family.   It also stars Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, *Sir* John Gielgud and Peter Fuckin' O'Toole.  How can anyone not love Peter Fuckin' O'Toole?  Plus it was written by Gore Vidal! How could a movie with that kind of talent be anything but great?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I respectfully disagree. A lot of this video gives off the vibe of desperately needing to read over one of my favorite feminist comics; URL I'm always wary of the IAFB statements that feminism is good but certain feminist causes are just juvenile bullshit (usually a degradation of Tumblr is invoked) because it's a very non-intersectional way to approach a feminist cause. We all have our privilege blind spots; we all lack lived experiences others have had with a certain problems; who is anyone to arbitrate which feminist causes are 'the important ones'? This is especially true with your reference to Ban Bossy. In a perfect world, bossy would exclusively mean someone who is inflexible and inconsiderate of anyone else's needs or opinions and this trait would be universally and equally maligned amongst anyone of any demographic. But I constantly hear from women in management positions that they are criticized for being 'bossy' even when displaying less dominance than their white male counterparts, essentially just because their subordinates are uncomfortable being told what to do by someone they hold privilege over. I agree part of feminism is making the workplace more accommodating to femininity, but advocating ONLY doing this ignores women that chose to be more masculine in the workplace of their own volition. Or women like me who have stereotypically male attributes like assertiveness but consider those traits incidental or even a facet of their genders. I intend to be a boss; wouldn't it be a problem if the people who are supposed to listen to me undermine my authority by using language that implies me doing my job is a bad thing? How my gender impacts my effectiveness at a specific position seems like a pretty important feminist issue to me.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"its not random feminists.. its feminist leaders saying and doing bigoted things. Men sure as hell didnt pass a man spreading law that resulted in thousands of arrests.

"*Fab.* The only thing I have a minor scuffle is the bossy thing.  From my own experience at least, I would argue they've got a point - assertive women are often branded as being rude/bitchy/bossy when they speak up for themselves.  The comments about women in leadership roles often relate back to some flaw in their personality, and sometimes therefore they are often taken less seriously, possibly having damaging consequences career-prospects wise.  However, we should be advertising the fight against gender stereotypes as 'don't consider  women bossy if you would't consider it the same for a man', rather than reclaiming it as if a dislikeable personality is something we should aspire to.  But that's just me out in the sun with my pseudo-intellectual magnifying glass frying up minor and irrelevant points like ants.  *Great video.

"I like this video, but here's the thing:  your argument that everything is shit is a bit weak. The movements that I associate with have leaders that make active efforts to improve, listen to opposing arguments, and generally not be terrible. More importantly, as much as people might rag on the highest-grossing movies, I actually like a lot of them, and the same goes for most of the stuff you mentioned, including highly-subscribed youtubers.  The key here is that your leaders - not 95% of your movement, but your leaders - are shit. The tweet you quote comes from an account with 644K followers, and as I scrolled down the timeline to see user engagement I saw more likes on every single tweet than views on your video (and minimum retweets X3 your upvotes). Let's not even get into 644k versus 5452 subs...  Face it, the leaders of your movement in the media, in the press, and in government, as well as celebrity leaders, are all what you would describe as shit. Moreover, they're using the movement to push all kinds of bad laws, bad policy, and anti-male sentiment all over the place. So why stay in the movement, continue to legitimize it, and defend it? Sure, not all feminists are fat man-haters, but the ones that are are extremely powerful in the movement and get a lot of media play, while also pushing all kinds of ideas about 'fat-shaming' and 'body-shaming' directly into the national consciousness.   So what is your response to that? If I thought that my leaders were terrible, I'd leave my movement even though I agreed with a lot of the principles. And while I don't fully agree with everything they do or think they're 100% non-shady, I do think they're pretty solid and more importantly, as my goal in this movement is to push back against SJW regressivism, I think that they do a great job of that. The quoted goal of feminism is -equality- (though maybe you've got your own personal definition?) and yet your leaders work directly against that by attacking men and men's rights. So do you not want equality or some type of equivalent system? Do you just want women to gain more rights, despite them arguably having advantages over men in a ton of ways in our modern society? What's the point of sticking with such an incredibly toxic and unwilling to listen or change type of movement?   (p.s.: I actually really do enjoy it though. You've got a good style. I don't think the jokes land 100% but I don't think they're meant to either, a lot more fun than funny)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Something I heard a more thoughtful anti-feminist say is that anyone can call themselves a feminist. I think this is a very valid point. It's an ideology, but one that covers such a broad range of ideas. The dictionary definition of feminism is 'the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men.' In theory nearly everyone agrees with this idea, but there are such differing opinions about what equality entails. It just so happens that the feminism that is most visible is the pop-culture oriented, liberal bourgeois kind that appeals to the 1st world middle class millennial demographic.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

They make it look like it's so easy, so un-radical, just to have more people on their side.
