"Political videos tend not to be interpreted very charitably (I know this video is going to be upheld by centrists as evidence I've 'gone full Antifa' and by leftists that I'm a closet centrist) so I'd better state unambiguously what I think.  The character Tabby represents a lot of what I think is wrong about leftist strategy: the indifference to optics, the undisguised hostility to the ideologically impure, the sectarian nitpicking, the alternation between extreme optimism ('a communist revolution can happen in the United States and it will go well if it does') and extreme pessimism ('neoliberal propaganda has so tight a grip on the general public that why should we even bother trying to appeal to them?'), the blurring of lines between recognizing the necessity of violence in certain situations and the aesthetic celebration of violence as an end in itself. Nevertheless I try to represent Tabby with some sympathy, and anticipate that my viewers will like her--my audience is at least 95% trans Antifa cat girls, but I hope that doesn't prevent them from thinking about the critique.  The character Justine is a mouthpiece for a lot of my complaints about the left, and the recipient of some leftist criticisms of me ('you go to brunch with these people?'), but I chose not to represent her as an attractive alternative. She's complacent, frivolous, and ineffective, full of derision for the way other leftists do things but not contributing much for her own part either. When a fascist comes knocking on the door it's better to have Tabby there than Justine. To see if Justine can put her money where her mouth is we'd have to see what speech she delivers following the fascist speech. This YouTube channel is effectively my attempt to make that speech, and I can't be the one who judges how successful it is.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I know I'm fairly late to comment, but I think part of what holds the left back is that centrists/moderates and especially those on the far right see violence as justifiable or even non-violent when done by the state. I was talking with a friend who said he hadn't considered police arresting people and courts incarcerating them as violent actions. When I proposed that they were, he tepidly agreed but said my viewpoint was cynical. Thinking about this video and my experiences, it really is an uphill battle helping largely unmotivated people drill through their own social conditioning. The solution is to motivate them to do the work themselves. It's the only way to bring change non-violently.  This is coming from someone who is fairly new to the left. I'm still unsure about where I stand exactly within the left and how to best communicate/advocate ideas that are still somewhat new to me","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I never heard a person from the right say that another person is not 'something' enough. They are more welcoming than the left, it's a winning strategy. They are supposed to be horrible xenophobes or racists, yet black people can run for the republicans. When I was a teenager, I got really interested by the Punk movement but rapidly understood I could never fit the mold for various reasons but the first one is being fat. Did you ever notice that fat punks don't exist nor big punk clothes? It is problematic that leftist movements that are supposed to be anti-establishment are like ultra private clubs with strict rules about behavior and apearance. It's not just the intellectual elite that does that, it can be a group of crusty squatters. There are Straight Edge punks that are against taking any drug. The idea is that you have to have a clear mind, free of distraction to see reality as it is and combat it's evils. A good idea in theory, but what happens if you become physically or mentally sick? And there are other hippie-like groups that think if you don't do all the drugs especially psychedelics you can't have an open mind and see reality as it really is. There is also infinite conflicts inside ideologies like the famous Marxist-Leninist/Trotskyst clash. It is totally okay to debate and question things but dividing incessantly can be counter productive.

I'm not concerned about looking good to people who think I don't exist anyway.these ideas will always look good to the people who really understand them, regardless of how angry the packaging is.

"I don't know if this is as important  an idea to bring to the table (and I know that asking for a reasoned debate in YouTube comments is an exercise in futility), but I feel like another problem with the Left's idea of activism, especially Tabby's brand of it, is that it doesn't leave anything for the people who *can't* go out and 'meaningfully' protest by punching Nazis or laying down on the tarmac.  People with chronic or mental illnesses.  People with physical disabilities.  People who can't afford to lose their jobs because they have a family to feed.  People in poverty.  People with pre-existing trauma having to do with police and riots and the like.  What are they supposed to do?  Does their inability to 'meaningfully' protest make them just as bad as the people they hate?  How 'useful' would they be to their cause if they'd be the first people gunned down or driven into homelessness?  We need to give the people who can't afford to go out and be Big Bad Fash-Smashers a place at the table, or we risk alienating them just as much as the system already does.  I've always been of the opinion that people are a lot more valuable when they're actually *alive* to bring about change, so advocating for them to run out and put themselves in harm's way--or else they're just a sheep content to Just Follow Orders--maybe isn't the best course of action. TL;DR--It's good that we have people like Tabby, but not everyone, given their circumstances, is *able* to be Tabby, and we can't dismiss them out of hand.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"To let people know in advance, I am trans. I agree with you that how something is said seems to matter more than how much substance what was just said contains. This is why Trump won the election. His emotionally charged speeches roused people into voting for him without thinking about the consequences or if what he had just promised was even possible. Emotional people are easily led. On the other hand if the left begins to use the same practices are they any better? Do two wrongs make a right? If you put a leftist in office using the same tactics Trump did would this person even be an effective leader? What I'm about to say may get me crucified but I am about to say it anyway. The right, even the alt-right are not evil people. I disagree with them on every level but I do not consider them my enemy. The best way to end hostility is to remain calm, rational and engage your opponent with a level head and compassion for what may have brought them to their current state of thinking. They are not the enemy. They are simply people with a different world view and if you wish to change their view showing them that you understand that they are human beings capable of love, kindness an understanding just as you are is the best way to do it. Going to war with the alt-right will not change anything. It will only cause more people to join the alt-right. Love your enemies and you will have none.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I agree that that the left needs to work on it's rhetoric and it's 'brand', but in this video you are continuing the trend of talking about leftism and the left in a way that is contrived to fit your narrative and service your argument, instead of presenting actual evidence. Your are essentially robbing leftists of their voice, which is a basic problem for the promotion of their ideas, far outweighing the bad optics generated by some bad apples on social media, which tends to bring out the worst in people, and then this bad press is amplified by a complicit media. I used to consider myself a libertarian, but leftist speech that has a commitment to the truth and moral rightness literally convinced me to think of myself as a socialist. So this argument rings hollow for me. The left may have issues, but the individualist explanation you advance for it here is a weak one. For every uninspiring leftist you cite I can name five. And cool is totally and completely subjective. Come on, you can do better.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Assaulting for having what you consider undesirable opinions is not a just means with 'bad optics' it is highly immoral and illegal. When you claim that punching 'Nazi's' is justified because you are stopping future oppression and violence against marginalized groups it comes off as extremely self-righteous and deluded. Assaulting anyone for any reason other than immediate defense of your or someone else's life, liberty or property will never be justified. Also it doesn't help that typical Antifa members label anyone who is pro-life or against forced diversity as a 'Nazi'.  Congratulations, you have successfully rationalized assaulting people you disagree with and somehow they are the authoritarian closed minded ones. Imagine if someone assaulted you. You'd be like 'Dude WTF, I'm calling police'. But then the assaulter said 'No, I can punch you because I have thought about it a lot and your harmful ideas will lead to violence and oppression against me sometime in the future.'

"I know this is ancient and probably said before, but that move to F2 at 2:30 is illegal. You can't move your king into a space adjacent to the opponent's king because it would imperil your king, which you can't do.

"As an activist on the left, I have mixed feelings about this.  On one hand, I agree that it's important if the left wants to reach other people, and not just cheer amongst themselves, then we do need to be aware of the delivery of our message and that not everyone is going to be down with the WHO'S STREETS? OUR STREETS!!! chants. I think we need multiple methods of delivery because there isn't one style of delivery that is going to reach all people. My mother for example, often responds to protests with 'eh, why are they yelling?' as she doesn't care for people yelling lol and she will not stop to ask why they are doing so.  I think it's important that as activists that we recognize the difference between the tactic that feels cathartic and a tactic is actually effective. Catharsis does not always = effective and it's vital that we are mindful of the difference.  That said, not everyone on the left is antifa and that needs to be noted. I also think antifa is very important, especially in these times. When the fascists come ready to smash and intimidate, the left needs it's own security force of sorts and that's where the antifa comes in. Think of what happened in Charlottesville where a group of academic scholars and religious community leaders, linked arms and started singing this little light of mine in protest. If not for the antifa, they would have gotten their asses kicked.  I also think while ideally people can sit down and have a constructive conversation about issues, I don't think it's realistic or in many cases fair to ask that of people in marginalized demographics to calmly explain why tbey should not oppressed - or how they even are oppressed, for that is often up for debate, for the 1,000th this week. When people are getting daily doses of social and systemic oppression, it's draining. It's a bit like saying 'oh, are you utterly drained by the social and systmic oppression that you face on a daily basis? explain to me - prove to me - how this is true, but do in a cool, calm manner, so not to offend my delicate ears.'   (or the people who are not oppressed, and treat other people's oppression as their intellectual exercise by playing devil's advocate - I'm kinda down with Tabby (hypothetically? lol) smashing those people ha ha ;) )   This is not to be confused with the faux-ally who gets off on calling people out in a non-constructive away and the drama of it all.   anyway before this turns into a full on essay, I shall end this comment here lol. As always I appreciate the use of theater and creativity to discuss this issue (as that is one tactic that I do beleive is effective and enjoyable) and thanks for creating these videos.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"At first I was a bit harsh on this video but I see now why it's important that it was made. I see a lot of the ways Marxist-Leninists talk about human rights and the (campist) way they discuss China/Iran/Hezbollah and so on and so forth. It worries me that they might be the most detrimental thing to communism going forth, as their downright refusal to recognize tactical failings makes them susceptible to the exploitation of those failings. If you think the adventurist anarchists tipping over trash cans and smashing coffee shop windows give the left a bad image, you've never seen a member of the PSL defend Bashar Al-Assad at a protest against US Imperialism. There's more concern with what is materialist than there is for tactics and how to advertise socialism as actually quite a good thing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You absolutely hit the nail on the head saying that the left should be more cool.  I always thought of leftism as the only way until I went to college. I grew up in a very working class neighbourhood and got to college through saving money. Leftism is made for academic arts students who don't know what it's like to have to work just to survive. So they stick to theory and won't compromise their values. It makes them come off as rigid and self-involved, not to mention spiteful and elitist when they're criticised.  I read a few leftist theory books and remarked in college that if more of the non-educated working class understood what they said and knew about the theory in as plain language as it could be, they would be leftists themselves. But they're full of academic jargon that only leftist college kids would realistically read and thoroughly understand. A lot of leftist leaders cater to the middle and upper classes, and they tell the working class what they should want without explaining it in plain English or listening to their ideas/stories.   I try my best to stay with my values as a leftist, but I know that more of us need to be called out on our bs on a more regular basis. I find more classism in the left than the right, which is ironic but also incredibly sad.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It isn't. Class has always existed, but not really as some Hegelian  struggle. Sadly, the fascists are closer to reality; ethnic movement is the great driver of human history.   Add to that that Marx was a terrible human being who didn't pay his bills to his tradesmen, lived off dividends from the Engles family mills, never once even visited those mills,  didn't provide for his family and was as racist as his times we see he actually didn't give a shit about working people.

"Love to see videos like this too! Presentation matters, and if these issues are as important to us as we say, then it should be just as important to us to present them to people in an appealing and comprehensible way if we want people to truly understand their importance and want to support them. Besides, while fighting against people who seem to be all about vitriol and gatekeeping, it's important to me at least to genuinely not be the same negative, angry, vitriolic people as they are. If we're aiming to create togetherness we can't be fighting amongst each other over things like who suffered more, and who's a true paragon of morality and altruism. We need to look at people realistically and not cannibalize people who may have made mistakes in their past, especially if they're turning their lives around and now want to support progressive causes, and not demonize people who support progressive ideals but who also enjoy material wealth or just plain realize they NEED money to be able to put some of their progressive ideas in motion. Nobody's perfect, nobody's an angel or a saint. We're just people trying to shape our world into one where we can be a little happier before we die, so we need to shift this from parsing good and evil and focus more on what goals we need to achieve to create the world we're hoping to live in.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There's a balance between the two. Visually-appealing emotionally-poignant content often surpasses story-driven theory-delving works, to the point that the Slasher and Found Footage genres of horror movies were so financially successful that they saw massive influxes. Only after people have grown bored of their oversaturation in the marketplace do concept-oriented analyses (ergo, deconstructions and decon/recon content) get the chance to be fully appreciated. Hell, even anime...how many people would recognize the protagonists of a Shonen action anime with its emphasis on the spectacle of fighting and powers (Goku from DBZ, Luffy from One Piece, Naruto from Naruto, even Ichigo from Bleach or )  Personally, I've never really cared about how I present myself. I like what I like, I value what I value, and while I can justify my beliefs and actions with logical reflection if desired...since I am me and I am not anyone else, I feel it's fair to not pretend to be someone else or force myself to try and be someone I am not.

"It's not necessarily that anti-SJWs are unpopular or uncool, that's beside the point. The issue is how SJWs have been represented, as being evil. SJWs are made out to be this group of sociopaths that are preying on weaker men to push a women's agenda, and as black people lying about their disenfranchisement. If not that, they're made to seem incorrect in other ways.  For example taking a discussion about race; specifically are black Americans more likely to commit crimes? This is a subject that requires competency and research to establish the truth on, with an immense amount of pressure to report accurately due to the consequences of an erroneous conclusion. If you come to the conclusion that black people tend to commit more crimes, then you are interpreted as a racist rather than merely wrong. And this is also a problem because the person doing it is indeed wise enough to know that their conclusions may also be used by racists to try to justify their own dogma and racist worldviews.  The thing about trying to learn the truth is that it's significantly harder. Truth isn't something that the world just gives to people for free. Especially in statistical analysis, and liars also confound the issues. As now everyone has to take time out of their own lives to spend researching new facts, in order not to be racists, if they even are the kind of people who care if someone calls them racist.  And after a certain point people start to take shortcuts. They decide 'well in the absence of opposition and more and more people reinforcing my viewpoints here, and also in addition to that, only seeing strawmen of the opposition, I might as well accept black people commit more crimes.'  It can take a lot of time to get to the point where you understand why the sentence 'black people commit more crime' doesn't indicate that they should be given more attention by the police. But when you figure it out, it's a magic moment. Of course by that point the amount of time spent defending yourself amidst being labelled has produced a lot of fuck ups.   The bullying that SJWs receive doesn't make them uncool. If anything, digging around in FBI statistics to try discerning whether or not something is true whilst someone berates you constantly by just saying 'Feminists are better than you' isn't a cool way to spend the afternoon.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"For me the important pragmatical leftist goals are: - Universal healthcare - High quality public education - Regulation to fix market deficiencies.  - Not having very excessive inequality - Protection of civil rights. - Protection of the environment - No disfunctional representative system (democracy)  Therefore my conception of ideal state is something like Denmark. I don't see how you can ever convert in Denmark with a revolution. You need to implement incremental changes in the good direction. When people see that those changes are good changes, they support more incremental changes. Scandinavian countries took 80 years (started in the 1930s), and most Western countries 50-60 years (they started in the 1950s). I'm from Spain, Franco died in 1975 so we started later, a reason why we have higher ineqality than most Europe... but man, big change since the 70s!!   I see radical lefts as delusionals and harming left pragmatical positions, as they scare parts of the population. Antifas harms the goals they pretend to defend. Communism and anarchism usually creates more inequality because it fuels right movements and deters incremental change. They don't offer much to pragmatical political discussion (proposals for doable new law in education or healthcare).   Please, contribute to a more leftist USA... abandoning radical positions. Because beating nazis probably is cool, but it's actually damaging the cause. If you actually care the left agenda.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It's the culture that is wrong and bad. I say this as a person who escaped Islamic tyranny. Your intellectual approach to things won't cut with the brute force of their culture.

You will be replaced by people who look like you, the Muslim, who will stop flooding into Europe eventually but the initial injection is enough to start the initial conversion process, and Europe will become Muslim most likely because of the power vacuum that has been left over by the eradication of the preceding classical culture. And you are helping them along... Because you are so smart, and we who escaped this shit, and we who try to reform this shit that you intellectuals of the acedemic making call us fascists and allow without looking at history as to what happened to the Romans in the exact same situation when during Their Roman Peace middle easterners and their Abrahamic ideas started moving in through the empire and infecting it, until it collapsed under the brutal regime of Christians, and other various barbarians.

"Hi I'm going on a ContraPoints binge so here I am.  As someone who is often branded a 'toothless centrist', I really very much enjoyed this video. You showed, really well, why I distanced myself very seriously from the radical left. I stopped glorifying violence, stopped with the guillotine memes, and read up on everything I possibly could so I actually understood where my opposition was coming from. I calmed myself. Made myself 'cool', as you put it here, and, since doing that, I've managed to convince more people of my point of view than I ever could have while shouting 'Punch the Nazis' and verbally berating everyone I deemed as 'ideologically impure.' I've also realized that, in this current climate, compromises are necessary. The possibility of a successful communist revolution with an actually good long-term outcome in the current state of society in the US is, quite honestly, a long-shot. There's not enough support for it, and not enough people who understand what actual communism is, because the only major exposure to it that anyone has had in the last few years were/are absolutely horrifying dictatorships that led to starvation and death to an incredible amount of people.  If we don't work to educate people, we will never change their minds","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think this was one of the best videos I've seen on this channel, it just works so well. I'm a leftist and I study politics and social services at university. I run into alot of far left communist types and at the start I was very much interested in what they had to say but now I keep away. Although I'm more of a democratic socialist I empathise with them but the way they go about spreading their message is detrimental not only to them but the left as a whole. They've burst into lectures, constantly harass everyone and show up and try and sell you stuff at rallies they don't have anything to do with. They are now despised on campus which ruins any leftists groups chance to gain stable ground. For them it's mostly about the image then the goal, they like the idea of being a radical so much that they no longer care about public perception. Unfortunately this sets not only them back but every other left leaning person back too. They need to understand the consequences of poor public perception.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"My one complaint about this video is that it fails to capture the sort of nihilistic hopeless 'bash the fash' that exists among the great many of us who've looked at the reality of our current political landscape, at the reality of climate change, at the reality of entrenched systems, and have decided that there is nothing productive to do. There truly is no revolution. There's just revenge. And I feel morally and ethically compelled to keep trying to improve things even in the face of futility--I think it would be wrong to do otherwise--but I don't for a second confuse that for real hope.   We're fucked. I mean, that's the real truth of it, right? And we can keep fighting all the way down like goddamned good people or we can lay down and it happen. There's a middle ground between those that Justine here is espousing, but it only exists for those who believe there's any reason to pursue it.   I don't think anything in this video is wrong. I just have a hard time grappling with how it might fit with my worldview, and in the end I don't think it does, and I don't think I'm anywhere close to alone in that worldview.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"My only critique of this is that I think you painted with too broad a brush. Your caricature of the left is a homolgomation of aynsyns, trots, SJWs, and I guess leftcoms?  There is little utility in painting 'the left' with so broad a brush. We're talking about schools of thought that fundamentally disagree on both methods and motives. There will never be 'left unity' because 'the left' is defined only by our opposition to 'the right,' a term nearly as vague as its opposite. The left will never agree on how to confront the problem because we disagree on what the problem is, and we also fundamentally disagree on the best way to go about combating the problem.   It's okay to be specific about who you are and who you oppose. I'm a Marxist Leninist and I am opposed to Imperialism above all else because I believe that imperialism is the greatest barrier to working class power, and I believe that all the specific forms of oppression are expressions of imperialism. Therefore, to dismantle bigotry, poverty, etc, we have to confront the root of the problem. This belief and approach differs on a fundamental level from the beliefs and approaches of anarchists, leftcoms, trots, etc. Anarchists, for example, barely (if ever) recognize the existence of imperialism at all.  I think this video is pretty good overall as its criticisms of certain elements of the left ring true. We do need to be doing a better job of cultivating an image that is appealing to the masses. We also need to do a better job of meeting people where they're at instead of demanding people abandon their fundamental beliefs at the drop of a hat. All that being said, however, I felt that the video fell a bit flat on how to move forward. Simply improving PR will not move us forward. Only class struggle can do that. I agree with Boots Riley for the most part on this. We have to prove to the masses that our methods work by winning real material victories, not symbolic ones. Only then can we begin to build a working class movement. An appealing public image is a component of that, for sure, but without the class struggle component, it will be just as futile as knocking over trash cans.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

My strange proclivities aside, I love the way you show the catch-22 of how good intentions and ideals keep getting lost amongst the rhetoric and increasingly berzonkers extremist tendencies people are falling into these days. She's got some good points, but it's overshadowed by an inability to look at things from a more rational perspective, and things only seem to be getting worse, not better. Each time one side of the politically extreme perspective pushes, the other side pushes back even harder, with neither coming out the victor in an ever-increasing escalation.

"Social justice and rock and roll sounds good to me. I personally don't do drugs, but you do you.  But in all seriousness, extremists ruin everything. It did get both the political left and right closer together than they've ever been, but I'm not giving them any credit for that. The right probably think their extremists are idiots, and I can imagine some other people on the left feeling the same about our extremists. Also, anger doesn't get your points across properly. You get branded an SJW, and nobody heard what you actually said. I'll give two example arguments that I could personally back:  'Facism is just not sustainable in the end, since it would require a dictatorship to work in practice. And you're pretty much cutting yourself off from human resources by completely barring immigrants, so any facist system that would actually work in practice is just heading for an economical collapse in the long run.'  'Facism is not sustainable, because they want to kill us all! The alt-right is already lynching people in the streets, we can't allow this!'  Which one comes off as more believable to you? The ice cold motherfucker approach, it works. Also, add a dash of sass, it tends to prevent the actual alt-right from jumping you the moment you comment. Taking a deep breath before you line up your arguments is a good investment in the long run.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I loved the video, is an amazing discussion between very relevant point of views. I lived most of my life among anarchists and communists, some of my family were involved in creating the Brazilian communist party and were torture in the military dictatorship for it, and that's why I tend to side with Tabby. I just want to be clear that is think the discussion about how communists present themselves to the world is absolutely relevant. I could never accept the ideas present by Justine about leftists been more likeable, because a great portion of them already are, they will never be likeable to the rich, or even those middle class that think they are rich, but they are very likeable to the poor, even though the character of Justine, represented by you, is already a much more effective and violent to the status quo than Tabby (being a trans leftist). Here in Brazil, much more than a problem of image, the left (and I restricting it to communists and anarchists) needs union, we have some leftists very capable in the 'P.R.' part, and they should do that, and we also have a dire need for antifas and black blocks to fight the fascists, the thing that is missing is coordination and acceptance between the two. I live in a  country that is ridden with fascism, slouching towards a dictatorship again (thanks for couping us AGAIN), and I'm desperate to take this idea of union to the left (here it is now divided between Reformists, 'Lulists', left-centrists, Socialists, Communists and Anarchists, the bigger groups), I would love some to hear some ideas from you about reuniting the left as organized group (even though just reading this sentence is laughable).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Yeah. This video demonstrates why I probably won't ever Patreon ContraPoints, even though she often makes good points - but she tends to drown those points in so-called production values. Which presumably a lot of her audience likes, but I don't. Obviously, that's a matter of taste. But it so happens that some of her critique of the left is that they don't try for the mass appeal. Which is probably correct. And which is also my critique of ContraPoints. Make of that what you want.  Oh, just to avoid confusion. While I like many points CP makes, by no means do I like all of them - I suspect CP is quite a bit more left than I am, and that is while I am quite a bit more left than average in the US (but then, I'm not in or from the US, and while I see myself on the left side of things, I don't see myself personifying the Left (whatever that means) - I usually vote Green instead).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"For those of us who relate most to Tabby, I think the pill that Natalie is presenting can be hard to swallow. I just watched this video yet again and the line that stung most, was the idea that I don't actually want my ideas to win. Even as a trans person who is a leftist out of necessity and not aesthetic, I still think there is a part of me that fetishizes counter culture, especially considering I was a punk rocker before I was an anarchist. Really good shit. Messing up my head existentially because again, the idea of joining in on respectability politics just hurts so much but may be necessary. Rebranding. Like Justine said, it's only the centrists and fascists who really understand the importance of this, and that's why they're winning. Ugh... Hard stuff to think about but important as ever because it's not productive to remain stagnant and ignorant and not question your own beliefs constantly.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I agree that the left has an optics and communication problem but I haven't seen any act of solidarity from white people closely resembling real action to the degree of 'i'm going to risk violence and incarceration to beat this guy's ass so you don't have to and so that can't harm you'. Maybe it doesn't appeal to white centrists but it warms my black ass heart. I get that the white middle class has more power and that at some point they are going to need to be appealed to in order to get shit done but my concern is how watered down messaging becomes in order to do so. I haven't seen it from you specifically even though I'm a new subscriber but the refrain I keep hearing is 'go slow' as a response to how to appeal to whites. We are expected to appeal to their fragility. I guess this is a long winded way of saying i'm skeptical that its an effective approach to continually appeal to a class of people who are at best blissfully willfully ignorant of my oppression and at worst complicit.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Okay... in the past I've harped on Anti-fa Cat Girls--but that is only because it does not look good on paper. Seeing now in practice... all I can really say is...  Yes.  That being said, my stance has always been: when trying to change how things work--having people more than willing to smash stuff and break people's faces is always handing to have nearby. As sometimes... things do move to violence. This stupid 'gandhi is not a ridiculous goal for people' notion ignores that most countries have armies... I've found people being all, 'violence is bad' can be handled by asking, 'would it be feasible to have a country without any army.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Not the most popular opinion on the radical left, but when you live in a democracy you cant say that the rules of due processes, free speech or general social safety is only extended to the ones that has a certain sett of values.

"I cringed at the 'not real communism' argument... That's one of the weakest arguments imho. Plus, by abandoning it, we can call out the right when they say 'that's not capitalism, that's corporatism.' There are about one of two roads to take in response to it. There's the Marxist Leninists who prefer to rehabilitate the image of 20th century socialism, which has its merit within an academic context. But as far as PR/propaganda is concerned, it's very weak as well. I prefer to go down the road of 'The Bolsheviks were the first to successfully do communist revolution, so of course they made plenty of mistakes. We have the advantage of hindsight and we are able to learn from their mistakes.' MLs who just want to rebuild what existed 50 or 100 years ago, for me, are really engaging in a conservative reading of history, wanting to bring back a by-gone era. We need to learn from the past and go forward.  On another note, as far as propaganda is concerned within the privileged, imperialist countries, even throughout the 20th century at the height of global communist revolution, it never happened in the centers of empire. As far as strategy is concerned, I think it may be better to focus on the polarization between the centers and peripheries of capitalism-imperialism, and this will redefine our goals into something much more sellable. By focusing on the imperialist nature of capitalism, our goals will inevitably change. And within the centers of empire, one of our goals can and must be anti-war. Anti-war is pretty easy to sell, I've found. This cause is more important in my opinion than the left fighting for universal healthcare or the nationalization of the banking industry, or whatever it is. Socialism is a scary term in US politics. But anti-war is not. Plus, organizing people around anti-war, a very sellable position, can help to increase the consciousness of the masses. We'll see. That's my strategy.  Also cringe at the anarcho-syndicalist calling someone else a bad leftist. Anarchists are great at punching Nazis, but their program is far too liberal and individualistic. Gotta focus on the masses!  And screw the 'free marketplace of ideas.' Just like all markets, the winners go to those who have wealth and power. We do seriously need to work on dismantling it if the Left wants to have any serious fighting chance. And it lets Nazis participate, because they have wealth and power.  Just my two cents","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Brilliant! Thank you so much for illustrating a dialog that I've been having in my head for the last year or two, but couldn't quite express. Such a refreshing change from the typical circular firing squad that most of the youtube 'progressive/left'  seems to have become. People on the left of center always seem to think that it is enough to be right about issues and having the truth on their side will convince the masses to join them. The right is light years ahead when it comes to strategy, optics and marketing their ideas. What might have worked in the 60's isn't necessarily going to work in 2018. It's sad that rightwingers are able to show creativity and vision for their twisted ideas, while so much of the left is just stagnating in knee-jerk sectarianism and nostalgia for the past.   We need more people from within to challenge the movement to learn, grow and evolve into something that can actually achieve tangible results, instead of just playing vanity politics to show how righteous we are, because in the end it's only the results that matter and the more disenfranchised one is in society, the more crucial this fact becomes. It's annoying to see those in positions of privilege demand everyone take a non-compromising anti-pragmatic approach knowing that they have the option of sitting on a beach in Ibiza drinking cocktails and tweeting about the revolution while others are suffering real-life consequences of conservative legislation and judicial appointments. When you might get deported any day or lose your health insurance, there is a HUGE difference between a 'corporate democrat' and a republican. From a Marxist vs. Free Market Capitalist perspective they may just be two sides of the same coin, but people get stuck in one paradigm and lose perspective.   Stuff like that does turn people off to the left and I think it's important to point that out. The same principle applies for example to when a celebrity ally makes a slight error in judgment or perhaps is portrayed that way in the media, many on the left will tear into them without mercy and stage a public crucifiction to make an example out of them. That accomplishes nothing but turn people off as well. People need to learn to pick their battles and spend more time attacking the real enemies instead of using allies as their whipping boy/girl. Anger needs to be channeled at the right, not at each other.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Nice video. I'd like to make an observation. As someone who loves to debate EVERYONE, I've analysed myself and studied my behavior, and really, keeping cool is FUNDAMENTAL. Violence and uncontrolled emotions produce cognitive dissonance, you only make the other person close their mind or even worse, make them more sure of what they believe.  I know it's difficult and it will obviously take time, but I've seen the changes, I've seen how changing the tactics and practicing intellectual debate has made my ideas come across people I'd never believed would change their mind. I obviously get frustrated over fascists or extreme neoliberals, it's not like I don't feel the emotion, but I don't come across these stereotypes much. Also, most of the people on the extremes are ignorant with herd mentality, they want to belong to some group so their arguments are usually void or straw-man. You can't fight the right with ignorance or violence, so I'd said 'maintaining the cool and reading a lot' would be a fair critique  (also, never believe you are fully right, always keep on questioning yourself and expanding your knwoledge) .","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I dunno if this video would be safe to post there or if it might get me banned from those Facebook groups for being a counterrevolutionary or not giving people warning about offensive content or some shit like that. On Facebook you gotta walk on eggshells in some of the left-wing groups to avoid getting banned. These characters just remind me so much of real people I know online. Except for the fascist.

"Great content (and also artistically appealing and funny).  I agree that 'the left' (that sinister bunch - I hate the word because it makes the right always sound, well, so right...) has to find a winning strategy. In my opinion, talking about theories and revolution is indeed counterproductive. One has to talk about wealth inequality. It is the main  problem (well, and climate change, but nobody cares...).  I am from Europe, so I am an outsider looking in on US politics, but since the US is dominating world politics, I think I can state my opinion. Videos like yours are very important, especially to gain support of younger people. But older generations have to be won over with different strategies.   Conservative and libertarian strategists and think tanks worked for decades to sell their ideology of the free market to the general public. I think it is no conspiracy theory to say that this is the goal of the main figures of the right wing movement. To achieve their goal,  they manipulate people, use fear (red scare, Islamophobia, Trans- and Homophobia, the overbearing state, 'leftist' bias in media and academia, etc.), patriotism, pseudo science (also called economics), make alliances with religious nuts, bigots and misogynists, use buzz words like freedom, individualism, 'tax is theft', form (pseudo) grassroots movements like the tea party.   Even the corporate media (not only fox news) contribute to this manipulation. I know that there are many very good journalists out there, doing a very important job (Jane Mayer comes to my mind). But I remember that there was no opposition in the German media when the social welfare state was cut and neo-liberal politics were imposed. There is no alternative was a universal slogan! (Where was the free speech there? If nobody prints or broadcasts your opinion, you may also stay quiet.) People were systematically scared with the 'age pyramid', they were told that they would face old age without a pension, that the state would be bankrupt if they don`t accept the changes made (I know, Americans hardly know what a welfare state is, instead you have 'the American dream' - sorry, I just puked). Well, the people get along with austerity while billionaires and corporations get richer and richer.    Now there is also the internet with all those nice guys, from Rubin and Sargon to Dennis Prager, Alex Jones, Richard Spencer (there is someone catering for every age group and alt-flavour), in Germany Pegida and AfD ( Hungary and Poland are on the verge of full blown fascism). All of them discredit the left and the state (except the military) and scapegoat migrants. But what is the answer from the left??   Concentrating on wealth inequality in clear and simple words and having well founded strategies to work against it is the only option I see. One has to communicate this using the Internet, real left media - heck, going door to door - the 99% have to finally understand that they are in the same boat. That will be a hard sell.

I'm a general leftist, by my own assessment, and I appreciate this critique of the current state of the leftist politics on the Internet. I totally agree that we need to consider our optics, as well as focus in more, perhaps in the middle of both extremes, as to what our goal is. We are, perhaps not counter-culture exactly, but our opponents are gaining increasing power and its contributing directly to hurt. To pain. Of course, these are not times of peace and rest in the U.S, or even internationally, and due to this, some of our own have lost sight of what we are. We are logical, and beautiful, and reacting so emotionally to these things, fucking shit up and screaming, isnt the way to go. I hope more realize this, though I'm not even perfect myself.

Because it is a real thing and my country, Brazil, (and other countries on Latin America) has suffered a lot because of it. Our underdeveloped economy historically dependent on the U.S., the continuous interference of the U.S. and central European countries in our politics, even giving financial and military support to brutal dictatorships, such as our 21-year-long military dictatorship and the Pinochet's regime on Chile, for example. Not to mention U.S. intervention on democratically elected governments (such as the Allende government and, to give a more recent example, the Venezuelan government) and attacks on the sovereignty of socialist countries like Cuba. And all in name of the economic hegemony of capitalist nations over peripheral countries (the so-called 'third world', the 'underdeveloped countries').

"As a 'liberal' (yeah yeah hiss at me all you want) and what the political compass tests label as 'Left wing, Libertarian', I will explain why the 'social justice' brand of leftism is not just losing the war for the support of the masses, but being absolutely destroyed. It is because you do not pick your targets properly. You attack 'white straight men' as a collective catagory, without any regard for individuals within that demographic. In fact that is a big issue for you guys...collectivism. I know SJW types (I feel dirty using that term) in my personal life, and I have been called a 'privileged, white man' on more than one occasion, despite the fact that, as a gay man who was raised by my grandparents (my parents both died) in one of the most impoverished areas of the UK, in a house that didn't have an indoor bathroom, and I have a physical disability that means I cannot work and rely on benefit money to simply survive, I am not privileged in any way that means much in reality. I knew a lot of 'straight white men' who I grew up with as peers who are not alive any longer because they committed suicide or took drug overdoses after finding that society didn't want them and that they didn't have a future due to unemployment. Drugs were the only real escape for many of them from the sheer shittyness of their realities. If they were 'privileged', they sure as hell didn't get anything from it.  You are losing the battle for people because they constantly see people on your 'side' going on about things that mean nothing to anyone outside your bizarre little cliques, like 'Man spreading' and '72 genders' and 'Sexist air conditioning' and 'Being looked at without consent is rape'. They see you guys labeling normal moderates as 'nazis'. etc. Most people have genuine problems in their lives, like feeding themselves and their families. They don't think misgendering someone who looks like a guy by calling them 'he' is really all that important or a massive societal issue.  For me, being left wing means believing in fairness for everyone in society. It means recognising genuine inequalities and working to reduce or possibly remove those inequalities. It doesn't mean ignoring reality and facts to push identity based, collectivist ideas onto people who just want to live a better life. People are not slaves to the many labels that they wear. Their sexuality, gender, sex, race etc are not identifiers of their personality or ethical makeup, nor their standing in society.   I think the saddest part of it all is that Marx would hate you guys. You read his works but misunderstand the core concept that it is class that matters when you talk about power and privilege, not any accident of birth like the colour of your skin or what you have between your legs.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Is this primarily out of an america-centric perception? I presume as much but wondering because it might help me get past the whole playing characters bit. A lot of it hits European equivalents as well, but certain portions stick out as odd to me, especially the denomination 'a leftist' and equivocating them all to being boring academics and well, being anti-religion. Including the perception of communism being very different depending on which country you go to. (I'm ignoring all the aesthetic talk because I'm broken on that level, I have no understanding of aesthetics) Also, a million thanks to the black bloc, while I agree with some of the criticism of their usage of violence when it's indiscriminate, they've saved the lives of some of my comrades on the streets. Literally.   (Communists in my country for example, are not anti-religion, at least the largest communist party. I'd also go deeper into it, but if it's america-centric, I'll be out of my depth but, fuck centrists. <3)  P.s That ice cold joke...

"The whole 'communism is always bloody and leads to famine' thing? Yeah, San Marino and the Indian state of Kerala would like to have a word with anyone who says that. These regions both elected communist governments and did pretty damn well for themselves. San Marino's commies (actually a coalition of the Sanmarinese Communist and Socialist Parties) held office from 1945 to 1957 and were voted out peacefully in the end. As for Kerala, they turned out better off than much of the rest of India.  I wouldn't mind if we Americans gave communism the old college try for one year if it meant kicking the rich in the ass and stopping 45. Take one year to go commie and redistribute all the wealth. After that year is up, we then adopt a blend of European social democracy and Chinese socialism--the best of both and none of the flaws of either. From there, we'd only go communist once every fifty years to keep the playing field level. If you decide you don't like it, you'd only have to go through it once, maybe twice tops. Maybe three times if you're born in a commie year AND make it to your 100th birthday. And keep in mind that this is coming from a guy whose politics are a mix of left-libertarianism, anarcho-socialism, technocracy, and a dash of Maoism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The amount of police officers who've faced consequences for the murder of black-'  You look over to your car. The letters 'BLM' have been scraped into the paint.  You turn to the leftist.   'WHAT THE FUCK? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY CAR?'   The leftist's face contorts into a snarl. Their eyes well up with tears.   'Fuck your car', sobs the leftist. 'Fuck your privileged life. Black people are D Y I N G.'  You stand there in disbelief as you attempt to process the situation.  You look once more at the letters now etched into your passenger side door. You look again at the figure standing before you. Their fists are clenched, eyes full of defiance. You are furious. 'Listen to me, fuckface. I don't know who you are or what your fucking problem is. But you better believe you're paying for a new paint job to get this shit covered up.'  'Typical' , the leftist hisses. The word is said with such venom that you begin to wonder if this is one of those reptilians your crazy uncle Alex was always yammering on about.   'White people care more about scratched paint than they do about people of color.' The leftist is crying again.  You've had enough. You tell the leftist that you're calling the cops.

"Very good video, and it helped me understand more about how confused the far-left actually is.  For instance, do you realize that 'Centrists', and your average low and middle class Capitalist, think a lot of the same things about Leftist, Socialists and Communists, as you do about us (this is very paradoxical).  Also, I can't see how you can truly believe that long-term Marxism (in a free society) can actually work (ever), on a scale as big as the US (especially without the assimilation of diversity), let alone, the entire world, especially using your 'personal property' clause... materialism is a definite no-no, in most Marxist camps.  The US may have a lot of problems and flaws, but people here are 100% better off than most of the world (including other western cultures), so we are doing something right.  Wouldn't the ideal solution be to 'upgrade' our current system... fine tune it?  Take all the energy and resources use against it, and peacefully, make it better!  There is no true consensus of how Marxism would even work.  People have been trying to understand how it would work for about 170 years, and still can't figure it out.  The 'True Marxism has never been tried' argument is flawed, because there are thousands of ideas of 'True Marxism'... I even have a few of my own, and I know it's BS, but still a fun intellectual exercise.  And that's what it IS, an Intellectual Exercise... and should stay that way.  Because for ANY of it to work, eventually, individuality, personal freedoms, artistic talents and creative expressions, would have to be put on the back burner, behind the collective and total equality of outcome... to curb the chances of jealousy and envy (can't have those pesky feelings in an equal society).  All this would incubate and give birth to a thriving underground and black market, of creative people who can't live in such a stifling world, with just as many vices and power struggles, but no control over them.  And, this could only end with 2 outcomes: 1) sever punishment of these ingrates... further stifling person expressions and freedoms.  2) Counter Revolution... which is the eventual outcome.  Why?  Because people need to be free to have their own ideas (and stuff), and ain't NO commie gonna make them feel guilty about going to 'brunch with THESE people'!!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It shouldn't matter that sometimes a few Leftists are easy targets. You could make endless 'cringe' compilations for both sides; fascists have their awkward members, and we have ours. The problem is that since this is very much a country sympathetic to fascism, those of us who are against it get held to a much, *much* higher standard of conduct. Fascists succeed by misbehaving, while leftists who do even a pale imitation of the same are held up as reasons why the essjaydubbayoos need to go.  So while anger is natural, and deserved, and while that anger should be on display when out in force for demonstrations, its inelegance is being used against us and we need additional strategy for the time being. I /have/ found that a 'cool' tone works better when talking one on one.  A few articulate people staying calm and keeping an arsenal of statistics at the ready bolsters our image as a whole, and gives other left-wingers confidence. Basically, the Left needs to organize how we engage--not everyone can act detached, but designated mouthpieces can do it for them and serve the collective good in the process. It's not our anger, but rather our vulnerability, that will be discarded if we present an unflappable united front. On the other hand, I believe this emphasis on detachment earns us short-term brownie points while robbing us of the fire needed to truly right wrongs, because humans can never freaking reach a happy medium. Has politeness increased wages for Wal-Mart employees? Will it bring factory jobs back from Bangladesh where 12-year-olds now make our shirts? Shouldn't it give us pause that a respectful demeanor earns praise from the very people who benefit from the labor and deprivation of marginalized groups? Disobedience harms the disobedient, but serves the ones who come after.  Therefore, my take is that our mouthpieces should be politicians, which is why we need to reach firm consensus on candidates and get our asses to the polls, as Republicans have done with great success for decades. The onus of change can't be entirely placed on citizens; it's an elected representative's job, after all, to advocate in a level-headed manner. It's they who listen, they who amplify, and they who change laws. The main reason Democrats are so fractured is because we have no real faith in most of our guys, so we aren't a reliable source of support, therefore they turn corporate out of self-preservation, then we trust them even less, and on and on in a vicious circle.

Sure, we do disagree a lot on certain views, but I like how he is capable to differentiate on multiple topics, not trying to only speak out for one particular corner, actually trying to get a bigger picture of the whole. I have way too many important things other than politics to cover, but nevertheless, it's entertaining and often refreshing to get some opinions and viewpoints from ContraPoints.

"Um, no I think Centrists don't like SJWs because they are Centrists. Centrists acknowledge that there are problems with the system but also acknowledge that change must be tortoise-based because change is extremelly dangerous. Japan is the perfect example. Japan is the future of the current system. We've all seen people who are addicted to their mobile phones for example, but we are yet to see a situation like Japan where a kid will starve to death in an internet cafe he's spent three days in wearing an adult diaper. We're yet to see young men who openly admit to preferring to collect cards than have sex. We've still got more young people in prison than old people - though possibly due to mass-immigration more than reality, because we've obscured our 'Age Bomb'. See Japan is perfect as a control experiment because they have not embraced mass-immigration. We can literally see the effects of Leftwing social changes on a country without the Globalist fig-leaf. We can see these changes, due to their near totality and rapidity have literally put Japan on the endangered species list. The Japanese are like human pandas now - they are refusing to bed one another.  If dying out is the end result of social changes, then those social changes are bad. We are in this for survival of the species, justice is a secondary issue in comparison. Japan also has micro-apartments... which I personally find as distrubing as battery farms. Human beings, all living beings, need space and privacy. So at the same time as dying-out they are overpopulated in the cities. There are entire villages that are now occupied by one or two people - in one village the sole remaining occupant built scarecrows in order to have a sense of 'life' going on around them. Like something out of 'I am Legend'.  It is a society that is totally fucked-up... and not in a fun way. Meanwhile the oppressive Theocracies and chauvanistic states of the Developing World are having population booms and faminines and stuff. So this is the likely course for Japan in the near future if they want to survive. Just as quickly as the feminist revolution and tech revolutions put them on the death spiral, the counteraction will put them on the life-spiral again. Conformity being a much more present phenomenon in the East. Centrists are fun. : )","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Much as I like communism in theory, the ideal society it theorizes tends to be a post-scarcity one, and I've come to realize that there are some things that can only be scarce by their very nature. Not everyone can have a giant dream home, especially with population figures what they are, and not everyone can get a front row seat to Hamilton, or even just a ticket to it.  As an alternative to Antifa, I might also suggest Redneck Revolt, who seem to be taking a less outwardly violent role, and seem to work more on support, like having their own medic teams at events or having people keep an eye on armed fascists at events.

"Funny the Social Justice crowd thinks 'liberals protect fascists,' and fascists think 'Liberals protect (Stalinist or similar) Communists'  It's probably not helpful to bring up general relativity considering how unhelpful the Victorian Era philosophers are, but I keep being reminded of this physics exercise where objects A and B are moving away from object C in opposite directions at .95c relative to object C, and since no object can move at c relative to any other object (this is a result of spacetime shifting the goalposts, mass increases at 1/(1-v^2/c^2)^0.5, time and length shrink by (1-v^2/c^2)^0.5).  Result being A thinks B and C are more or less in formation, and B thinks A and C are more or less in formation, and C of course sees A and B as equidistant along their trajectories.  I think the 'personal property' vs 'private property' thing needs a bit more clarification, you seem to have 'productive property' vs 'unproductive property' and Badmouse Productions seemed to have 'property you're using' vs 'property your'e not using,' if this stuff's supposed to be a new legal code, presumably you would like politicians to run on this stuff and win on it so that shit can get done, well, how can constituents be confident this will be miles better and not miles worse?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Is there a reason your Antifa didn't bring up the fact that channers are using incitement tactics to try to force violent engagement (going so far as to brag about it on an easily available Vice documentary short) and trying to gin up opposition for their 'violence' despite the fact that it is used almost universally in defense of other, real people? The best example of the last part is the clergy in Charlottesville. We have ample evidence of incitement trying to be used, false-flag operations being planned (no matter how transparent or inane), and violent intentions being made clear on the right (extremist and non-extremist). We have very little evidence of antifa-initiated violence outside of police reports that are contradicted by eyewitnesses and video.  I think that's an important part of the context right now - there really is a violent shadow war waiting in the wings between the militia subculture and the antifa subculture, both going back decades. One is defending people who are trying to work through legal systems while the other wants to burn down the government and make room for Jesus to come back.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Man, I've been watching you for a long time. I was really happy to see you come back. I think you've said quite a lot that has been meaningful criticism of the alt-right. While I agree with you that the alt-right (and the mainstream right as well) is highly subversive . . . but so is the left and communism.  Since you've been coming back, I've been in agreement with you, but felt uneasy about you not addressing the left. If you are going to say that any argument from the 'right' is really just about hiding 'hatred' by promoting subversive fascisim, then why can't the right just say that  the 'left' is just about hiding their 'hatred' by promoting a subversive communist agenda.  Its really nice to see you address this issue, even if I don't think you came down hard enough on the left. I don't agree with everything you've said, but I'm glad to see that you're still a really respectable guy . . . even if you've become significantly more . . . weird. . . than 10 years ago (although, the weirdness really makes for a terribly pleasing aesthetic in your videos).

"Tbh I didn't learn anything from this video.  It should be obvious that advocating for the reintroduction of failed systems isn't going to make people be open for leftism. But what is leftism even supposed to mean in the sense ContraPoints uses it? Social democracy? That system that is getting abolished in western countries since the 60s? Universal basic income? That's stuff that didn't work in the first place or doesn't solve any of the contradictions of capitalism. Even if leftists would get into power and then just go for that and stop it after that they too will fail and it will be another episode of 'socialism failed'. I am from Germany and here we have a politician called Sahra Wagenknecht who is a genuine communist but explains in simple non-theoretic terms why the current system can't work forever, that we should get rid of it, how we can get rid of it and she is kind of popular in general. However even if she doesn't mention terms like socialism or communism other politicians and the media always try to paint her as evil Stalinist and people are easily influenced by that.  This just means that you just can't present yourself in a cool way and explain your thoughts in an easily understandable way. This isn't enough. You must hurt people's minds by showing them that their beliefs like that in national superiority or the free market actually do not work that way and are counterproductive to their own interests. As example liberals agree with the idea that humans should be free and respected and have rights. So you need to point out how leftists feel the same but then argue that because how our current system works most people get these rights denied, some more and some less and that if you really believe in things like in freedom for the individual you must set them free from the boundaries that come with how capitalism works.  Then offer a few changes you would introduce that seem radical but are actually applicable. Like Obama did with Obama-Care. The point is just to say that we shouldn't stop there because that's the flaw that always came with social democrats i.e. They thought that that would be enough and sooner or later were forced to repeal it. However without theories on how to get there and what to do there you will never be able to do anything that can work out in practice.   Fuck Antifa though. They hurt the left more than any unironic Stalinist does.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think you're partly right but where I think you're wrong is that the 'ice cold mofos' will be enough. To give context, I come from Wichita Kansas were lots of jobs have left to overseas factories and call centers (believe it or not Wichita was a major call center hub before offshoring took off). And I can tell you people are still very angry about this after decades of all this happening. The irony is that Kansas use to be a hotbed for socialism and it was brought about by the fire and brimstone kind of rhetoric that you'd expect from the 'heart land.' So my point is that not only do you need 'ice cold mofos' you need the loudest and strongest voice of preachers to get at more people, especially the working class folks that went GOP over the decades. If you speak to their plight and show them who's taking money out of their pockets (notice how Politco's article on Tom Price's little private jet travel got him in trouble enough to make Trump say something about it?) then they'll have no problems siding with what looks like a leftist because if you speak to their plight and make them feel that they can move mountains then they'll damn well try. Remember, FDR and the New Deal was a response to the fact that unions used similar rhetoric and mobilized a significant part of the working class in his time. I think we can do that again. It's a question of if, not when someone will do it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This video is actually a very good example of the failures in Liberalism to correctly understand the true left is and its actual problems are, in the context of Liberalism own US very fetish of a petty left, and its narcissistic fixation on things like optics, which are far less scientific and practical than Communism.  Inadvertently, in your wrong appraisal of what leftist failings are, avoiding a very ordinary working class struggle against Capitalism, you've highlighted that Liberals are the biggest barriers to meaningful change. By second guessing ordinary workers movements with philisophical and academic posturing, the Liberal can only be a centrist.  Clintonians and Blairites alike, fixate on preserving the material status quo but making it more accessible to diverse people. The exact opposite of what true leftists want.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"For all the criticisms being thrown at this video, the communist cat girl using queer as an insult? In my experience of leftist Twitter, that cat girl is probably at least trans, lesbian/bi/pansexual, polyamorous, surrounded by supportive followers calling her cute perpetually, and is likely a queer anarchist militant par excellance! It's naturally no coincidence that all of those signifiers apply to me in some capacity, and suffice it to say, I dive straight for deep cuts on all counts! I'm a trans NB woman, pansexual, and a relationship anarchist (yet have never been in a relationship/dated/sex'ed/kissed/unplatonic hugged/touched ungloved hands anyone); I have a adequate following that occasionally calls me cute when my anxiety doesn't push me away from Twitter for the sake of my mental stability, and it straight up isn't a revolution unless all the queers hurl the boot of systemic oppression into a black hole in the process of swallowing the sun and seize the right to be utterly nude wherever we dern well please, unless someone has trauma triggers stemming from genitalia, perhaps! All said, you're always welcome in the non-toxic dumpster fire part of socialist Twitter to learn true praxis! :D  That aside, I find the psychological dynamics on display between the two main characters of this installment to be fascinatingly fraught with dissonant self-critique. I find Gwen-no-Fear's observation that the Justine character, for all the self depreciation to be read into her lampshading of her arguably incoherent and ineffectual liberalism, is framed as a moral authority and teacher in the exchange in contrast to the more impulsive and toxic Tabby to be at least rather valid. Noting that, it seems that Justine could still be read as a more complicated character than that framing could potentially convey, leaving textual space to imagine a continuing internal conflict within Contra regarding her own perspective. This is also possibly illustrated by the... less charitable aspects of the Tabby character, intimating a ongoing process of forming a critical, if sympathetic, relationship with those currently further 'left', as it were. I found the observation of pedantic and counter-productive sectarianism an accurate reflection of behaviors I've seen among internet 'leftists'. Mexie's even made a video dissecting this phenomenon and how it contrasts with her experiences of discourse involving leftist ideas in academia. However, I find that, on the whole, Contra seems to hold a perhaps exceedingly broad perspective on the prevalence of 'excess' optimism and pessimism and attempts at accessibility by the left, at least in terms of her own claims regarding how she incorporated it into Tabby, likely the functional microcosm of leftism in this reading of the work. I grant acknowledgement of the presence of strains of both for fairness (Third-Worldists, posadists, and accelerationists for the former, and 'Read a book!' lefties for the latter as but a few examples) and agree such behaviors are worthy of criticism in their own right, but the framing erases a good deal of nuance in recognition of activities, beliefs, and discourse that runs counter to behaviors presented here. While this is arguably in accordance with the intention of the character's function by the author, I question the efficacy of accentuating the negative to quite this degree in reaching leftists to whom some of the observations apply, but not others, or even those with problems that have yet to be addressed. The word 'strawman' has already been attributed to the character a number of times, and I foresee it being used yet more. Despite that, while I don't find the term necessarily inaccurate myself, I also don't find it sufficient grounds for dismissal of all ideas conveyed by the character, as it could be easily argued that satire is necessarily reliant on strawmen by certain definitions.  So, as per usual, what was initially going to be a silly, cute joke ended up another indulgent treatise that took far too much time to write. Well, while I'm on my bullshit, some more indulgences. For the personal disadvantages that my psychological callouses and defense mechanisms cause, they do prove occasionally helpful in conveying the 'ice-cool' demeanor in some internet conversations on these topics. Also, whenever I hear 'breadlines and gulags' now, I tend to think of food stamps, homeless shelters, orphanages, and private prisons. Not that I'd by any means argue that the latter make the former excusable (I ain't no tankie!), but I find it helps put in perspective just how terrible capitalism is too not merely many, but most subjected to it. Approximately over a hundred million people continue to die every couple of years due to preventable causes because of private resource ownership after all, but y'all know that!

I think the real 'Far Left' (and by that I don't mean what Bill O'Reilly thinks is the 'Far Left', but the actual far Left) tend to not understand this while the moderates only understand this.  In a sense, I intellectually grew up debating on internet forums and YouTube, and then on to academia.  So it's never been absent from my life the impact of arguments and what makes an effective argument.  In terms of persuasion, your image and style matter as much as how you feel and what you think.  If you can combine all of these together in your own unique way, you will be able to compel people to respect your views.  There's a reason why ContraPoints, Nostalgia Chick, and similar YouTubers who remain calm and funny do not share the scorn that Anita Sarkeesian and so forth received.  And I think Contra is raising a really important point here, it has to do with the ability to be calm, collected, and in control.

"My initial reaction after watching this video was to go into the comments and post a 'Whilst I usually enjoy your videos...' kind of comment. But perhaps the reason your videos are so good, is that I did feel somewhat attacked by your characterisation of a movement I support. And the reason I felt attacked was because your critique was too close to the bone for my personal comfort. I certainly think that the radical left needs to work on rebranding itself, it needs to be able to gain traction with real people again. But it's always difficult to balance ideology with accessibility. Because the more fervently you begin to believe something, the harder it is to concede that it needs to be somewhat watered down to be palatable to the unconverted. How do you make advocating for revolution appear inoffensive and realistic? How do you set achievable goals without compromising the integrity of your radical beliefs? How do you destroy fascism without insisting on destroying it? It's difficult to figure out, and its something we should be putting our minds to. But I'm not even sure where to begin.

"Loved the video! One thought I'd like to add regarding optics, though: Their perception can change, dramatically. The right under Trump has pretty successfully become less and less crypto and has shifted the discurse partly by just being unabashedly (from our view) awful and never, ever backing down. Turns out a lot of people kinda respect that. I think pussyfooting around clear commitments to left-wing ideas can hurt from a very strategic standpoint, too. Bernie called himself a socialist, which is pretty wild for US standards and while he ultimately failed I would argue that more people standing up and clearly commiting to and communicating left-wing ideas can normalise them in the long run.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Just a few proposal to make the antifa movement more appealing  1. Do not call yourself antifa  I know that sound dumb, but people don't like a reaction movement. They usually prefer a movement promoting an idea or defending something dear to them. That's why saying you are defending our democracy is something that can be appealing. You can say you are constitutionalist or freedom loving american (yes the right usually use these terms, but it doesn't mean you can't take it back or find something better I suck with naming things). Prove this by mobilising not only against facist, but also by trying to promote ideas like proportional voting (you can always call it 1=1, for 1 vote for 1 citizen, afterall trump is in charge despite the fact more people voted for hillary). 2. Reach out Try to associate with other organisations that aren't fighting for your idea, but that may be affected by the rise of facist. Try to see if the organiser of a pride would be ok with having NON VIOLENT representative of your movement join in a rally. Or try reaching out to mothers organisations fighting for better gun regulations (the facist are usually pro guns). Movement for the rights of minority can also be people that you may reach out to. After all  I doubt they'd all be hostile to a group litteraly fighting facist (has long has you show you will be well behave and respectful). Always ask nicely and accept calmly if they refuse insulting them doesn't help anyone.   Reaching out to those group will make you appealing to a wider range of organisations. It will help you also expand your own view of the world. Finally it will create a greater solidarity within left leaning group which would never have though fighting facist would help them live a better live.  3. Rebrand yourself Contra made this point clear enough, so I just want to stretch the point quickly that looking mother fucking ice is better than sounding like lunatics. Be conscious of your image and try projecting a calm and steady movement fighting lunatics waving tikky torches.  4. Take time for introspection You should ask yourself not why you are fighting facist (they are obviously terrible), but for what (familly, ideology,personnal experience,etc.). Taking a bit of time to think about that and trying then to integrate those personnal motivations into your ideologies and discourses can go a long way into making you more sympathic to a wide audience and more internaly motivated to carry this fight to the end. I'm personally motivated, because my grand parents had their lives destroyed by the nazi occupation of Belgium. They lived in fear and distrust everywhere they went and even 70 years after they never forgot these 5 horrible years. And I swore that it would never happen again that I'll do what I can so that it never happen again. I'm watching the rise of the nazi from Canada and I know that this will spread here.

"I agree with the brunt of the criticism - the academic, white, Internet-based, memetic Left has a terrible image among the general public, and our general posture and attitude doesn't help.  I don't quite agree with the proposed solution.  It doesn't go deep enough.  The problem is, I think, deeper than simple optics, presentation, or propaganda strategies (consider Trump; no matter how stupid, funny, or ineffective he looks, his base remains unshakable; it's a good exercise to consider *why*). The problem is that the academic Left has disconnected itself from the workers, from the disenfranchised, from thieves and beggars and winos, from miners and construction people and streetwalkers and undocumented immigrant housemaids.  And it's easy to see why, and it's a hard problem to solve.  What does a privileged, middle-class anarcho-syndicalist trans catgirl have in common with your average opiod-crisis victim? How can they even approach each other, or speak the same language? And yet it's for them that leftist politics exist in the first place.  The task of connecting intellectual to worker is hard, but it's been done before; we'd do well to study how, to learn from history (e.g. the mass line), and then actually doing it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Seems the solution is what Black and other PoC have been saying all along: centre and elevate and follow the leadership of Black and other PoC in the Leftist movement.  All of those 'sjw freak out' clips you had were of white people.  Not that Black people don't get emotional.  Not that the angry black woman stereotype is true or undamageing.  Not that 'sassiness' as defined by a white audience is a virtue.  Just that when you have been playing the anti-fascist game your whole entire life, (and PoC and especially Black people and especially especially Black women do not have a choice in this matter; their existence is anti-fascist and anti-fascism is key to their survival) the elusive 'thick-skin' so often touted by the right as what the Left is lacking, develops pretty early.

I largely agree with your critique of leftist movements, but when Justine begins to make a point or offer an alternative to Tabby's unpalatable militancy, that point is almost immediately rescinded or obscured by satire and jokes, e.g. when Justine talks about rebranding the left, she, in two separate instances, actually makes real suggestions in how to rebrand, with both the 'ironic' book covers and in being 'ice cold motherfuckers'. But both of these suggestions are presented in such a manner and with such a tone that it makes it hard to discern whether or not you actually support rebranding at all.

"It is the few self-conscious lefties like you keeping liberalism alive, fresh, and approachable. Please never stop. Your degree is not going to waste. I'm in grad school now and I think how we think is even more important than what we think about. You're totally right. Quoting theory and philosophers means nothing to most people. Knowing how to make a just movement appealing is what real intelligence is.   Also, from the little I've seen from undercover stories in fascist groups, they do sell themselves as very approachable on the surface. They gain so many followers or sympathizers that way. Their theory is still there, though. It's just that they provide it only to those who seek it out rather than spewing it in people's faces like Tabby does here. It's on the backwater forums and in dark, intimate coffee shops that Hitler and the like are talked about in theoretical and applicable ways. But on the streets and on the internet there are the vast majority of Americans who like their stuff, desire normalcy, and have the capacity to sympathize, but end up confused as to who to sympathize with. It sucks that fascist rhetoric is about convincing a crowd that they should be mobilized to act for themselves while more liberal rhetoric is about convincing a crowd that they should be mobilized to act for others.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I would agree with your critique of using black bloc in our current political moment; small mobilizations of anarchists is actually pretty anti-worker because it operates under the assumption that only the activist core understands the threats of fascism and that workers won't fight to protect themselves. I'm in the ISO, and while we don't disagree with violence we would agree that tactically mass mobilizations like the one in Boston are much more effective.   The left needs to be recruiting, we need to be mindful of our image but I won't compromise on my beliefs to attract workers to our side; the only way that we're going to get better at recruitment conversations is by having a lot of them. Ultimately people's attitudes change through struggle so getting more folks involved in fights for reforms and fights against oppression in our current day is essential to building any revolutionary workers movement. Also we need an independent labor party in the US and DSA could become that party potentially if they don't squander their moment and right now they don't seem to be.  If you're looking for some sexy Marxist literature you should definitely check out haymarketbooks.org.

DO most antifa members also, say, help poor folks out with charity or getting them better jobs under the current system, or contribute to shit like The Trevor Project for LGBT Americans?  Do they fight to ensure far less harassment and murder of trans people?  do they fight to keep shit like DACA legal?  How many 'potential rapes', esp. of women, have members of antifa prevented? Or is the 'extent' of their 'revolutionary leftism' just punching nazis every now and then... and talking theory on their 'off-days'?

"Can't stand that term- 'praxis'  When you REALLY look at what it 'describes', it's pretty simple, but the fact that a lot of leftists feel the need to USE SUCH A 'CRYPTIC' WORD is really fucking obnoxious.  Just say, 'Directly getting involved in Movement X or Y or punching Nazis', not 'praxis', ffs  'Praxis' seems to imply something far more complex and mysterious than just... leftist direct action (more or less).  Funny enough, I think many militant leftists use the word 'praxis' to sound or feel 'smarter', but, to everyone else, they just come across as conceited know-it-alls.  And it's not just praxis but constantly using 'dialectical' and other 'esoteric' terms very-few people outside a certain circle are familiar w/ or really give a shit about.  You're def. NOT gonna 'win the information war' by constantly referencing all of this 'academic' shit.    You have to win hearts and minds *on the ground w/ language that they can understand and are familiar with*.  I know that seems 'too regular' for the bourgeois elites w/in 'militant leftism', but it must be done.  :)  Also... I think it's many of the white, middle-class (or higher) Marxists and left-anarchists who mainly do this overly-academic shit.  One could, interestingly, say that their 'privileged disconnection from a harsh life' allows them to talk all day long about theory and various philosophers and use all kinds of fancy terminology, forgetting that lots of people *don't have time to waste reading a gazillion Marxist and anarchist books and have to, say, scrape to get by and *already know* how fucked-up the system is directly.  However, Marxists and anarchists from worse-off socioeconomic bgs who are in various marginalized groups who know *the full reality of growing up in shit conditions* don't have time for that 'academic all the time' shit; they likely know how to 'explain in layman's terms' what they're after politically.

"I absolutely loved the video, and practically all your videos. I'd call myself a leftist, a progressive, and a social democrat. Up until this year, I would've called myself a far leftist until this year with Antifa, when I suddenly found myself labeled as a 'liberal' (I actually still consider myself one. I tend to use liberal and progressive interchangeably, which probably annoys a lot of other leftists) and a 'centrist' (Maybe I'd be Center-Left in Europe, but DEFINITELY NOT in America) due to my opposition to punching Nazis and Antifa violence (I feel uncomfortable saying 'FUCK ANTIFA!' as I feel that there's more to Antifa than just the nazi punching and property destruction that people love to paint Antifa as and I don't want to misrepresent them, but fuck the ones who punch people and destroy property. Progressive Values 101: No Offensive Violence allowed) and the fact that I don't want to completely destroy Capitalism (I want Social Democracy. I want Universal Healthcare, Universal College, All the systemic ___ist systems destroyed, a New New Deal, and a Basic Income for when the robots take all of our jobs, but I still want businesses to exist. I still want to buy shit. I want Coca Cola, Disney, Tesla, etc to exist and make a profit. Just not own everything and buy all the politicians and run everything).

"Like many people have already mentioned, the left has a PR problem and a unity problem. Our internal problem lies in the way we fight among ourselves. The communists think the leftist capitalists are fascists and the leftist capitalists think that the communists are lunatics. This is not the only feud, but it is an important one. Imagine if both sides united? What's the worse that could happen? We would show that even though we disagree with the way a country's resources should be managed, we can unite for the greater good. The best that could happen is that we actually find the perfect answer that probably lies somewhere between communism and capitalism. Secondly we have our PR problem, and that will only be solved by making our own memes, by making our own cringe compilations, by having our own mascots, and by not smashing private property or random trump supporters. I know trump has fascist tendencies, but most of his supporters were just conned into voting for him. They found in him a different kind of politician and thought 'what's the worse that could happen?'  Also, i have one little (huge) grievance with some of the left in my country (portugal) specifically: Some people keep defending 'communist' and 'socialist' regimes just because they call themselves communist or socialist. You guys, Kim jong un is a big baby with a grenade and maduro is a fascist cunt. Maduro may be a socialist, but socialism does not mean dictatorship. Kim jong un has control over the means of production in NK but that doesn't automatically mean he is a communist, because communism is supposed to be the opposite of tyranny, which is exactly what he is, a tyrant","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"So in a sense, I enjoyed this video less than I usually do (not to say that it wasn't great, it was), but I think from reading the comments that this is because this episode was meant to change the mind of AntiFa Leftists.  So more or less I just agreed with Justine, even though I think her position needs to be coupled with real activism (in terms of being involved in passing laws and campaigns for politicians sympathetic to your views).  I have no idea if this makes me a 'centrist' or a 'Leftist' under these arbitrary guidelines, but taking a step back:  Climate change is destroying our planet, economic inequality is reaching records levels, corporate control is effectively unanimous right now, and if we want to make a difference, it means we need to start setting realistic goals with realistic actions toward those goals.  And now.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"From a Centrist point of view, this video fairly accurately represents how I feel. The Left has a growing problem of eccentricity, radicalization, and promotion of violence in the name of 'the greater good', or 'the right side of history'. Regardless of the merit of the ideas there, it has the exact image problem it deserves. I felt like I was pushed from the left, when I was attacked by radicals on my own side. That is a fucking PR nightmare, and is further compounded when people on the opposing side are actually willing to sit down, exchange in civil discourse on programs like the Rubin Report, and talk about policies, differences, and similarities. Communism worked once, and there's actually a way to get these Socialistic ideals to work? That's great, talk to me about it, don't scream it at me and pepper spray the people that don't agree.

"You've managed to capture quite brilliantly here every type of leftist in at least one trait or more in the one character here - there were points where I was thinking 'god has she been looking at my twitter recently or something?', brilliant job there. It goes without saying that every issue you raised with the left was justified. At the end of the day, the one thing we do share with the far right is that we are both vilified populist movements, and the Fascists know how to deal with that fact much better than we do. As our ideas aren't, without prior indoctrination, disgusting, we never need to go the same extents of masking our true intentions like they do, but the historical fetishism as well as alienation from the average person needs to be a prime concern.   My one criticism honestly would be that while you pointed out everything wrong, it would had been great if you had gone into more specifics about how to go from there. Don't use the hammer and sickle, I agree, but are you saying we shouldn't use any symbols? That's a perfectly valid view point, btw, and one I myself may be inclined towards, but I'm just not sure what you think here - stuff like that is what I'd had like to seen expanded more, if you get what I mean.

"While I'm 'aware of optics' and think approaching people where they are is important, I don't like the wholesale dismissal of certain things here in the name of 'optics'. The hammer and sickle, for example, is a representation of urban and rural worker unity. The USSR put it on its flag, but it's not a USSR specific symbol any more than stars are American.  (Also the USSR massively reduced the incidence of famine conditions in its region. I avoid talking about this topic with 'normies' but I think you can handle the truth, Contra: the Holodomor was a fascist propaganda spin on the last bad famine of the feudal era of Eastern Europe before it's modernisation, rather than a Communist failing or genocide attempt. Switching to Capitalism might have had similar results, except nobody else was investing in the Ukraine back then. Socialist policies saved the Ukrainian people.)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I still consider myself anti-sjw but I am in full support of genuine social justice. You have been able to actually make reasonable cases for some of the lefts talking points and doing so have convinced of many of them.   Your point about the lefts optics is spot on and I've said many times getting rid of the hammer and sickle is a great start to shifting the perception. A lot of work to fixing the view is changing the overall reaction to offensive humor and media. The left used to praise people like George Carlin, Richard Prior, and Mel Brooks but as of late has turned against humor and media they deem too reprehensible. This attitude is leading people to find it uncool to be a leftist. Everyone wants to relax a little from the real world and laugh at something offensive. People look at you guys like the puritan religious right trying to censor media in the 80's and 90's.   Their attitudes pushed more people to the left in the 2000's and now those same principles are pushing back towards the right.

"I agree, the left has a problem with outreach and image. The difficult problem with conversations about 'optics' is that they often turn into conversations about advertising, PR, anything to put old ideas into prettier packages. But consumerism is fundamentally anti-anarchist; it's about trying to control mass opinion, and prettier book covers aren't going to benefit anyone but publishing companies, tbh. Anarchism is about learning to think for yourself, rather than just swallowing superstitious myths about the state, the market, gender, etc. I don't know how to 'make' someone do that other than to show them reality. It feels like there's an inherent contradiction there: there's something funny about trying to 'sell' the proles their freedom with the same techniques ruling elites use to foster complacency. I think the answer to the left's optics problem lies somewhere in that contradiction, I'm just not sure where to find it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Eh I'm like politically around where anarcho syndicalists would be. Although for me efficiency is way more important than ideals. I want a government that ultimately leaves people to their own devices however will help people create their vision when they come up with something so they can then give back to the community that helped them prosper when they succeed, because I think it is the most efficient way of doing things. All it would take me to accept a libertarian system would be to show me the raw numbers of how much better it is than the way we are doing things now. Basically I want a good free system that works and I want it to constantly improve without a lot of suffering. I'm like super authoritarian about healthcare and education tho. Basically I say build a leftist system that isn't that isn't afraid to change even when that change may be scary like genetic engineering out all the bad genetic diseases, automating most jobs to the point that everyone has to be provided for by the state and calling out bad things that make some leftists uncomfortable (like sharia courts and etc). Its actually why I'm so attracted to anti-sjw channels. Problems are rarely addressed in meaningful ways since its all about ideals and despite there being problems in the application of those ideals, the left doesn't seem to even consider them. Tldr 'Get a working first then improve on it and don't be taken in by bias. Actually improve the lives of the common man as well as improving wealth production and eventually we can automate into utopia.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I agree with the notion that we need to be re-evaluating our tactics. In another movement, there was a guy who asked other activists whether they'd be willing to break the law for the cause. Many said yes. He then asked them if they'd be willing to go to jail for the cause. Many said yes. He then asked them if they'd wear a suit and tie for the cause, and was met with confusion. We need to be appealing to centrists, but I honestly don't know where the lines are drawn. Does a center even exist anymore?  The vitriolic rhetoric on the left frustrates me (I think the right and center are more guilty, but I'm currently more concerned about my corner), but I'm not sure if cooling down is going to help. We're at a point where saying 'triggered jokes aren't funny' is seen as 'getting triggered'. This literally happened a few days ago. No matter how calmly we tried to explain it, they just kept calling us 'triggered'. And these are people on a fairly fringe social justice cause that gets bashed on constantly. I would've thought they'd understand that they're just perpetuating what's being done to them and those they want to help, but apparently not.  And then one of them made a joke about 'laughing their gender neutral parts off', and another became defensive about gender issues. These people seem like robots, without any concept of intersectionality, and conditioned to meet any criticism with hostility without ever even considering the possibility that the critic might have a point.   Honestly, it's like talking with a creationist; their paradigm is sacrosanct. Hell, it's not like their heading is all that different; crony capitalism apologia, racism denialism, transphobia, misogyny, and the 'freedom of speech' rhetoric isn't all that different from 'teaching the controversy'. They don't see it that way, of course, but they operate in such a black and white setting that the only alternative to their vision is the destruction of [Western] civilization.

Look at where socialism has become popular: the Labour under Jeremy Corbyn, Spain's Podemos party, and Bernie Sanders.  You turn ordinary people off, not primarily when you talk about the Hegelian dialectic etc., but when you start demonising white people, ignoring problems of multiculturalism, and prioritising identity politics above economic inequality. Most ordinary, working class people are fundamentally 'small c' conservative, and so if you want to gain any ground you're going to have to have some reverence for tradition, indigenous culture, and religion.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Something something society of the spectacle, something something, 'seeming is more important than being,' something something.  On another level, I feel that creating new iconography is necessary for the movement to actually become what it wants to be. Looking into the past and appropriating its icons, while establishing a sense of history, also traps us in it. If we keep using the hammer and the sickle, whenever we do so we have to grapple with everything that comes with it. Come to think of it, what do people even mean by it?

"I have a big problem with leftists who think that the only way to establish Socialism is through violent revolution. Whether they're MLM's, Trots, Anarchists, etc., a violent revolution is entirely infeasible. Back in 1930, sure, there weren't fighter jets, drones, tanks damn near impervious to anything except a Javelin missile, smart bombs, and fully automatic 40mm grenade launchers. In the time when violent revolutions happened, the revolutionaries were on relatively the same footing as the army, armaments wise. The Cuban army didn't have tanks or fighter-bombers (if they did, it was relatively few), the Francoists didn't have tanks or planes, tanks and planes weren't even that effective during the Russian civil war. When the military can sit in the comfort of their bases and drop missiles from drones so high up you can't see them, let alone hit them with a shoulder carry anti-aircraft weapon, your revolution is doomed without large numbers of people. We all saw what happened to the Iraqi military during the first Gulf War, they got fucking steam-rolled, an army that had been fighting the Iranians for years, destroyed in weeks by the United States. A violent revolution in the third-world, maybe that's not so far-fetched, but in the Imperial core, the 'west', unless the military deserts their posts and comes to your aid, you are fucked. And hoping that the military will desert is a pipe dream. If we're going to win, it's going to be through electoral politics or a non-violent coup d'etat, such as when the Bolsheviks assumed power in the October Revolution, something only accomplishable via mass popular support  and massive strike action. Hearts and minds are extremely important, and you don't win hearts and minds by executing people without trial, however much they deserved it (looking at you Waltons).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I completely agree with what you're saying, but the thing is 'Antifa' is what you're saying here in pretty much every country in the world apart from America. Personally i've been involved in antifascist organisation for 5 years and i'd never had any negative press come to me personally until the Berkeley riots. Antifascist networks across Europe and South America have been institutions for almost a century, in America they are very new. The problem isn't with 'Antifa' (Personally i don't like this term as much, because it has recently become associated with a mess of american teenagers who don't respect the roots of the movement), it's with American Antifa. There is a difference between 'Antifa' and a Militant antifascist. One is in it for a sense of moral superiority with vaguely classist undertones, the other is in it to make a strong working class antifascist and anti-capitalist resistance that helps people through direct action in the community. THAT is what Antifascist action has been since 1936, and that's what it needs to be now more than ever.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Enjoyed the video, nicely done. I don't necessarily agree though. The left-right political division is old and useless. It's also destructive and has caused lot ot suffering. I think we need to move on. Perhaps the new division needs to be authoritarianism - non authoritarianism? For the post left-right future, we need to make some basic rules that the majority of people can stand behind. Capitalism is neither good or bad. Or maybe it's both of these things? But it's a fact that it puts food on the table for many, many people. Governments can't do that on a same scale.  So capitalism should stay, it just needs to be regulated and the profites should be more evenly distributed.  I hate large companies, when they grow too large they start to act like oppresive states and that's not good. There need to be some regulations how big a company can grow, in my opinion.  Moving into 21st century, we really need to start recognise our unique characteristics and individualities as one the most precious things about humanity. Stop thinking in terms of 'groups'. Tribalism is destructive and creates conflicts. Start thinking of people as unique individuals.  If a person is a victim of injustice, try to help that person.  Even the best systems in the world can hurt people on individual level.  Just some of my thoughts, written in haste and poor english (It's not my first or second language).

"An issue that I've noticed for years now is that a lot of academic language has been leaked out into public discourse, where it's open to all manner of misinterpretation (eg: 'The theory of evolution is just a theory'). I lowkey cringe whenever I hear 'cultural appropriation' in any context because it's a concept that's been so poorly communicated and many people who agree that it's a problem have no idea why. Like racism as institutional pressures is a concept that's been communicated fairly well so that even people who disagree that racism exists understand that racism can mean institutional racism, but I feel like this success isn't typical, especially since centrists and conservatives are so willing to misinterpret stuff. Basically I think it's important to have more human-readable documents available to the public with minimal jargon (that's also defined for them) and keep language like vampire catgirl's within closed circles.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I like this video a lot! It made me think and analyze my own and other's positions, and that's the most valuable thing. There's a weird line, and this video teases that line without ever crossing it, between tone policing (i.e. distracting from the topic at hand through critique of tone) and genuine criticism of how that tone affects people and how effective the argument is when presented that way. This is a very good and important discussion to have that usually ends up happening in the wrong place or at the wrong time, in the middle of some other point, but since this is framed as two liberals discussing the tones of their arguments, it bypasses concept of tone policing and gets right to the reasonable tone critique. This is most effective when talking to increasingly radical leftists like Tabby, of which I count myself among them, because the nature of the rhetoric can often do more harm than good, and I especially like the focus on the derision SJWs receive for being overly emotional, as well as the very true and reasonable counter that anger and emotions are the most natural and justified response to being discriminated against and disenfranchised. But in spite of that, it makes the larger and more uncomfortably true point that emotions and anger only work when you first have sympathy, or else they're just used to demonize you.  But it also lets you know the problems with tone can't really be solved using the complacent, subordinate position towards capitalism and authority Justine has, because those pretty but superfluous redesigns she comes up with to put a fun aesthetic pastiche over Marxist ideology are  just as 'not cool' as anything she criticized Tabby for. Justine doesn't know what 'cool' actually is either, and therefore is ultimately ineffective in a world where, oddly enough, due to our own history, both violent and nonviolent rebellion will always be considered 'cool' compared to that kind of pastel complacency and deference to authority.  In simple terms - this seems almost like what I'd imagine a philosophical discussion between an Antifa extremist and Elizabeth Warren would be like, where I'm sitting here more like a Bernie Sanders - less willing to buy into that authoritarian hypocrisy in the system out of Warren, but wanting a political revolution that changes the system from the inside with the only violence being done as a matter of basic self-defense, not a willingly violent social revolution like what the most extreme Antifa leftists demand. Am I satisfied when a Nazi gets punched? Hell yeah, but that punch isn't going to help beyond just giving us that taste of satisfaction and bringing that one Nazi pain. Acknowledging the difference is HUGE if we want to succeed.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I enjoyed the the video, and agree with the point. Its especially important for the left to consider their optics because they have a harder task than centrists or conservatives. Leftist ask people to look beyond their own individual circle and to empathize with people others often dismiss as terrorist and criminals But I think there where a few points Contra missed that should have been elaborated in-the way pwnge culture will always exploit you at your weakness. You can be calm as a cucumber 99% of the time. But that one time you get angry at dealing with the vast oppression, or get frustrated and leave a snarky comment, that's what you go mainstream for. That's when Bearing, or Tucker Carlson or Laci goddamed Green decide to give you attention-it's not always necessary to have ' the people' sympathetic to you to make a difference. The black civil rights movement wasn't widely liked until well after MLK died.

"So there's a lot to unpack here... I mean yeah I've met leftists like this too. And I agree that we need the centrists (as evidenced by revolutionary history; if you don't have the centrists on your side, things don't tend to end well) so yes they need to be convinced. On the other hand I think there's also value in defending extreme measures. For example, breaking shop windows can terrify centrists and backfire, but on the other hand it can be a good idea to talk to them about it and make them question why broken shop windows scare them so much.   I mean giving in to the pressure to be respectable is actually also a problem the left has had. The left in the US especially (but also elsewhere) has been kind of a bunch of pushovers for a while now. Sometimes you do need to push your own narrative rather than to compromise. The tricky part is to figure out when is the time for which strategy. (Of course that's where studying history is a good idea.) But I think right now seems like a good moment to push a bit. I mean people are starting to realise that Nazis are still a thing and kind of a terrifying thing. President Trump is a reality now. Faith in the capitalist system is the lowest it's been for decades. I can't think of a more approproate moment in my entire lifetime for leftists to be assertive.  And I mean yes, if you can keep cool while you're angry, that helps. That's true. I haven't quite figured out how to do that yet though, and it's not an easy thing to do. It's an unfair standard to place on people. I would defend emotional outburst rather than tell people that it's not useful. I mean it might not convince YouTube shitlords or other arrogant bastards but it might still affect some people who are more sympathetic to people's distress.  I'm with you 100% on the obscure philosophy nonsense and horrible unintelligible jargon point though. Also frankly I still think the best tactics would be community building, raising class consciousness and encouraging activism (while being careful about the S and C words and especially the A word. Unless they come up in conversation of course.) Political arguments are important too but they only really matter for people who are already politically conscious. They shouldn't be the first priority.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Good video, and I mostly agree with you. You didn't raise it in your video, but ideologies do not create a revolution. Communism, as defined by Marx, is an objective class movement, where the working class seek to liberate themselves from their oppressors. During revolutionary times, ideology has not been the driving factor of the working class, it has instead been driven by the desire for freedom. The left has unfortunately been plagued by idealists who romanticise violence and controversial regimes. It is possible to hold the views of Justine whilst still seeking the end goal as Tabby. Personally, I'm not fully convinced that dressing in black to intimidate and use violence if necessary to keep nazis of our streets (It is really not to be negotiated if we are to allow white supremacy and other forms of xenophobia and violence), romanticising it is unnecessary and rather counter-productive. I just really have one argument against you in this video - being that a revolution is not built on convincing people that 'socialism is better than capitalism', the masses are made revolutionary through their material conditions in society. The natural contradictions of capitalism will bring its own demise.  Your videos are just what we need. They challenge our ideas and can make us uncomfortable watching them, but you hold us and with well thought out arguments and you are able to accurately represent your opponents ideas and values. This is the pinnacle of debate, thank you so much for the videos. <3","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This video is difficult. Your frequent use of dialogue as a framing device, though dialectical af, makes it hard for such videos to make a single clear point. This is the point of course, the feeling it generates is frustration, and this can get one to think.   However, this one I found particularly difficult, since one of the characters felt closer to the intended viewpoint and so came across as preachy, especially since their smugness was built in as a character flaw.   While I agree with your criticism of the left's obtuseness and sectarianism, I think you overestimate their ineffectiveness or their unpopularity, since a lot of concrete leftist policies can be and have historically been popular. Socialising resources and democratic workplaces, these are not that hard to promote, and can at worst be called 'utopian'.   Lastly, the idea that the left needs better optics comes across as somewhat cynical to me. Actions don't literally speak for themselves, and yes this means that good publicity is important too. But still, if one sincerely believes that the left's cause is in the interest of 'the people', one should also at least somewhat believe that 'the people' can come to joing the cause of their own volition, without having to make it look cool.   In conclusion, I think fighting bad  representations of the left is more important than creating a cool version of it. In fact I think sincerity is more important than coolness. Maybe you can be both, but I don't see the point. I don't want people to be leftist solely because they find it cool. I want to see them join the left because they're motivated by love.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I would think that merely opposing fascism would mean that I am objectively antifa, whether I claim the word or not.

Cuba has led major advancements in healthcare innovation and has completely abolished illiteracy and has a lower infant mortality rate than the U.S and I could keep going..there's a reason that third world national liberation movements ascribe to the concept of socialism/communism and for some white first worlder to castigate them on that is completely egregious specially coming from a privileged position such as hers.

We need to drop the classist jargon for sure, but I take issue with this video's insinuation that we can win hearts and minds by winning the image war. Fascism is alluring and sexy by design, and accepting their ideas requires much less mental discomfort (because they don't really want to change all that much, structurally). Waging war over image is just playing their game.  Our advantage is that we've actually correctly diagnosed the problems in the world and know how to fix them. If we start DOING that, there's no way they can match us. Things like creating workplace autonomy through radical unions, or building mutual aid networks. We will win hearts and minds by creating example after example of how direct action based on real working class solidarity actually makes the world a better place.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"[OK so LONG ASS ATTEMPT AT A SYMPATHETIC VAGUELY MARXIST CRITIQUE OF THIS RATHER COOL VIDEO (READ AT YOUR OWN RISK)] So i have read your pinned comment too and i get what you mean : fascist propaganda is effective because it's simple, 'bad ass' and based on prejudices (mostly white) people have and it adapts to the latest cultural fashion, while leftist propaganda does not often do that (or when it does, it is actually centre-left politics IMO). Not only does the left needs to become 'cooler' as you put it, but i would add it needs to move beyond soviet posters. Not that i am against, I think they are rather stylish and have nice colors sometimes, but I have noticed (at least online) is that the people who share it are *already* convinced by the necessity of a revolution. It does not touch the heart of your average person.   In the other hand, i think there is a reason WHY these symbols are so important. They represent the height of a struggle in the past, and the desire to reach the same result in the future : a world free of fascism, capitalism and imperialism, where everyone's needs are met. So i don't think the left should give up on the hammer and sickle and the like, but rather : -reappropriate them (in the like of 'laborwave stuff')  -most importantly : EXPLAIN THEM. most people have a nasty view of communism because of capitalist propaganda. i'm not saying it's easy to open your eyes to the reality of capitalism, but i think an *organized* working class (call me old fashioned, but the centralized party that is still able to criticize itself and learn form its mistakes (maoist style) is still the best way to achieve this) could have the power to grow its support base by printing GOOD leftist newspapers (both online and offline)  and also teaching its supporters to NOT BEHAVE LIKE PRICKS online (because indeed, the aesthetics of your average SJW is 30% queer (loving that as a bi girl) but also 30% 'i'm right because i'm oppressed' and 40% CRINGE.).  -adapt them to what people will relate to. Lenin and Marx were great, we need to read their books, but people of color might be more touched by the Black Panther Party or Francis Fanon. LGBT+ folks might care too if you mention radical queer groups who tried to bring together marxism and LGBT struggles. same if we mention everything that was achieved for women under socialism (and is still being done is zones of India that are controlled by the red guerrilla as i write)   It would also make street level antifascism more effective because a) people would understand the necessity of punching nazis and b) an organized party would prevent the white working class from falling for fascist rethoric by providing them the militant and theorical tools they need. Many communists would agree that street level antifascism is necessary in the sense that it is the chemo against the cancer of fascism, but as always, prevention is key.    All of this would be a lot more effective than memes than non-leftists either don't get or are afraid of. Memes can be good propaganda but you need a political and artistic subtlety that a lot of online activist lack. you can actually see that, weirdly enough on... reddit. WELL not /pol obviously, but r/communism101, even though it has its problems, is one of the few places on the internet where people who are curious about communism and other left-wing ideologies without (yet) 100% agreeing with it can get an answer without getting straight-up capitalist propaganda  or getting scolded by pretentious assholes. you also have a few folks like Usul, a French youtuber who makes leftist content that is relatable because it tackles contemporary issues while also using older ideological toolkits (like materialistic analysis)   which brings me to the probem of the semi-public nature of the internet : leftists share content between themselves than makes sense to them, but someone who stumbles upon it while lacking the 'rich points' so to speak might be bewildered. that's why i have a tough love relationships to red twitter / tumblr / tumblr : you can get interesting facts and debates, but i don't like most of the content because it is, once again, made for people who are already part of the community! it indeed turns communism into a subculture, which is the opposite of what it is supposed to be! anyways if you are interested, Red Guards Austin made a piece that talks about this called ' On identity opportunism'. seriously i wish every pseudo SJW who is on socialist twitter for the likes would read it.

Fascists aren't a genuine political force currently - they genuinely don't pose any more of a threat than 'radical Islamists'. They could, and we should be aware of it, but now is not the time for violence. As Contra points out, now is the time for optics. Now is the time to make clear how dangerous nationalism is. Now is the time to make progressive ideals look cohesive, peaceful, and attainable within the American ethos.

I will say though that the only disagreement I have is that these conversations are primarily, if not exclusively, being had online so regardless of how aloof you enter them in defence of yourself or marginalised groups upset and anger (or being 'triggered' ) is almost always projected on you anyway (especially true if you're a person of colour or a trans person or a woman). Even when you inject humour into your comments it's either read as hostile, condescending, or taking as entirely serious.  There is certainly a percentage of leftists who overwhelm whoever they're talking to with academic terms and refuse to accept anything short of a violent revolution. I find myself being the latter more often that I wish, usually in my more hopeless moments. That said, I would guess that most leftist still participate in elections even when there are no good options, still work to the extent that they can within the  system to push socialist ideals.  In fact, I would say that the most effective leftist (in regards to motivating and uniting groups) recently in the UK has been Jeremy Corbyn.

The main takeaway is obviously leftists should care more about optics, but it says nothing on how to actually IMPROVE those optics, except in a joke about Miles Davis.  I suppose since this is a philosophical/artistic video, there's not supposed to be any real answer (or at least that the answer is complex and not straightforward), but it's clear the main purpose of this was to critique the left, and the entire time watching this, it felt you yourself were unclear where your point of critique actually stands...which lends itself to the question of 'why make the video in the first place.'  If Justine really is a stand-in for you, and if all she has to offer to this is derisive nitpicking with no real solutions OR sympathy to the cause except when it's convenient for her...then why are you talking?  I don't mean to be rude when I say this, by the way.  I do actually agree with you on all the facets leftists should be criticized on.

"The left today has lost empathy for the average person in the street, and is more concerned with ideological one-up-man-ship, and demonizing anyone that doesn't 1000% toe the orthodox 'social justice' line, than it is with practical political goals, or with building broad support. And an eternally outraged ideology, where *every* mis-step is a deal-breaker is a really shitty sales pitch.   We're afraid to acknowledge the massive, unprecedented progress we're made in terms of racial, gender, LGBT equality, and public attitudes to that stuff, within the last few decades, for fear of forfeiting the right to call people racist, or misogynist, or bigots, when they say something we don't like. But ironically (and I'm very aware people hate hearing it, but it's fucking true- or at the very least it's a significant contributing factor) by constantly calling people 'bigots' and 'racists' for petty shit, we're pushing them into the arms of *actual* racists and bigots.   But this shit is old news. 'Cult of outrage' and all that. The left doesn't *want* to change, and it doesn't *want* to appeal to a wide support base- at least not more than it wants the approval of existing leftists; the back-patting we get from preaching to the choir is more important to us than getting support from the average person in the street (who's probably an evil racist misogynist *anyway*, so fuck em; why would we *want* their vote). So we keep chasing a bunch of unattainable abstractions, and going on about how 'oppressed' everyone is in objectively the most equal era in history.

"Contra, I know this is a wall, but I promise its worth it.  As somebody who has watched your critique of the left evolve from them beig 'joyless and humorless' to suggestions for turning ourselves into 'ice-cold motherfuckers' (which I think is absolutely valid) without becoming neoliberal shills, can I make a suggestion? Their are currently three youtubers who make videos on political economy and society from libertarian socialist perspectives: Libertarian Socialist Rants, Badmouse Productions and Mexie (check them out if you haven't already, they're incredible!). Together, the four of you hold opinions that are the closest to mine on Youtube. So I was wondering if the future of these four channels could coincide from time to time? I'm not talking about collabs, maybe cameo appearances in each others videos where the aesthetics, tone and content are collectively decided and all of you enrich each other's contents like this? Think of how a simple explanation of what libertarian socialism/anarchism is presented through deeply ironic tone like yours could draw more people. Maybe this way, that network of four channels could increase (You've already collabed with Lindsay Ellis Hbomb, etc) to incorporate a huge network of leftists collectively putting their input in each others videos (the libsoc way, baby!!). This might be a fantastic tactic when it comes to centrists. Just a thought.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'The left' is too nebulous a concept to critique. This 'leftist' is simultaneously an anarchist, a marxist-leninist tankie, an antifa 'sjw' and a pseudo-marxist centrist liberal. She's a walking contradiction, which is slightly confusing.   Marx has really important criticisms about capitalism. Without that, the left has no substantial basis other than 'equality guys'. This isn't enough - we need strong economic arguments, which we have.   There have been efforts on the part of people like David Harvey to simplify critiques of capitalism, but you can't separate these concepts from the theory. Theory requires some degree of thinking unfortunately.   In some respects, marxists are pessimistic about revolution in the first world. This is because things aren't bad enough yet - we still are able to exploit the cheap labour of workers in the third world and we are yet to significantly automate labour. But this is Marx's dialectic - class struggle will inevitably arise out of poor material conditions. It's just a question of when and why.   If suddenly a marxist movement arises outside of a time of crisis, great! I have noticed an uptick in interest in Marx on youtube, meme pages (even ironically) and some politicians who have even aligned themselves with marxists before are becoming popular (e.g Jeremy Corbyn).   The socialist ice is thawing, people are starting to read theory and not accepting the prevailing ideology as commonsensical.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
