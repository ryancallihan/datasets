"You know, it's like when Trump first got elected, and was just talking about a Muslim band, and people come out, in every state, in fucking droves, to protest. But later on, once the Muslim ban actually passed, people were like 'yawn. The last season of Game Of Thrones is about to start. Ain't nobody got time to protest'. Oh, and people were super concerned about 'kids in cages' for all of four minutes.( But at least now the Democrats are doing something about that.)   What I'm trying to say is: considering lawmakers continue to strip away reproductive and LGBT rights in the name of their iron-age myths. People need to get unbored with atheist activism real fucking quick.   This is why we continue to, and will always continue to, lose elections. No matter how 'woke' we like to think we are. There's nothing that screams privilege more then the option to be apathetic and not stand up. Anyone out there think the Civil Rights Movement was an optional, trending, passing fad? I don't think so. What does it take to keep people interested in the good fight?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Since when did Elliot Rodger belong to any particular movement? More mental illness than ideology. It isn't unreasonable to assume that he would have become violent without the influence of PUA forums. He could have as easily been radicalized elsewhere.  Even the PUA 'pimps' themselves are self-aware enough to realize that they will more often fail at what they do than they will be successful, which is a distinct difference in the level of narcissism that Elliot Rodger's had (which was weird, because it was mental illness).  So Elliot Rodgers was someone unrelated to both sides of the ideological dispute, sort of like a bomb going off outside the discussion booth. That somehow got adopted and used as a means to blame another side within the ideological bubbles.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I discovered Contrapoints a bit ago, and it's a shame how badly you are misrepresenting TJ here.  They are not critiquing Rebecca Watson's views on anything other than claims of blackmail and burying research 'that could save lives' at this point, and they are laughing at these claims. TJ is making a parody of her rabble rousing. At this point it has already been established this groping didn't even happen. It actually has nothing to do with feminism, or Rebecca being 'a women they don't agree with.' Tj doesn't even bring up her gender.  If you didn't cut the clip mid-sentence, you'd understand it was a parody:  'And I mean like when did we all agree to just write off people who were like 'you  fuckin groped that bitch's tit when you were drunk- therefore you have no worth as a human being now. You are cast out into the wastelands to die the death you deserve.'  Right. That's not saying groping is okay. He's saying that the accusation, even if true, doesn't warrant her response.  The only thing kinda funny about all this is that Rebecca accuses a guy of being a sociopath, and Tj says even if he argues it, he's still stuck defending himself about not being a sociopath. You're pretty much doing the same thing here, and now I'm defending TJ for not supporting molestation. It's just kinda shitty when anyone misframes a clip.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

In the months, now years following trump's election they've completely and utterly disenfranchised me. They began making friends with literal fascists and even affecting some of their rhetoric to appeal to their now decidedly rightward leaning fanbase. What I believe happened was that the right saw how effective that movement was at gaining the support of young white men and essentially stole it away from the actual rational people leading it in an Internet coup. For years they couldn't get 'sjw'out of their mouths and demonized anyone who identified as a feminist, which eventually became anyone who identifies with the left at all. These fucking shitheads are absolutely toxic to every community they attach themselves to. Atheism, gaming, hell even Rick and Morty wasn't spared. Yet they have the audacity to call US toxic?

When I was going through the 'red pill rage' (to borrow from the MGTOW movement terminology) phase of exiting religious thinking they were an outlet for the feelings of anger and the hole that was left by my parents convincing me that there was a magic man in the sky. But as time went on and I came to terms with it my need for someone to agree with me disappeared. Suddenly I was only watching them for their rare science content or their discussions/interviews with scientists. But it was a phase that I quickly grew out of I guess. Part of me wants to attribute their decline in popularity is their shift from science related content that stemmed from incorrect religious assertions to dying on the hill against social justice warriors. But the other part of me knows it's because they no longer appealed to a quickly progressing fan base.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I wonder if you have the same distain for Anita and SJW 'nitpicking' nowadays. You more recent videos talk about the small, intricate nuances and differences within the left, such as that skit between a fence sitting interviewer and two transwomen arguing over victimhood. Basically acknowledging intersectionality exists. Ive seen it first hand during 2016 when a lot of white liberals didnt know or care why Hillary Clinton was popular with women of color in particular, and weren't attracted to the 'obviously better' choice, Bernie Sanders.  You also bring up cultural appropriation as a form of banal nitpicking - and interesting only use that dreadlock clip as repeat evidence. Sort of like how these edgelords kept pointing to Anita to claim that feminism is cancer. There's famous cases of white artists using and discarding black culture for their own gains. Justin Timberlake used 'Nipplegate' (a black woman's body) to boost his fame and relevancy, while Janet Jackson was the one who had to pay censorship violation fines and was banned from the Grammys, while Justin was invited to host.   Miley Cyrus clothes, dancing and singing were heavily influenced by black pop culture to get away from her Disney brand and gain a lot of fans, she dropped and disavowed her hip hop career as a crazy phase. She went back to a more 'pure and wholesome' country music style, after slamming rap, after she got the fame and money she wanted. Niki Minaj called her out for using black culture as a discarded costume, and cited her as a reason why black female artists struggle to get recognition because white female artists take and sell blackness as an exotic flair. She wasn't the one to invent twerking, for example, but its heavily attributed to her.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I started watching The Amazing Atheist  in early high school after I became an atheist myself. I loved, and still love, his earlier videos, which thoroughly debunked the christian nonsense in a hilarious and rational way. His content was super abrasive and induced some real self examination as someone who intellectually very much resonated with the 'SJW triggered feminist' camp, and I'm grateful for that. Because we both grew up in the swampy southern US (southeast TX/Louisiana) I also felt like I could relate to his worldview much more intimately- things that are considered normal down here, especially concerning childcare, are met with pearl clutching and hand wringing by people who were raised in the more northern US. It was cool to see someone else who felt like that extreme response was too dramatic. I also appreciated his lengthy critiques of girl teen pop culture, which as a self-declared woke not-like-other-girls kind of person felt refreshing and validating. However, I do agree with this critique of most of his recent content. It feels like he ran out of things to talk about, and embraced that anti-SJW mindset a bit too much to keep getting views or whatever.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Holy shit. Holy shit. You just answered what I've been asking myself for the last few years. About 7 years ago I got into my atheist identity (or thats what I thought) through thunderf00t, theamazingatheist, and armored skeptic. I think it stemmed from my 'daddy' issues and untreated PTSD (a long with a slew of other mental illness issues). My best friend is such a fucking hero because never once did he avoid engaging me on the politics of feminism, and we sometimes would end up mad at each other for a week after I would ask dumb questions like 'feminism has the world feminine in it so it must be about only women's rights'. However we never stopped, and he I think is what really pulled my head out my ass on that issue. I used to think Anita Sarkeesian was the devil and the face of feminism. I was so wrong, and it wasn't out of hatred. I thought I was a women's rights advocate. I grew up in a house of women, a single mother who I loved dearly and my little sister who was my best friend as a child. I just thought it was 'modern' feminism, but its not and these assholes like TJ skew the arguments by inserting little bits of fact, and on their other subjects they were credible. But I just grew out of that through real experience and now I'm proud to be a strong feminist. The women's march had even more of an impact on me. It was the single most powerful event I have ever seen. I'm glad I'm not that way anymore, and my mom has played such a huge thankless role in my life that it took me till I was 21 to really appreciate. The strength that women showed me changed my mind. I'm also really glad that you took the time to explain how people like me became disenfranchised with this weird conservative atheist fad.

"The phenomenon is common in every free-love community. When you produce a sexual market, men realize that the more sexist they are, the more attractive they become. It's a law of nature. This propels misogyny to the top of atheist and Marxist circles. One extremely effective solution is to have draconian sex-restrictions, like religious organizations, celibate clergy, etc, or else only trust really old men and women. I mean, Chomsky old. You can't indoctrinate women to not sleep with misogynists because they're already attractive just by their fascist nature, and indoctrinating against them just makes them even more attractive. They already have an advantage because they are hateful and selfish, which means, to young people, just that much more tasty masculine domination. You can't indoctrinate men to avoid bourgeois women, because they will manipulate them into an erection using bourgeois affectations. This is extremely problematic for left-atheism, which is why I think sex-restrictions make sense. If that sounds too ridiculously right-wing and authoritarian, at least try to keep the sexy guys and gals out of leadership positions, by instituting clown-suits as mandatory for leadership, or something like that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As an atheist I always thought atheism as a movement was the dumbest goddamn shit ever. How do you create a movement out of 'not believing in X'? The reality very quickly became apparent: Atheists ranged from far-left to far-right, and we actually ended up having a lot more in common with religious people (or at least groups which may be religious but also actually believe in A Thing) than we did with each other. I'd much rather associate myself with a far-left Christian who cares about equality and such than with a Thunderf00t or Dawkins or etc. who happens to also not believe in god, but does not desire a society anything like the one I want to live in. The Christian may believe in silly stuff, but if the end result is that he or she wants a society basically the same as I do, they're my peer far more than any Dawkins-esque anti-feminist/anti-Muslim is. Even though we may both happen to not believe in god. This was the fundamental flaw of Dawkins and his 'Brights' attempt.

"I think the biggest problem with feminism is that it now is relatively mainstream. While every movement always has lunatics, once the movement becomes mainstream, those lunatics get louder because their audience grows - and they become more relevant because of the echoes of opposition.   That said, the reaction of the sceptic community isn't surprising. What was their MO when they actually weren't antifeminist morons? They looked at the most stupid thing the most stupid theists said and made fun of it. This was their approach to discourse. It never actually was about making any points but about  ridiculing the opposition. I also remember that the audience always seemed very devout to their new idols as well. I remember when I organized a talk about the role of religion in society with a prominent member of the German branch of the new atheist movement - there were quite a few people who didn't visit any other event we organized, were very familiar with the invited atheist and echoed pretty much all he said religiously. That was when I noticed that this movement had a rather problematic side.  I think that there is another layer to this. Armored Sceptic rose to prominence by making fun of the fallacies of some evangelical christians and conspiracy theorists, but when he shifted his attention to feminism, Sargon of Akkad became prominent due to AS's prominence. Sargon then changed the tone of the debate with 'this week in stupid' while The Amazing Atheist somehow also got a big audience - and that guy is brutish rabulism personified. Furthermore, the more rabulistic the sceptics became, the less sceptic they became to their own assumptions. The divide between SoA and thunderfood was because thunderfood agreed to some left positions. In a truly sceptic community, this would never have been an issue.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hatred of women is real. Workplace discrimination and harassment are real. Still 'privilege' is a seriously counterproductive way of addressing the problem - not being discriminated against, harassed or assaulted is not a 'privilege' granted to a few, it's a right that everyone has and that everyone should respect. You can't argue that everyone should have a 'privilege,' or it's not a privilege anymore. That way of framing the problem presents feminism as a movement that wants to take something AWAY from men, rather than presenting it as something women, as human beings, deserve. The impression is given that feminism will result in men having less, rather than the truth of the matter, which is that everyone will have more.  The problem with the reactionaries is that they're arguing dishonestly. Just as Weinstien isn't 'all men,' nor is he representative of the way most men behave, most feminists don't act like the self-righteous caricatures being used to lampoon the entirety of feminism. We NEED awareness of the way women are treated, and if we are to move closer to a just society, action must be taken.  But it does harm to a righteous cause to present the argument in such a way that the vast majority of men will reject it out of hand as hostile.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

But a lot of them seem to have lost their minds, even within the nontheistic communities atheist are considered jokes who are just as bad as the people they claim to be against.  Which is why more and more people tend to lean away from atheism and more towards agnosticism or not indentify at all because they don't want to be associated with these fuckwards.

"Well, MAYBE feminism did not destroy atheism... I think that the 'atheist' community was shattered because at the end of the day, atheism is not a philosophy that informs a unified body of political theory. Thus, as soon as the 'new atheists' were done talking about how moronic religion is, people started moving on to other societal subjects.  This inevitably resulted in the division of the 'community' along political lines. I myself am a Marxist, and Marxism is of course an atheist political philosophy to it's very core. So, I enjoyed many of the sceptic YouTube channels debunking crazy creationists. But when some of those sceptic atheists started to spout right wing ideologies I was like 'whoop, well this is where we part ways. It was fun while it lasted, but time to move on!' So in my opinion the schism was bound to happen sooner or later. Feminism just turned out to be the issue that was the catalyst. It could just as well have been economic theory.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I think the reason the movement died. 1 infighting. 2 Just as you said people got bored of the topic. 3. Political differences became more of a obstacle then common ground coalition building. Since the three main problems were not resolved ultimately the movement lost momentum. This happens in the left and right where purist demand perfection refuse to work with others. The movement becomes stale because the drive is lost. Not trying to work on common ground issues to move forward.     To be honest atheism was always going to have a tough time as a movement. Since we are all more then just atheist. We are left and we are right also the various ideologies in between and to the far corners. So not really shocked the movement collapsed.  Was feminism the reason it failed not completely it was a combo of the right vs left issue. There are right wingers and left wingers in atheism. These Ideologies clash and its a obstacle atheist need to figure out how to overcome.  My suggestion have common ground position that both right and left support. For me my biggest concern when it comes to religion is theocracy. Also theocratic laws that undermines freedom and abuses people.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I think they do it to try to make me regret voting for God-Emperor Trump five-hundred and eighty-seven times using dead people's IDs (and then turning around and campaigning for restrictive voter ID laws that disproportionately affect poor and minority groups) by trying to make me want affordable healthcare.

"Having been around at the time, two observations on the 'golden age' of internet atheism:  1) At no point were The Amazing Atheist or Thunderfoot ever worth following - the former is an unfunny wannabe comedian with a  'schtick', while the latter, despite his academic credentials, has only ever produced videos of snarky nitpicking lacking the educational quality of his more talented peers, and revelled in his regular intellectual 'defeat' of a poorly educated child, only to have his ass handed to him at the first time of asking, by the flimsiest of libertarians.  2) The 'new atheist' community was never as intellectually rigorous and rational as it liked to pretend to be, even at the start.  Around ten years ago, I (having a postgraduate education in Classics) served for a while as the 'resident historian' for an online atheist group debating creationists. After about six months, several members of the group contracted belief in the 'Jesus Myth Hypothesis' (a conspiracy theory based on an idea disregarded by actual historians decades ago, as it was incompatible with our improved understanding of ancient myth), and I buggered off once I go sick of hearing how the opinions of peer-reviewed scholars were unimportant, my field of academia was 'invariably skewed to a pro-christian worldview', and that making gish gallops and ignoring complex rebuttals is perfectly fine when you're the one that's doing it, and it's in support of an idea confirms something that you already believe.  Numerous internet atheists endorse the Jesus Myth Hypothesis.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"RE: Thunderfoot and LadyButts  I think you have mischaracterized Anita's position, and thus caricatured TFoot's disagreement.  The series is called 'Tropes vs Women in Video games' and it aims to point out 'harmful stereotypes' and other such things. Sarkeesian is not simply observing a pattern, she is an advocate. Her claim, both explicit and implicit, is that Butt Sway is inaccurate, a stereotype added in to titillate the 'Presumed straight male audience'. TFoot's response is that women DO have exaggerated hip sway compared to men, because of a different bone structure, and while the character may be attractive, that walk is reasonably natural.   You essentially took the position that TFoot was saying that men do not in fact like looking at butts, whereas he was responding to the claims of Sarkeesian that the butt motion in question was somehow unrealistic or inaccurate, and also that it was harmful to have that claimed inaccuracy.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I agree with a lot of your points, here are some that i don't.  The data actually proves that the wage gap is non-existent, and that there is not systemic sexism in hiring.  Does that mean neither of those things happen?  Of course they do, but it is not systemic.  Second, I think that them bashing extreme feminism is just as important as you bashing them for their reaction.  Both are over the top, however, extreme feminism is the one getting all the air time, and the one that is making policies, and that is bad, very bad.  All extremism ever does, is divide and then conquer and you can already see it happening.  Men cannot talk about men's issues without feminist protesting, calling them all sexist and rapist and rape apologist, it is insane.  I dated a feminist, she literally believed that all men were rapist, but that most men barely control it.  It got to the point that I never would instigate any kind of touching or sex because when men do it, per her, it is misogynist and patriarchy.  No, extremism needs to be called out over and over and over to the point of boredom to tears because these are the voices that are being heard and making policy.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I want to like this video, you do seem pretty reasonable and able to present yourself, you seem abel to make videos interesting, which is good, I think that gives it a better ability to reach across the isle, which is something desperately needed. But I'm ticked off by what I perceive as misrepresentations. None of which I'm particularly outraged over, but I'm a miserable keyboard warrior with nothing better to do with my life than to write long comments on the internet hoping that someone will care, so here goes.  I get that your opening montage of youtube atheists being jackasses is supposed to be exaggerating, but why call Thunderf00t the 'self-appointed leader and champion of the atheist community'? What's that even based on? I've alway seen him as slightly apart from the rest of the community. I get that he kind of a douchebag, but I can't remember ever getting a sense that he thinks he leads anyone. Why do you associate other anti-SJWs/anti-feminists/social right people/whatever you wanna call them with him?  I'd say that I agree with Thunderf00t the bit you played of him responding to Rebecca Watson. As a person who's often in the middle of this social divide, shit like that is a fucking massive turnoff. It's immature, toxic, counterproductive and not funny, and she apparently felt it was worth uploading. How is Thunder thinking that that's stupid jackass behaviour supposed to make him look bad?  I get that calling the Drunken Peasants Podcast a 'conference call to critique Rebecca Watson' is exaggeration, but still it ticks me off. I will however agree, that whilst I like DP, I think it ought to stay away from anything that has any chance of being productive, because it's a format that seems set up to fuck with any chance to have good relations with the people you interact with. It's a format that promotes instant responses, constant interruption, kneejerk-reactionary side-choosing, group-repetition and embellishment, etc, etc, everything is a circus, no one reflects on anything, and often just create toxicity. That being said,I think it's worth granting them some leniency, it's a stupid, laid-back podcast, I think that what they said about Rebecca was bad, but too harmless to be worth anything in a video like this. Of course they lingered on it for a long time, that's because it's more about them hanging out, bullshitting and going on tangents than it is about the things they watch.

"Very minor detail but I kinda get stuck on this a lot, wonder if some atheists could elaborate.  How is it not a belief system?  Its definition is to not believe in gods - it is a thing defined by a limitation to what your beliefs can be.  Like all the religions are.  It's clearly not a religion since it doesn't have like, membership rituals and holy places and whatnot - all stuff that contributes to the vague meaning of what is a religion.  But a belief system isn't that, it's far more basic and straightforward - a category of your beliefs.  They can be no beliefs, and it's still a category of what your beliefs are (besides which this definition of atheism doesn't necessarily mean 'no beliefs' so long as they aren't god-based ones).  Being as atheism is based entirely upon this categorization of someone's beliefs (for them not to be god-based), what's wrong with calling it a belief system?  What's even the jump to defend against that?  I don't get it.  People seem to react to it like it's some kind of insult or accusation.  This just puzzles me.  It's surely only meant to be a useful way of meaning a rough sum of one's beliefs?  Is there some kind of history here that I'm unaware of, like someone stumbling across a hate word they don't know is a hate word?  Like, how unnecessarily difficult would it make maths if we insisted that nobody could call zero a number?  It may have an essentially different quality to other numbers, but it's still useful to call it the thing that those other numbers are, for like... doing maths.  In the same way, with a thing that doesn't necessarily even mean 'no beliefs' (but could and often does), why not call that a 'number' like the other 'numbers'?  Just because it's (probably) a zero?  This may have been an incredibly clumsy metaphor (kinda typical of me) but I'm just trying to illustrate the point here, get at why it's useful to have a term for these categories.  Alternatively perhaps, what else do you want people to call it?  There wants to be a way to say this, so what way would be appropriate?  I've heard it suggested I use 'worldview' but that term's too umbrella (aside from being a bit flowery and pretentious-sounding) - it covers politics and other such stuff like that.  You could use 'worldview' to describe how one atheist is against a particular economic principle that another atheist is campaigning for, so no it's not useful in the same way.  You might as well use the word 'mindset' if you're gonna go that wide.  No; I would want a term to mean (and only mean) the same thing that 'belief system' means for all the other sets of things that people believe in (if it really, really does have to be a different term in the first place which again, I don't understand the aversion).  And then I'll use that term for everything, not just atheism, and drop 'belief system' entirely.  Heck, I don't care what words it's called!  Just want for there to be a term in the first place, that's all.  Or is there something I'm not seeing here that makes having such a term problematic at the core?  If so I'd definitely like to understand that.  Still really curious what the pricklyness around the term is about to begin with.  That'd probably shed a lot of light on this thing that's just... been picking at my brain for ages now.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I followed some feminists whose main shtick is criticizing feminism, especially pop feminism but they also tend to call out terfs, serfs and other radicals - or just in general people who identify as feminists who are just plain wrong about something. Too bad many of them are working people with lives of their own so they don't really make much content or find the time to update their blogs anymore.   In general, the best analysis of feminism that I've encountered has been from other feminists, academic or otherwise. It's taught me some interesting ways to reflect on not only feminist arguments in general but on my own knee-jerkish reactions to certain topics. I guess it just shows you that in order to properly critique something, you need a deeper understanding of the topic in the first place.  The biggest thing that baffles me is how otherwise rational people tend to drop to the same fallacious methods that they spend the rest of their time complaining about, like religious apologists cherry picking or strawmanning their arguments.   Funny thing is, I used to be like that too but not nearly to such an extreme (I've always been, politically, either moderate or on the left, depending on which scale you use). I've  for the most part always been able to step back and change my views when facing evidence that contradicts my previously established beliefs. Yet somehow, being more scientifically minded has made me more accepting of social issues and theoretical frameworks used to analyze them. Seems to a lot of people, being rational pro science TM is mostly a way to shield their views from self-reflection, because they are rational pro-science TM so there's no reason to actually critically measure their own stance or arguments.  Many of the people often mentioned in these alt-right or anti-SJW crowds tend to be people I used to like, or whose intelligence I otherwise would respect, but hypocrisy is a huge turn off and it becomes hard to take these people seriously even when I agree with them.   I'm glad I found your channel though - much like AronRa and Dick Coughlan, you've quickly become one of those voices of reason I rarely find myself disagreeing with, and you've managed to even help me reflect and change some stances I've held until very recently.

Granted this is only my limited experience, but I have just never met anyone who even remotely resembles the misandrist stereotype.   Really, though this vilification happens to any group that tries to challenge the status quo. Giving blacks the right to vote was thought to destroy the fabric of society and end life as on Earth as we know it. Allowing gays to marry would destroy the family and life on Earth as we know it. Transgender people will use bathrooms to molest children and destroy life on Earth as we know it.

"eh....Atheism as a movement died because it's enemies lost power. The Christian Right has been on the downturn, and without strong enemies, they turned inward like every other religious movement.  Sectarianism was nigh inevitable.    I would argue it was less over feminism, and more over Left Identity politics, VS anti-IDPOL.   As for the criticism, Thunderf00t talked a lot about feminism because that stuff got the most views and because he sees a lot of dodgy science coming from that area. He is focusing more on politics and pseudoscience these days. Watson does mostly politics but contributes little original stuff, and mostly goes for low-hanging fruit.

"You're more or less correct. Personally i'd put a little more blame (than you do) on the SJW Atheist side of things though. I was watching this develop in real time, and it did start from the hijacking of the new atheist/sceptic movement from extremely pc full on trigger warning and stfu you cis gendered white priviledged scum SJWs. You are of course correct in pointing out that there wasnt much meat to 'not being a Theist' so the New Atheist fad was dying. What you dont seem to understand is that what came after the death of New Atheism was a replacement of it with 2 sides which are the same people who enjoyed exhibiting their supreme intellect to educate the bewildered masses who dont understand the perrils of being a Christian, Muslim etc because they dont understand logic and science. They just found something different to explain through their supreme intellect to the bewildered uneducated masses etc. Both sides did, and one side is fed from the existence of the other side.  What i'm saying is that the essense of the issue isnt that some people dont understand that Femminsim didnt destroy atheism, but that some people enjoy believing that they're going to educate the bewildered uneducated masses through their supreme intellect. The problem is that these are the people who dont want so much to read a few books or actually change anything in real-life, they're just doing it to feel better about themselves. That was satisfied for a little while by new atheism, now it's satisfied by identifying with one of these two sides. I find this all a waste of time more than anything.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I totally agree with your points about nonsense within the feminist side (as a feminist myself, I recognize that it's always the struggle of progressives to be self critical).  I don't hate Anita-- I see her as a useful tool to occasionally use to demonstrate something really obvious and banal to someone who has never thought about it.  But the #killallmen thing is clearly a joke making fun of videos accusing feminists of trying to destroy men/society.  Maybe you were using this as a sarcastic example, but just so long as we're having a nuanced conversation, I thought I'd add this.  I also think that there is some good feminist discourse pushing the narrative around within the feminist movement.  Like, there's the stuff about terfs and swerf, and ridding feminism of it's old ghosts.  There's the ongoing sex positive/sex negative discussion (not meaning all sex is bad, which is a stupid argument,, but meaning, what parts of sex can or even should be criticized: porn? rape culture? how far do these criticism extend into the bedroom before they are just as bad as patriarchal sex norms?).  There are discussions about what is and isn't rape culture when we're looking at/writing/creating porn. There are discussions about white feminism, ally ship, the role of male feminists, exclusion of men, and the like.  There are discussions about toxic masculinity and male oppression as it relates to intersectionality, and what a feminist response to this looks like.  There are discussions about Marxism, and how economics and feminism may or may not influence each other. Overall, the discussion of some of these can be more hostile than I think it needs to be, but they are happening, constantly.  I also think they tend to focus on individuals more than ideas, which tends to be bad, and focus on who is 'in' and who is 'out' rather than on the more intellectually challenging but more rewarding discussion of what we want to achieve in our lives/society/the world and how to do it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Got mixed fees & thoughts about Sarkeesian, but fucking hell.  Try finding some vanilla porn, most of it is crappy fantasy shit where getting pity sex or some woman really really wanting the guy's body when she shouldn't, ooh la la...or rather yawn.  But the bulk of it is emotional manipulation, exploiting power dynamics (I don't care about enticing random person into sex work) like threatening someone's tenancy or job or leaveraging a preexisting economic vulnerability.  There is extreme sexual harassment where the character the woman actor plays gives in.  Frankly some of the 'Sis Loves Me' channel is like watching a RedPill fantasy which is actually pretty instructive of how ineffective TheRedPill really is.  On Pornhub, there is a 'Rough Sex' category, but not a 'Kink' category & that was the straw that finally broke the camel's back for me.  Even the 'For Women' category is predominantly just much nicer male orientated porn where the actors appear to be respectful of each other & considerate, yet of course the camera is very much focused upon the woman.  But like the rest of that site, uploaders will tag their uploader with obviously incorrect categories & 'For Women' is one of them that is frequently abused.  It's no wonder that subreddits like /r/chickflixxx exist but many of the women subscribers there have been complaining how shitty male orientated porn has been increasingly posted there.  Most porn on offer is incredibly formulaic as well.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Drunken Peasants had several feminists on the show to talk about their views (kudos for digging up that early episode of DP, one of my favs -- also: BRETT KEANE!).   Also, you're both right and wrong about feminism destroying the New Atheism.  People did get bored AND the conference circuit and outlets for atheist thought did get taken over by politically correct bullshit.  On the other hand, I completely agree that YouTube atheism and the politically correct counterwave (which arose around GamerGate) got cleverly co-opted by Alt-Right goons and YouTube noobs who capitalized on the outrage as a way to bring people over to their side (and ultimately elect their Dear Leader).  I mean, I want to like this video, but you're just not representing the situation (or the arguments you critique) fairly, or at least not with the nuance you want feminism to be represented with.

"The biggest problem with the entire SJW movement, as a movement, at least in its modern Internet manifestation, is that it operates on too many premises that are simply too absurd to defend explicitly, yet still act as if they were true. The most encompassing way to describe those sets of premises is basically as the underlying assumption that members of demographics that are perceived as historically oppressed are beyond reproach and above sin by the simple virtue of their belonging to said demographics. And as long as people operate on such self-evidently absurd notions as if they were true, there simply cannot be too harsh of a criticism of such a convoluted mindset. And it's really pointless to dwell on whatever valid points those people may occassionally make, because they are not meant to serve as a part of some honest discussion, but merely to advance their agenda. And until they are demoralized and this entire mindset is discredited from the public discourse the same way as Young Earth Creationism is discredited in scientific circles, the loud voices of Thunderf00t, Sargon, and The Amazing Atheist,(none of whom,  BTW, to my knowledge, is  self-described as 'right wing' nor can be objectively desribed as such unless 'right wing' is a code word for not having your head stuck up your ass)whatever their other flaws might be(and they do, like the rest of us), remain a vital part of the public discourse, to whomever may be concerned with those issues.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is a dishonest video. Either the guy is purposely misstating what thunderfoot has said or didn't bother listening in the first place and just assumed. So take the tropes in video games BS that Anita mentions. Thunder never claimed that women are not sexually provocative is many of them. What he did say was that BOTH sexes are because sex sells, and that Anita is simply is only focusing on it when it shows female characters while ignoring it as it applies to men - a double standard.  The very start of this video is just hating on thunder for no reason. Thunder never he hinted at pretending to be a leader of atheism. He is just an atheist with an opinion and Contrapoints is getting all butthurt about it. Also thunderfoot didn't say he didn't care about gender issues. He does and since feminism not only fails to show how they are being considered 2nd class citizens in a patriarchy, that they are not for equality, but simply hate men and play the victim when people question their motives or logic. The anti-feminist videos that I've seen from athiests such as thunder, had no problem with equality for those cultures/societies which really need it rather than women with 1st world countries making feminism about entitlements.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Also, see:   Skepticon then and now.  Atheism + FreethoughtBlogs  Feminism was part of the destruction of the Atheist community thanks to their irrational agenda that targets the wrong side and irrelevant to the focus of atheism by pretty much making it all about them and whatever they considered oppressive aka non straight white males. This ultimately divided the atheist community into a community that resembles a community full of angsty SJW whiners who try to look counter culture by saying no to religion. The community is part of the butt in of all jokes by these 'thug life' videos. Being 'progressive' used to mean something good back then.  I theorize it has a lot to do with attempting damage control for such shitty career choices in social justice related degrees. There was so much potential for the atheism community.

The fact that atheists cannot be grouped outside of their simple disbelief in gods, that it's a politically leftist agenda that you're adding to it, is proof that feminism has most definitely destroyed atheism.

"You think people 'Only' look at examples like Anita Saarkessian, the radical feminist that slander the whole of the movement. But you miss the bigger picture; its ideological aproach.   What we see is feminist in the ONU promoting a model that excludes the fair treatment of men regarding rape, in India even abolishing in law the concept that men can be raped. Feminist in UK supressing important information regarding domestic violence to favor women leaving men and children victims excluded. Feminist in Canada attempting to censor free speech by acusing people of harrasment over twitter comments. Feminist in Argentina who assault violenty the catholic church. Feminist in Sweden who push children into gender indentity issues for political gain. GamerGate, and the list goes on, and on, and on.   What we see here aren't 'a few radicals' but the constant radicalization of diferent groups by an ideology that has gone without a formal and deserved rebutal for a long time in the public medium.   To put it simply feminist vision of 'equality' is based on the presuposition that women are treated worse or with 'less liberty' than men by society and those who hold power . If you deny it, it could be said you contradict the bases feminist founders like Simone de Beauvoir, and that you are part of the system 'He' has implemented, thus working against equality. In short, the ideology promotes the idea that if you don't believe the idea of the patriarchy, you are against equality, a misogynist.   You even do this in the video, by assuming that the diferences in representation on STEM fields are due to discrimination, when most can be explained other ways. Hell, even in the study you use in your video: 'Harmful Workplace Experiences' there are some presupositions about what is 'harmful', and label things like 'Unwanted Sexual attention' or 'sexual cohersion' (flirting) as harrasment which may not necesary be the case.  Things men  or women do not report as 'Unwanted' some of the time are presented as harmful for women. Hell, for those into psychology the categories the study presented make no sense and many categories overlap and present an a priory moral judgment. All the study seems to corroborate is that women tend to complain more about experiences that may or may not be experienced by men to the same degree.   And thats not to say that feminist haven't produced worthwhile studies somewhere, or that they haven't provided useful information about specific issues. But whatever benefit they provide will utimately reflect that bias that is shown for example in the implementation of  the way they have helped Domestic violence victims... by excluding men and boys. Even Malala Yousafzai shows this problem, which is not to say she hasn't helped her people.   But getting back at the core of the ideology, 'patriarchy' being the center of the feminist theory (and thus the movement) is demonstrably false. Each and every one if it's preceps or ideological pillars has been debunked hundreds of times by hundreds of different people. I personally preffer Karen Straughan videos to expose to laymen how most of the theory is wrong. higly recomend her videos, specially 'feminism and the disposable men' to begin. Because if you think Thunderfoot and Sargon are the other side of the spectrum (i believe them on the center) on gender you are clearly missing on other more 'radical' notions diferent groups on the manosphere have.   And that's how feminism poisons everything. In the same way Hitchens says religion poisons everything, by infecting us in our very being, by giving us a wrong idea about how and who WE are, and how we HAVE TO relate to one another. Thus the ideology reinforces the gender roles it claims to fight against everywhere it goes 'poisoning' everything.   Have at thee Sir, that's my answer.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Oh, so you're kind of a voice of reason in all of this? Cool.  *1)* Can you link me to the post or video where Thunderfoot appointed himself the atheist community's leader?...since you don't like 'absurdly overstated' theses?  *2)* So...it's cool to ridicule religious people (as long as they're not Muslims!), those were 'the good old days', but now, though you _are_ aware that there's _'a lot of really bad stuff going on in Social Justice circles lately'_ because people are _'celebrating activists ugliest impulses'_ and _'crusading against trivial and nonsensical offenses'_,  (and let's be clear...that 'crusading' often means: trying to destroy lives, trying to get people fired, to end careers, getting people arrested, doxxing people, endangering people, making false accusations, re-establishing racial segregation, openly indoctrinating children into ideologies of hatred, promoting bigotry, defending oppressive religious beliefs, silencing dissent, etc.)...we're just supposed to...um, not, talk about any of that. Oh.  *3)* Fear-Mongering = Bad.  That's why we need to stop criticizing:  - '1-in-8/6/5/4/3 women are raped on college campuses'  - 'We live in a culture that condones, excuses, even encourages rape.'  - 'White Privilege is: knowing that your White kid can play with a toy gun in the park without being shot, because: Tamir Rice.'...even though in 2015, *5* Black people were shot for carrying a toy gun, while *TWENTY TWO* _White_ people were shot for carrying a toy gun, (though, I challenge you to remember _one_ of _their_ names.)  - White people are Vampires and Black people are incapable of being racist, because racism = discrimination + power...meaning, a mentally ill homeless White man laying in a puddle of his own urine in an alley way...is _soooper_ powerful...oppressing everybody left and right...with literally, more power in his hands, than Oprah Winfrey or Barack Obama have.   Well, your video was absurd and you are part of the problem.

"With respect, you may have misunderstood Thunderf00t's discontent relating to Ms Watson's video. The problem was that instantly, Rebecca forcefully moved the focus from helping blood cancer research to the topic of herself. As she did this she spoke in a manner which would push potential donaters away from donating to the charity through her branch. He is suggesting that Rebecca's self-serving methods hampered the altruistic goal. The problem with a lot of feminists today (not feminism, as a whole) is that they are interested in only the improvement of their own individual lives, rather than trying to make the world a fairer place for women as a whole.  As a sidenote, the anger that many (not all) people have for Anita Sarkeesian, is how immoral antics has allowed her to wrongfully achieve so much. If Anita was concerned teenager, releasing her videos with the intent of helping people then less people would complain. Unfortunately, Anita is a conwoman who happily lies to fill her purse, regardless of the damage she causes to those who listen to or look up to her.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"thunderfoot is doing what good skeptics do. many of the facts presented by these new social movements you've mentioned get a lot of things wrong. many figureheads even outright lie. while i support many of the stated goals of these movements, their claims and methods leave much to be desired. hell, many, i feel, are actually doing more harm than good. this new trend of 'social justice warriors'. hypocrites that try to fight sexism by being sexist, racism by being racist.  you showed clips from a tfoot vids at 0:26 and completely missed the point he was making. the convention clip in particular showed people bitching about their identities and how that affected the value of their words. that's fucking bullshit. words speak for themselves. if you spend any amount of time taking someones words at higher value based on the color of their skin... you're racist. same for sex. its bigoted as fuck... and anti intellectual. thunderfoot's point is that this kind of 'reasoning', (lol), is antithetical to skepticism. he has a very good fucking point.  (continues watching)  wow... strawman arguments out the ass...  5:38 thunderfoot's issue is that these movements seem to want everything to be about them. atheism should be about atheism. it isn't that he doesn't care about these issues, (as you claim). it's the other problems that these kinds of people bring with them. (see second paragraph).  6:40 another one... thunderfoot wasn't claiming that men don't like looking at women's butts. (again, as you claim). he was making the point that there are biological reasons for men to be attracted to the female form. sorry, i have to go a step further: do you agree with anita that any sexy fictional character is sexist? it seemed implied. (heavily implied at 7:00) what is wrong with looking at sexy women? wtf?  7:53 i've seen evidence to the contrary... repeatedly. the individuals most often coming forward as harassed also seem to have a habitual habit of making shit up. i may be viewing a limited sample size, but it's still a visible trend. it could also be pointed out that women have much better legal representation and supportive societal motivation than men.  8:05 no true skeptic should care 'how reactionary' someone's views are. what matters is if they are right or wrong. think he's wrong? prove it.  8:09 ad hom on parade... wow... incredibly low.

A much more real and urgent issue than 'politically correct SJWs are ushering in a totalitarian nightmare' and 'white, straight cis men are asserting their hegemony by saying things I don't like' is that of political and intellectual segregation.

"Hi Nyk. Nice to see a video from you. I've been subbed for years, I believe since those 'early days' you seem to remember with such fondness. I miss your perspectives, and have usually found myself in basic agreement with you. However, now I think you've just jumped the shark. Given that you basically said you agree with the group you're criticizing on every actual point they make, your tone-policing seems disingenuous at best. At least TF, tl;dr, and Sargon strongly attempt to make counter-arguments to things actual people actually say instead of just pointing out who their opponents are hanging out with and calling them names.  To paraphrase the 'argument' you seemed to make, 'ThunderF00t's ideological company is tl;dr, Sargon, Milo, and such right-wing fanatics, so we can just ignore his actual arguments.' Never mind the fact that every one of those people except Milo considers himself a leftist, liberal, or other such left-leaning label. Now I know you'll take issue with that characterization of your 'argument', but please remind me where in the video you actually addressed the points TF and those others ever actually make? Are you going to try and claim that you made a real response to the 'butts in video games' part? The place you totally mischaracterize TF's response as 'That's just a totally scientific representation'? Woot.

"'thunderf00t, the self-proclaimed leader of atheists, says it's the fault of uppity women, black people and queers'  Got a source for that? Sounds like you're mistaken. He's been a vocal opponent of movements with top down hierarchies and set rules like atheism+. A huge demographic with just one thing in common, lack of a belief in gods, has no use for a leader who dictates infallible divine truth.   The reason the 'four horsemen' were key figures was not because of their color or gender, but because of what they had written and said about atheism, morality, evolution and science. Just like the gender, sexual orientation or ethnicity of people with regressive ideologies have nothing to do with why they are wrong. Claiming these anti-feminists are scared of women and the gays is kinda dishonest when you gloss over the content of the arguments made. Especially since you literally say 'the intellectually responsible thing is to filter the nonsense out and focus on the best arguments both sides have to offer.' A 10 second snippet of people reacting to a dumb joke is hardly an accurate representation of arguments.  There is a dangerous trend of 'listen and believe' dogmatism and totalitarian censorship in third wave feminism and new atheism that gladly censors any and all dissent and that makes oversimplified generalizations about the world to justify a victim complex which is used to profit off of. Taking issue with that hasn't got much to do with being intimidated by it. Reacting to creationists who make bad points to defend their bad dogma has become reacting to SJWs who do the same. You'd never claim atheists are scared of theists because he gave them a lot of attention and continuously pointed out their hypocrisy. Yet because gender has been so ridiculously overemphasized nowadays, everything has to be about that.  The old atheism of Hitch was all about freedom of speech, exchange of ideas, meritocracy through the substantiation of arguments, nothing being above criticism, judging what was said instead of who said it. The fact that those things are being replaced by vapid arguments made under false pretenses and censorship and no-platforming and out-of-hand dismissal based on gender/ethnicity is bad. Those values shouldn't be a trend that fades. Those are cornerstones of free societies.  Sarkeesian's argument wasn't just that men like to look at women's butts. That would defeat her whole schtick. She said that female characters' hip sway is sexist because male characters don't have it as much. Pointing out that that's like saying sexual dimorphism is sexist is not the same as saying 'asses in videogames are scientific'. Obviously. She is fabricating evidence and pretending there are no differences between men and women to make it seem like her anti-videogame tirades are legitimate. What's more, even if male and female characters had identical movesets, she would still find something to label as offensive or sexist because that's her business model.  Also, brushing off her lying about her fundraising as 'questionable'. Really?  It shows that you've been out of it for a while, but welcome back nonetheless.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Some are clearly in the Asperger range of social skills, to the point of being the poster child for that particular syndrome, while others have barely made the evolutionary leap from their mother's basement and still have the residual traits of having orange penises from years of self abuse with Cheeto stained fingers.  I suspect that the 'babes' of World of Warcraft may play no small part in this. I strongly doubt that most of these people could hold a conversation with a real woman much less maintain a relationship with one that could ever be considered healthy outside of a petting zoo.

"To be fair though -  Thunderf00t has been in the company of TJ pretty much since the beginning, if I'm not much mistaken. This is nothing new.  Also, TJ, Sargon, ArmoredSkeptic and Rubin (although Rubin seems to be going through a slightly ugly transformation as of late) are not on the right-wing by any meaningful metric, opposite of what the timing of your slide and your comment at the time seem to suggest.  That being said - I agree with the gist of your video - even as a person who does not identify as a feminist, and as a person who does not think particularly highly of academic feminist social theory.   I'm still concerned about women's rights (in particular abortion rights, FGM and working conditions in certain female dominated fields among other things), rigid gender roles, and I don't have an issue with people identifying as feminists or spending time on activism dealing specifically with women's issues.  That puts me in an unfortunate position where people might think to label me as on the right simply because my views on certain social issues might conflict with certain feminist talking points - which is silly when I am a person who's pretty hard-line progressive on most issues like gay's right to marry, or acceptance of trans-people, and pretty left when it comes to taxation and government driven education and welfare programs =S","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"0:21-0:33, weren't you a philosophy student? Don't you have better argumentation than this? Where is the principle of charity? You're just going to go straight to a straw man? Where is your video roll of evidence establishing this point?  5:31 'Social justice warriors have ruined atheism by talking about gender issues, which you say you don't care about.' You went to the effort of putting together this 10-minute video full of clips including your own original footage, but you didn't bother to find an instance of Thunderf00t saying that? You just put words in his mouth? And this is the point that you go on to argue against?  6:25 'And yet the central argument of her videos is that video games often contain lazy and sexist writing that excludes women from an important area of cultural life. This seems to me obviously true.' It isn't true. The fact that big-budget mainstream games do not cater to the tastes of women, but instead cater to the tastes of their established audience, does not exclude women from playing video games.  Supposedly, the majority of video gamers are women. URL Second, her argument isn't simply that it excludes women (which it doesn't), her argument is that it is harmful and engenders sexist attitudes in people. Which it doesn't. URL  7:44 'He objects to the worst arguments of two or three feminists on the internet, then concludes that all feminism poisons everything.' I think 'feminism poisons everything' is probably hyperbole on Thunderf00t's part (and here you are addressing that low-hanging hyperbole fruit instead of the core of his argument). Are you saying NAFALT? Not all feminists are like that, but they don't need to be for it to be a problem. Almost all of the important influential feminists are like that.  7:50 '...he doesn't seem to be aware of the body of scientific evidence, suggesting that misogyny is real.' You seem to be adopting the lazy feminist usage of misogynist. Misogyny is the hatred of women. Do you think there is a significant demographic of people that actually hate women? The fact that something doesn't cater to the preferences of women doesn't make it misogynist. If Thunderf00t doesn't acknowledge evidence of discrimination against women (which he has done) it's probably for the same reason he doesn't fixate on the evidence of discrimination against men. Men and women both face discrimination.  8:08 '...and the company they put him in.' What are you doing? Are you trying to smear Thunderf00t by associating him with a bunch of commenters? Have you established that any of these people are 'bad'?  8:11 'There's a huge surge of right wing commentary on youtube right now, and Thunderf00t's ideas fit right in with the rest of them,' I recognise at best two of the pictures you have chosen to display as examples of conservatives as actual conservatives. At least 3 of the 6 you display I know are left wing liberals. What are you doing? Do you think TheAmazingAtheist is a conservative?  9:07 'It seems more like a web of  excuses to cling to ugly and discredited behaviour.' Like what? Make a video about that. What ugly and discredited behaviour do these youtube commenters cling to? That's an interesting topic worth addressing.  9:17 'It's too bad, since I think that feminism would really benefit from engaging with some earnest and serious criticism.' This is a criticism of feminism, not the people you are addressing in this video. There is no shortage of earnest and serious criticism for feminism to choose to engage with - they choose not to and instead ignore criticism, dismiss criticism as harassment, lump criticism with abuse, or at best address straw men.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

But the loudest ones are, the ones that get public attention, the ones that talk to the UN, the ones that limit speech on campuses, the ones that get people fired for tweets about multi-sex bathrooms, etc.  And while you probably have a point that new-atheism was a fad and had to evolve somewhere, the direction it took into SJW territory is a large part in why it's dwindled down.  And yeah, obviously Thunderf00t has an interest in gender politics. Why wouldn't he? The way universities have evolved, you have to if you are interested in higher education.  So why don't you stop right there with your blanket accusations of being 'right wing' towards people who clearly aren't.

"It's been too long, Nyk.  Honestly, you've summed up in this video how I feel about the so-called issue.  I'm all for holding individuals accountable for their deplorable arguments and behavior (on both sides) - it's just that it's often been used as an excuse to paint with a broad brush.  It's those that feel as though they've been hit in the indiscriminate crossfire that have lashed out the most severely, and it's simply a tragedy that some once reasonable people have descended into what amounts to playground slap fights just for the sake of controversy.  I think you'll find that The Armored Skeptic typically, and specifically, refutes what's referred to by him as 'third wave feminism.'  As I've gathered, this recent flavor of self-titled feminism is actually a kind of Female Supremacy that prides itself on the victimization and disenfranchisement of white males for the crime of being both white and male simultaneously (obvious bigotry) - and I haven't personally seen him use it as a spring board to attack feminism generally or indiscriminately.  Be that as it may, I don't personally subscribe to -isms.  -isms in my opinion are bad.  One should not believe in an -ism, but in one's self.  I quote John Lennon; 'I don't believe in Beatles; I just believe in me.'  Wise words there ...","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Very good video! I have a few minor disagreements, but unlike Blunderf00t and co, they aren't anything I would describe as deliberate misrepresentations. I find that the examples of the occasional trivial subjects that feminists bring up are often exaggerated and clung too by anti-feminists as well, as if to suggest that Feminism is degrading humanity because of it.  To use Manspreading as but one example; I think most feminists would agree that it's more a matter of common courtesy. If you wouldn't put your bags on the seat of a busy bus or train when people need to sit, then you wouldn't be spreading your legs so wide that you are squashing the people next to you. Simple as that.  And yet when Blunderf00t and the like come along they scream from the high heavens about 'FEMINISTS CONTINUE THEIR HATE CAMPAIGN OF MEN BY COMPLAINING ABOUT NOT SQUISHING THEIR BALLS TOGETHER!'. The many examples of people bringing up 'Asking for Coffee' in reference to Emma Watson, even when it was basically an off hand comment about a social faux pas that made her uncomfortable in a general video about a different subject, also prove how Blunderf00t needs a villain to destroy in order to keep his channel going.  People complain about Anita Sarkeesian being a con artist, but at least she gives regular information breakdowns as to where the money from her crowd funding efforts go to. She may deliver on the product slowly, but at least it gets done to the promised standard. And yet as you rightly point out, many youtube Atheists see dollar signs in their eyes and jump on the bandwagon to moan about feminism when they seem to have little care or understanding for the depth of the subject.  Oh, and one more thing; the 'KillAllMen' hashtag was something that was invented by 4chan to try and frame feminism, much like the faux 'Free Bleeding' and 'End Fathers Day' hashtags. When popular Atheists have to resort to 4chan levels of reason in order to make themselves out to be heroes, it says allot more about them than it does about us.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You also put forth a fallacy that rightwing/conservative = wrongNot all the people you showed were of those things, and their arguments against things you were giving examples to were not really of the political spectrum so much.I kinda agree with the gist of what you;re trying to say (and have for a while now), but it is really coming off with a lot of bias and inconsistencies in your analysis. I also think you underestimate the scale of the problem on 'social justice' sides of the debate, though I would also in turn say the other side way way over estimates the size of the problem. Even at my college campus I come across the shit at a regular enough basis that to me it does give evidence of a problem, though as this is just me at one (large) university, it's hard to be able to say this is on a large enough scale all over to become worried about. Then there are just internet tactics used on both sides of people just yelling and screaming and getting people fired and their personal info out, though to me both 'sides' look guilty of this and it seems like a whole entirely different problem in and of it self, but the means used to justify the behavior is just related to this ridiculous bickering going on","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I definitely detect some redlettermedia influence :) I miss your videos. Make more of them.   On the substance, I value the places that some anti-feminists have in youtube culture, that is, providing reflexive pushback against social justice campaigns, most of which have at least the secondary goal of sucking some of the marrow from life. Thunderf00t is a little too obnoxious nowadays with gender pseudoscience and repetition, and I only appreciate Milo when he's an asshole to sanctimonious assholes,  but TAA says things that I can appreciate. Though it can be alleged that his protest-charity-drive was a dick measuring contest, I don't think it was. I think he's genuinely concerned about the close resemblance of modern feminism to religious moralism, and wishes to push back against that to make a space for freedom and for what he thinks are the more real struggles of women.

"A good half of this video I was wondering if you were serious or conducting some sort of bizarre social experiment to see how people would respond to it.

Along with other strange attacks and presumptions on people's character as to how they're insecure, WHITE, awkward and other, less than generous labels.   Which seems kind of hypocritical, considering you accuse these supposedly controversial high profile 'right wing' individuals of just attacking... controversial high profile 'feminist' individuals rather than engaging in debate with 'reasonable' people. Why didn't you make this video about reasonable anti-feminists?  As for what contributed to the sundering of the atheist community, It was most certainly social justice. I disengaged from several bloggers and vloggers when they switched their content from science and skepticism to a predominantly and particularly a uncompromising brand of social justice. Where disagreement was deemed immoral. You can argue people just got bored and maybe that's part of the reason, but Atheism+ had a stake too.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
