"I still disagree with the notion of 'Everyone's a little bit racist'. I think that's just a silly hyperbole. Though I do think it's true that most people, regardless of color, has had some degree of bigoted thoughts, to one degree or another, at one time or another. But even if someone having had a bigoted misconception at one point doesn't still make that person 'a little bit racist' throughout space and time for the rest of their life. I only think someone's 'a little bit racist' if they are currently a little bit racist.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I recently saw Bob the Dragqueen talking about how he has just recently realized that he is slightly and he gave the example that if he sees a woman carrying a suitcase his automatic thought is that he should help her and while that is not inherently bad itself, the idea that this woman couldn't possibly handle that big heavy suitcase and therefore he should just jump in and help her is in fact misogynistic because it does lend creed to the idea that she needs his big strong manly help.  And when he said that I realized that I have never once had to change a tire by myself.  I know how.  I know where the tools are and I know how to use them, yet if I am doing it, a man will always stop and help.  Now that I'm 40 and have back problems, this is nice, but it did used to bother me that I was seen as someone who needs help.  I have literally had a man take over after I told him repeatedly that I could do it and I didn't need his help.  Plus I used to drive a really old car that often had to be jump started so I had cables and would just find someone to be nice enough to open their hood for me, and I would go about hooking them up and MANY times a man would try to do it for me.  Now again is this the worst thing to happen?  No.  These are probably the same men who tell their daughters that they can do anything and hopefully their kindness and willingness to help would extend to a woman of color as I have always wondered if my being white had anything to do with it, but I really to believe that they would not be so ready to jump out and take over if it were another man.  But once again, thanks to everyone who helped me back when I was poor and my car wouldn't start!!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is an old video but I believe the reason that a lot of white people get offended when being told that they are privileged is because it (to them) invalidates some of the struggles that they've been through in their lives.

"I mean the way a lot of these social justice vids were framed (back before Trump was elected) could feel fairly pointed and guilt-inducing, so I understand why Skeptic was complaining about it. I think there's more than a semantic difference between saying, 'Everyone is racist' and, 'Everyone has implicit biases that can manifest themselves in acts of racism.' I think the second phrasing leaves more room for improvement -- i.e. we can be aware of these biases and try not to be accidentally racist.    But all in all this comment would have been more relevant if we were currently at a point in history where the president didn't accept support from the GrandWizard of the KKK and talk about grabbing women by the pussy. Now we have the same anti-sjw types complaining about snowflakes who can't handle micro-aggressions, when actually we're complaining about how there are actual Nazi rallies happening in the streets.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I agree that racial bias exists and hurts people, and that many if not all people have it. I'm trying to broaden my horizons without sticking to one side steadfastly.

"Two years later with people coming out of the woodworks being racist, homophobic, transphobic, and every other phobic under the sun, it surely does seem like he had a very sheltered experience as part of the system. Got to love the old, 'if I don't experience it, it can't be real' mentality. It's kind of depressing. Especially when we live in a day and age where other people's experiences are a Google search, a video, or even a question away. If only there were a way to talk to a marginalized group of people and ask them what it's like. It's such a shame we will never have that opportunity. No one wants you to feel guilty for being white or man. We want you to feel empathy and understand what it's like to walk in a another person's shoes. If he can't do that, how much of a skeptic is he? Are you really skeptical if you don't fully understand what you're talking about or is it that you're just not fully understanding what you're talking about?

"I agree with a lot of what you have to say, but I still contend that 'Every person (of a certain race, ethnicity, sex, gender, etc.) is a (insert negative characteristic here).' is a fundamentally bigoted statement that isn't very likely to win over minds among the diverse and politically varied class of people you are accusing of all possessing said negative characteristic. It's absolutely fair to argue that people who think a certain way or have a certain opinion share a negative characteristic associated with that manner of thinking or opinion, but to say that an entire class of people, by definition, must share some opinion, belief, or way of thinking, is wrong (both factually and morally). Not only is it wrong (on an interpersonal level, because it's blatantly insulting) to say 'all whites are racist' or 'all men are sexist', but even if making these (ironic) bigoted over-generalized accusations of bigotry leveled against an entire class of people don't harm those people the way other forms of bigotry do, you are still needlessly making political enemies out of people who may have been your allies (or would have at least been willing to have a civil discussion with you) had you simply chosen to state your case in a less accusatory and more respectful manner. When I hear 'All (people like you) are (bad in some way), my first instinct isn't to ask why you feel that way, my first instinct is to say 'No, we're not, and I know that because I'm not, you bigot.' and that's not really very productive if your objective is to have a productive conversation about the complex social and political issues surrounding race, ethnicity, sex, gender, etc. (though it is very productive if you are looking to start a conflict).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Privilege is a construct designed to socially and intellectually stagger individuals who refuse to fall into a dynamic of the all-consuming intersectionality used to push a progressive agenda. It's a means of social manipulation that posits fake insecurities to control others. It's gaslighting for hypocritical moralists. Racism is an unfortunate product of human experience being determined entirely on perspective which requires referential data to function. Everything is built upon reference to all other things, and our brains form connections from this to allow us to understand the world around us. Thus, you could argue we operate on fundamental assumptions and generalizations simply to function. Allowing that perspective to be a product of your focus on how you feel like a victim and what you decide qualifies as injustice will inevitably create a world where all you see is how other people do things that make you feel more like a victim if you fail to contextualize it in a larger sense of human action and independence. You can't choose what you're shaped by, but you can choose how you use the information you absorb. Pretending as if racism is a fundamental flaw in others to be exploited for your own gain because you feel justified is willful ignorance at best and selfish bigotry at worst. You pretended Fascists are breathing down the world's neck because it suits your perspective of a tyrannical challenge to your individuality, and only your brave protagonist underdogs can win the day.

"Although I'm years late to this, I'm someone who watched Armored Skeptic and his anti-SJW ilk (and sometimes still do) for years, and one of the big reasons it was so easy to agree with them is because they were defending myself and those like me against seemingly influential people who wanted me to feel guilty for being white and Male and to confess that I'm racist, sexist, homophobic, and transphobic.  The thing is, I don't want to feel guilty for what I am. No one does, and the fact that some are calling for me to do so is off-putting. Contra addresses this in the video.   The other side is admitting biases (a la 'everyone's a little bit racist'). Admitting one is racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, etc. will ruin one's life and career, and so often the left does not forgive and does not forget. So either one is inclined to resist the notion that they could have unconscious biases, and therefore possibly unwittingly contribute to unfair biases in society, or they must confess something that makes them feel bad about themselves (see point one) and that others would consider them an evil person for admitting.   It's a catch-22. The left wants people to admit their biases and prejudices so they are aware of them, but they also won't let someone with biases and prejudices ever live it down. There needs to be a new philosophy toward forgiveness and reformation on the left, or it will continue to make people defensive and drive them away, right into the manipulative hands of the right.  As for me, I'd never admit this stuff in public for fear of ruining my life, but your points have at least let me realize my biases and problems and admitted them to myself in private, and for that, thank you, Contra.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

This video brought up one of them, and I was mostly wondering if anyone else thinks like I do, or if I'm really the only one? Etymology buffs welcome.  Butthurt! I've long since realized that most people seem to mean something related to anal penetration of some kind when they use this term, in order to refer to someone being a crybaby about something (in the actual, figurative sense). To me however, this always evoked thoughts about a petulent child getting a little slap on the good old rear, and their indignation and exaggerated tears afterwards. Why would you default to anal sex with this?? Or is it just me being naive here?  Pussy! As in, to call someone a coward. Most people would say the word in this usage is related to female genitalia.

"This is Armoured Skeptic's big, gaping blind spot. He sees racism and bigotry as a matter of history: something that used to exist but is now largely corrected and anyone claiming to experience these things today is just an overly sensitive drama queen looking to capitalize on people's guilt. Thing is, I still like Skeptic. I like hearing his opinions on things because I think he still has a brain in his head. And when he DOES respond to racist assholes he's pretty good. He may use 'SJW' as a pejorative unironically, but he still supports racial, gender, and sexual equality. I don't see him being as bad as.... saaaay.... his friend, Sargon.  But I think you hit on an interesting point. Skeptic is not as critical of people like Sargon and Dave Rubin and they both just happen to support him financially as well a portion of their audience. While this doesn't mean The Skeptic is necessarily obligated agree with them, it does give him a financial incentive to not scrutinize them too closely and to proclaim the evils of the 'toxic SJW leftist identity politics' as often as possible. He critiqued Sargon's awful debate at Skepticon, sure, but they were really more just quick jabs rather than a deeper look at Sargon's troubling politics. Nothing more than Sargon would admit to himself (the guy IS bankrolling him, after all, gotta keep things light).  What I'm saying is, I'm happy there are people like you, Contra, who are finally giving some pushback against this ugly, conservative attitude that has taken root in otherwise progressive communities.

"'Yes, this milo. Who sometimes wears a dress, and sometimes spins around in a chair-' This is not really a good counter-point to the possibility that she can be a bully. You know this. Someone who bullies someone else can deliberately be given the appearance of someone who is innocent, this is because the bully has a vested interest in avoiding any backlash from the bullying itself.  The 'aww she's so cute and innocent!' part of her character could be abused to keep on bullying someone. I'll give you an example; Bill Cosby.  Many arguments against Bill Cosby include that he was using his position as a children's TV show star as being innocent, they 'couldn't believe that such a kind hearted person could do something like this', as well as abusing his power. And Milo does have power. If you are defending her, and people care about your opinion for example, this means that attacking Milo could invoke your wrath. That creates a social pressure not to call Milo out on any flaws or bullying she may or may not commit.  This is also a core of the whole idea that women can be abusers, when someone references the fact women can be abusive, they will also point out that she can tend to manipulate people into thinking that she is innocent because of a superficial surface presentation as a good person. This is why a skeptical approach to feminism is REQUIRED.  You MUST question feminism? You MUST question women, because if you do NOT question women, then she will be able to ABUSE A POSITION OF ABSOLUTE TRUST. Because if she says that she is a feminist, this immediately absolves her of ever being in the wrong, or evil. It means that she is invincible. This is absolute power socially. That is what many 'skeptics' can be rightfully afraid of, you must always be wary of someone who looks like you, or supports you, because they're capable of that form of abuse.  Though do you always need to do this? No. That would make life unlivable. If you always questioned women, you wouldn't be able to enjoy a moment of intimacy with a woman to its fullest. You wouldn't be able to say in a meaningful, romantic way, 'I trust you, I love you.' At some point taking a risk is required in order to experience that part of life. And I think that's worth it.  Okay; now that reasoning is up, I'm going to call out the other side now.  You guys can make these mistakes. You aren't beyond question. That's the whole point of skepticism. You could be wrong tomorrow when you call all feminists 'cucked losers', this is possible. And I think you're full of shit / reprehensible as human beings when you are totally dismissive of that counter point. Because you are the one you hate.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"'You seem to want to deny any involvement within a community because it goes against the idea that you're an individual.' Okay, this is being generous. I think that they don't want to seriously associate with them because when they know that they're all going to fuck up, they have deniability. It's a power move. If you just happen to use someone's opinions which in one instant might be right, you get the benefit of having their good moments.  But by dissociating with them officially, you're not condoning either; Shit that you know they're getting wrong because they (might be an idiot), or the idea that deep down, you actually believe they're going to fuck this up one day because something about their rhetoric seems 'weak', and will not stand the test of time.  And the reason I would pick the more favorable position 'I do it because I'm an individual, not part of that community!' Is so that I can avoid making my own arguments look bad by the association with a lot of bad shit. Also of note; Thunderfoot has officially been distancing himself from these edgelords. Whether or not he is anti-feminist might be indicative of him having doubts, etc. But the turning point for him appeared to be Brexit, and Trump.  Post-brexit and Trump, a lot of people who were from this more sane demographic realized, oh, shit, maybe they're actually a bunch of idiots, and now I should cash in on my distance before they tank fully. And you know what? I don't blame them. So be lenient, some of them actually are pretty good, you know? Armoured Skeptic is not his audience that is saying 'anal rape' in those comments.  I'd even go so far as to say, he probably fucking despises these people.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"'Why is anal rape important to establish a point of view anyway?' Because doing something to someone else is seen as right, because might makes right. Even though the act of anal rape isn't right, it still carries to presupposition that you can't do anything about it. So you should just bend over and accept fate.  Which is, like, the exact opposite of what they themselves believe to be true, and is seen as something that they should avoid at all costs. Essentially holding others to standards that they do not hold themselves to. The triumph of rationality becomes something else through this lens.  They're arguing for only triumph, not rationality. This becomes a problem for them when the idea that they are rational has everything to do with how they are triumphant. They basically lost in that sense. Also is this what Armoured Skeptic believes? I didn't watch all the video yet, but I'm pretty doubtful.  I do agree that this stuff is kind of hardcore cringey shit that an audience can come up with that makes me want to dip them in running lava whilst I hear their agonized screams juxtaposed through glasses which have their comments about what is rational just transparent enough that I can see their melting faces in that image.  Because, you know? I mean. I'm not wrong for posting that my opponent should be dipped in lava, or that they are, right? Just like you're not actually saying they're getting raped.  All of this comes down to dominance in the physical sense. The audience, I'm not even going to say 'just men' because this is false, equate the idea of being able to do what you want as dominant. That's called power. Real, tangible power. Rejection of this power is reasonable from any organisms point of view. Because you are protecting yourself from someone who can get away with anal rape (even though they can't). This is also at the very core of fascism.  'As long as I win, it doesn't matter if I'm retarded, because no-one can stop me.' This is the super evil bad guys ultimatum. And the solution to that is a gun.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

That's where a lot of defensiveness comes from (and on the other hand, racial self-flagellation). That in no way invalidates the fact that White privilege still exists. In fact, it's a problem because White privilege exists. But yeah, I think it needs to be addressed in a constructive manner, because right now, it's just a festering wound. I actually think it has something to do with why Trump got elected in the first place. Having experienced those kinds of feelings myself... What would have helped me a lot at that time would've been for someone to tell me that it wasn't wrong simply to feel that way, that they could see what I would, and that those feelings mattered. If I'd felt validated in that way, it would've been a lot easier to get past my own defensiveness and think about what other people were experiencing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It's almost a mortal insult to someone with that kind of mindset.

Ben Shapiro defines it as racism in the legal system and says it doesn't exist, though sure there are a lot of racists (look at the alt-right).

Yes everyone has had a racist thought at some point, but you're moving the goal post because having had a racist thought or being biased somewhat is not the same as being a racist. Even kids might be confused and believe a stereotype for a little while, these are not racists in my view. These are people who are mistaken about something, or ignorant about people who are different in some respect, but they ultimately do not believe the next point. A racist in my view believes race differences matter. That people of different races are fundamentally different from their race somehow.

"I'd say this video has not aged very well, considering how the problems with IAT's have come to light very publicly and with incredibly robust evidence in the last couple years, but then again, the evidence was mounting pretty much since the test's inception, and it looks as if it was the notion behind the test that propelled its popularity rather than being recommended by the literature.  So in any case, the evidence presented here is unfortunately tainted with a great degree of selective bias.  Not that one can really be blamed for getting the impression that this was otherwise, given the massive hype and reverence the test and its associated programs were given.

That guy was my shy boyfriend!  They  act like people are actively segregated and we don't give more scholarships to blavk people for diversity quotas and let them into uni with lower test scores. Abd ssians with higher else they would be far majority asian. There are diversity quotas that need to be reached. In the US.   Yeah my country works in levels. It is true that in high schools there are more non white/asian proportionally the lower you go. They supposedly get lower advice.  But this can easily be because the entire friend group of my parents makes them do a level above theirs simply with having the only thing those kids do.

"1. I have always hated the idea that if something is a fact, it should be very easy to prove. That is not how the scientific method works. you can prove a negative, you cannot prove a positive.   2. I think the problem comes from the use of the word 'racist'. Sometimes it is used in a way that is almost interchangeable with pure evil, (Nazis are racists, Klansmen are racist, Dylan Roof is a racist) Yet other times it is used to refer to an internal set of prejudices that everyone has. And still other times it is used to refer to an internal set of prejudices white people have because they are empowered. The speaker then cherry picks the definition they need at any given time.  However, the listener is sometimes unsure which 'racist' the speaker was referring to.   If a Japanesse man shouts the N word and shoots 3 black men because he didn't like their music, is that racist?  Well, if you go by the power + prejudice definition. No. That isn't racism that is prejudice.   And I think that is where the conversation often breaks down. People on the far right, mostly, believe that racism is bad. We are actually both in agreement. In their head, they have the 'racism is pure evil' definition. So to tell them, 'you are racist and I am not because I am a minority.' Is a pretty big insult. They don't see you threading some linguistic needle, they see you insulting them while absolving yourself of any wrong doing. If you really want to convince someone on the right, the best option is to not even use the word racist.   'yeah man, prejudice is bad. Racial prejudice. LGBT prejudice. prejudice against a person for their gender. It's all bad.'  3. Also black lives matter has done more harm than good for black rights. While I completely agree with their mission statement, so many individual bad actor have used to organisation as a shield for their own bad decisions that the whole image has been sullied. I really think this got to its worst in the 'all lives matter' push back. The correct reply to someone who says 'all lives matter' IS TO FUCKING AGREE WITH THEM. If you see someone holding up a sign that says 'all lives matter', just look at them, say 'dude your right.' what are you going to do to help protect black people. Because all live matter.   Pushing back against 'all lives matter' was really the death knell for the organisation to the right...... that and the murders.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Armored Skeptic is a racist because he's a racist.  He's a white guy who says racist things and uses his channel to hate-monger.  If his narrow ass wants someone to say it to his face, I'd be more than happy to.    He's also a rape apologist, just like the Sarah Palin like nut-bag he's dating.  (I know exactly who shoe-head is.)  Hey, check that out, he's a racist asshole dating a racist asshole who claims she's a liberal.  Poor thing.   (Then again, she can be a liberal because white liberals almost make the KKK look like an SJW love group with how they do racism.)  They are both monsters and should be treated like monsters.  As for this notion of 'white-guilt' - that is bullshit.   White people have been claiming this guilt thing for over 40 years now, yet they sustain systematic racism, and make excuses for it but continue it.  Here's the thing.  Something like racism needs a society to agree to it in order for it to be sustained for the more than 600 years it's existed.   If racism was only a 'few' or if it was just the fringe it would not exist on the level it exists today.  It takes a society to keep that going and black people are not the ones keeping it going.   What white people have to prove is that they are not racist.  First, they have to stop voting for racist presidents.  In the entire history of this country, there has only been one president who wasn't a racist, and soon as he left white people doubled down and voted in an orange racist.  But everyone is supposed to feel good about whites and their racism because some of them voted for Obama?    Oh yeah, that's a reason to forget the YouTube super racist skeptic community who promotes black murder, who promotes rape apology.   The one thing I wish these idiots would do is just admit they seriously want to date Anita Sarkesian but she's to smart to date assholes and that's really why they are mad at her.  That be a step in the right direction of something resembling mental health for these psychotic fucks.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I always kind of chuckle at the 'white guilt' argument. If you are not feeling any guilt why are you on about it all the time, like always incessantly. I don't think about white guilt at all because I don't have any. I don't nor have ever felt responsible for people before me that were white and did bad things, but at the same time I recognise those things did and still are happening. I am not on 'team white' so I feel no need to defend myself or my 'racial honor'. As a result guys like AS are repellant to me, if he seriously does not know what has been going on and still persists towards black people he is either willfully ignorant or an idiot. Either condition lends itself to not making a channel preaching ethics. Good on you Contra for making these, You keep doing what you do and if the time comes that kitty needs somone to swing a bat along with her...I'll be there, it's the only thing I am really good at.

"Well, i'm not an expert, but I have known many Nazis and their way of solving things, as well as establishing dominance, is through sexual intimidation. That might be why there are so many 'butthurt' and 'fagoty ass panties' remarks in response to his argument against you. Most neo-nazis and alt-right supporters are the poor republican types who wrestle in their yard shirtless with one another. Either that or they are 'good ol boys' who don't feel comfortable around people of difference.   Every Neo-Nazi I have ever met was raped by one of his 'friends' at one point. It's almost like a silence/sealing to form them into the pack. It's pretty twisted but it's like the defining moment for most of them. The scene in 'American History X' where the older brother is raped in prison would have been more realistic if he took the seat the Brotherhood had offered him the next day. It's an abusive relationship with a whole organization and ideology for most. Some people stay because they're afraid of the ridicule they will face, as well as having to address the issue at all. It's a Stockholm syndrome that usually begins in adolescence and spirals into adulthood, distancing them from any tenderness as it is not seen as 'true feeling'.   Basically it's like the kid who bullies other kids because they're afraid of being bullied themselves. Violence (especially sexual violence) is seen as an inevitability, from which they are not safe (even among friends and family) so they misdirect their anguish and resentment towards an easier target. The reason so many people are racist is simply because it is the easiest way to cope with the hardships they have been put through.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"A large part of the problem is that the word 'racism' (while still having a meaning) has become a go to excuse that non white people use any time they get called on their bullshit. This means that the word has been watered down. There's an ever growing number of white people like me who refuse to let ourselves be manipulated any more. Unfortunately this has also caused many of those same people -myself included- to reflexively doubt allegations of racism.   It's also worth noting that racism is only really taboo when it comes from white people. Other races are racist against other ethnicities and their own all the time. While most of this racism is harmless there are instances of non white racism directly effecting white people in negative ways. The long and short of it is that this issue is far more complex then either the alt right or the alt left are willing to admit.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I agree with most of your video, but the problem I have here is that you take the final step and call inherent racial bias 'racism.' I think that that word is the lynchpin of the entire problem and disagreement here: the word 'racist' has *such* an extreme negative connotation, that using it when you talk about something 'everyone has' (innate racial bias) makes you come off very badly. It makes it sound like you are attacking the character and personal value of every single white person when you say that 'all white people are a little bit racist'... because, by using the word 'racism,' you ARE attacking the character and value of every single person.  It is undeniable that there is large-scale racial injustice at work in the United States on an institutional level. I would even venture so far as to say that it's undeniable that there is explicit racism at play on multiple levels in this institutionalized system. However, when you spread that blame to every white person--by claiming that 'all white people are racist'--you are implying that the least guilty among them is as bad as the most guilty. No matter what adjective (slightly/minutely/a little bit) you put in front of racist, you are still using the word 'racist' to apparently describe every white person that exists, meaning you are applying the full weight of its negative connotation--and the consequences thereof upon the accused person's perceived character--to all of those people. And that is, frankly, an insult.  To me, and to most people (I think), the word 'racism' implies explicit intent. So you have accused every white person of explicitly, intentionally being racist. You can't say 'inherent bias' or attribute it to culture/psychology/neurology, and then follow it up by calling them racists in ANY way, because no matter what excuse or clarification came before, you used the RACIST WORD. That negates every qualifier, and turns it into an ad-hominem attack of a person's very moral stature. So, yeah, in a way it IS an entirely invalid claim--is indeed a racist claim--simply because you used the word 'racist.' If you just leave it at 'inherent internal bias' or some variant thereof, I think we can all agree that it's pretty much true. But you took it too far.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As far as I can tell Skeptic did not say Racism was over. He did say that something like Black Lives Matter is a regressive movement because the effect it has is that the division between ethnic groups that seems to be enhanced by seemingly trying to create more separation. This viewpoint, I think, is not that awkward. There is indeed something to be said for this point of view. This does however not mean that there isn't any legitimacy behind the complaints and issues brought up by BLM. To the best of my recollection (and I'm quite sure I've seen all Skeptics videos) he has never claimed that racism doesn't exist nor that that minorities are always treated fairly. I do understand where you would take issue with his statement that 'they are not oppressed'. We could indeed reasonably argue that Black people (and other ethnic groups) are oppressed. The problem I see is how directly we look at how people are being oppressed. Under the law people have equal rights, and are free... from this viewpoint people are not oppressed. Indeed this does not account for how society treats people, through explicit and implicit  bias. It also doesn't account for laws that technically apply to everyone, but disproportionately affect a minority group.  Anyway, loving your videos ^^","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"People who don't see race don't not see it for a reason. It literally has never occurred to then why race has any meaning to them. Speaking as someone who understands this. I was raised in a place with many different looking people, it wasn't long ago I could not tell you someone's race just by looking at them. That's all that we mean, at least for the most part.   It's also bizarre in modern day to suddenly hear people start separating and grouping people by race. Even scary. You have to be grouping extremely disparate people together solely off a glance at them. So I know I can speak for many people that if you were to try to put me in a group by race, you would basically be randomly putting me in a group based on nothing but similar looks I guess? So to me, the last thing I want is a world focused on race or worse, people acting like race is anything more than a social construct.   A big reason why I've never understood being able to see race, what exactly is there to see? What meaning do you gain by knowing someone's socially constructed race? In my experience, few people identify themaelvez by their race. That is, if asked about who they are or something important about them, I can't imagine their race popping up.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"SJWs are literally the only thing I hear people call them. I have no other context, but in never wrong when using the term.an sjw is always someone with verifiable wrong beliefs. Often they believe in their ideology like it is religion, rather than a collection of belief based on facts.  That is what sjw means, so by definition it's good to be anti-idiot and to not respect beliefs without evidence. They literally say the same things, in the same exact way. Suggesting they have no free will to believe it, they simple are stating beliefs chosen for them, beliefs which no amount of evidence will change. (like being dedicated to believing 2+2=5). Exactly like propaganda or brainwash victims, losing ability to think critically about beliefs they hold. Likely because of the echo chamber effect. Never having heard from people who believe things not in agreement with what they believe, they have no context to even understand how they could possibly be wrong. Exactly the same as a religious person dedicated to their belief in things which are literally made up ideas that reality doesn't support.  Because anti-sjw sentement is the majority of people, we have luxery of using the term because it's not offensive to anyone we know and is understood easily to people who haven't heard the term before. This is why there is no attempt by any party to silence them. Most people, when presented with them, laugh at how absurd their beliefs are, additionally we need bad ideas so we can contrast then with great and brilliant ideas. SJWs are perfect examples of people holding terrible ideas in which there is simply no way to fix.   The term 'social justice warrior' is funny, and meant to show how mislead people can be. Believing they are fighting injustice which either literally does not exist, actively creates more injustice,  actively harms all parties, otherwise does nothing just.. None of these scenarios result in any justice for anyone, but most result in injustice. Because of how backward it is, no better term than a social justice warrior. Too stupid to know what social justice actually is. I think it stems from thinking you can somehow bring justice on long dead people for crimes against other long dead people, by trying to punish people who simply look similar to the long dead guilty people. That's not what social justice is. Nor would it be possible to bring dead people to justice.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Ghat damn, this comments section. It's like falling into an alt-right channel all over again (not comparing this to an alt-right channel, just cringing at the 'dialogue' in some of the top comments.)  tbh that's one of the worse videos Armoured Skeptic did. Both of them I came out feeling gross and conflicted because he was pretty clearly cherry-picking. Liked them anyways because they *did* make me think, but they weren't great.  Now, this video left me feeling gross in a similar way. Much like AS cherry-picked to support his argument about there being disturbing anti-white racism around, there seems to be a denial here that there's a HUGE swath of the community labeled by their opponents as 'SJW' that's out for blood, either real or via guilt. Through everyday life I've met quite a large number of people I would feel justified in calling an SJW, and EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. of them _explicitly_ stated they wanted white people to *show them* they felt guilty. I feel comfortable in saying that while my sample is clearly populated by outsiders, the sheer number, consistency and prevalence of these outliers, combined with their goal, is disturbing. I will continue to support people who won't shy away from recognizing and denouncing these people until I am comfortable it's been reduced to the same numbers as genuine white supremacists in my community have been (to about 1% or less.) This includes Contra and the less idiotic portions of the Skeptic community (IMO AS, HBR, Appabend, PSA, occasionally Chris Ray Gun and Technical Dave.)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Although I agree with a lot of what you said in this video, I think it's difficult to try to quantify the notion of implicit bias.  To begin with, the data you cited at (8:10) in your video is somewhat faulty - the test-retest reliability of the meta-analysis you included is extraordinarily low, especially when compared to the standard other psychological instruments are held to. Your chosen report pins this number at around r=.274, whereas most researchers hold their tests to a standard of r=.8. This essentially means your results from taking the IAT will differ a great deal depending on the test session.  Secondly, there's a significant collection of other scholarly work that is at odds with the analysis you presented. For example, a 2016 report published in the Scandinavian Journal of Psychology concluded from another meta-analysis that the correlation between implicit bias and its real-world manifestations was around 2% - in other words, insignificant. Another meta-analysis analyzing almost 500 (!) studies published in OSF also pinned the rate as being quite low.  As I said before, I think you presented a lot of fair points in the video - I just don't believe pushing the concept of implicit bias is a winning argument.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I have to admit I have a top comment on these Skeptics videos. It is fascinating actually reading this comment now a year later.  In a way I have to thank Trumps victory for this, since it woke me out of my slumber and made me realize that half the people I was subscribed to since Gamer Gate actually were only a few steps short of becoming neo nazis (Godwins Law has been invoked).  I have always been on the left. Not really on social themes mostly but economically. So I really thought I was surrounded by people who also were on the left who would just pick on the few crazy outliners that made us normies look bad.  The reason I just hated on milo in a comment on AS channel was that I simply never watched the original. Listen and believe is a main reason why Anti-sjw channel even can exist. I mean armored skeptic even never cites sources to make sure no one ever looks this stuff up but that's besides the point now.   The best analysis of this behaviour I have seen so far is by hbomberguy in his Thunderf00t Ghostbuster video.

There has been a palpable rise in racial tension for a few years now as more and more cops kill unarmed black men, and the potentially justifiable outrage of the black community causes a potentially justifiable backlash among white people.  The AntiSJW content is cherry picked radical nonsense that bastardizes a lot of inherently valid arguments; However to deny that such sentiment exists would be intellectually dishonest, the Anti's have a point when they show brutal assaults with bike locks or kidnappings, just as the left has with actual unjust shootings of unarmed black men etc.  TL;DR: Everyone needs to stop bandwagoning complex ethical and moral ideologies and come to conclusions themselves.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Of course people have inherent biases but they are by no means confined to skin colour - attractiveness, height, hair colour, voice, social group, nationality, basically any individual trait, so just saying 'therefore Milo was kind of right that all white people are racist and transphobic' is either shortsighted or thoroughly disingenuous (particularly given that he clearly wasn't making the kind of nuanced point you're obviously trying to make here). Also a lot of the criticism of this argument, which is completely justified in my opinion, revolves around the fact that (a) going around calling everyone a racist is counterproductive to say the least, and (b) no-one seems to be suggesting any solutions.

BLM has gotten a bit out of control to the point where they highjacked a gay pride parade last year to issue demands to the citizens of Toronto, not legislators. BLM may have a good goal, but there are contradictory actions in the execution across various chapters. There's a reason a lot of people are skeptical about the movement.

"7:50 Can we please talk about 'Sure, bias sucks, but bias isn't inherently a problem'  If it isn't inherently a problem then why does he concede that it inherently sucks? Also, the notion that people acting on their biases isn't so prevalent among mankind that one can safely generalize that people do so is...almost charmingly naive.  I have realized that many of the 'good one' skeptics in the YouTube skeptic community who fall on the 'antifeminist' or 'anti-SJW' part of the spectrum, people like Armoured Skeptic, suffer from the Dunning-Kruger effect - just not the part about it that everyone uses when they bring it up. The flip side of the Dunning-Kruger effect is that people who are very smart and well-reasoned tend to underestimate themselves in some ways intellectually - and critically, they *over*estimate other people. When Skeptic suggests the notion that people don't automatically act on their biases, he is acting on his own bias of seeing the world through the lens of his own consciousness, and unconsciously giving credit to people who absolutely do not deserve it because he finds it easy not to act on his biases (mostly), so he doesn't understand how utterly many other people are a slave to them, since he's never really experienced that state of mind.  It's like trying to talk LSD trips with someone when you've never dropped acid. You can understand what they're saying, but you can only conceptualize it in frames of reference you've experienced (none of which include dropping a Literal. Gallon. of LSD so your conceptualization of it is inevitably going to be wrong).  Also, perpetual LSD trips are a good explanation for the mind of much of the anti-SJW community.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I don't think there's one anti-SJW community on youtube, there are two, with quite a bit of a spectrum between them.  At the one end you get the sceptic (often atheist) community, which more than anything dislikes the spirituality of social justice, in the sense that for example 'check your privileges!' has an uncanny resemblance to 'repent your sins!'.  At the other end you get the white nationalists, social conservatists, MGTOW etc. who are typically very much in favour of a strong moral code, just not the same one as SJWs. The reason AS rejects the idea of an anti-SJW community is that the tribalism that comes with such a tag brings a community standard, a moral code of sorts; at the sceptic end of the anti-SJWs they would reject that, quite in contrast to the right wing of that spectrum.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

No, men are much more likely to commit a crime. Ok. So you have not uncovered racism. (Engage mental gymnastics... Men in power do it to men because patriarchy.) Here is an anti-SJW point about racism. Many an SJW (despite their claims) do not oppose racism. They oppose only this racism or that racism. So for example. The Samoan who gets the shit kicked out of him for walking into a Tongan Bar and being a Samoan (and vice versa). Or the Fijian who hates Indians. This does not compute as a serious problem to many an SJW. It is my contention that it is just as serious a problem as any other example of racism. Unless you treat all racists equally you are not fighting racism. As for all those fellow YT who have not experienced racism! I say. Get out and about a little more and pay attention.

"My position is everyone can be racist. Minority are racist and prejudicial to the minorities.

"I think there's a misunderstanding going on here.  People like Skeptic are not arguing that racism doesn't exist anymore; they're arguing about the SCALE. The reason they reject the concept of 'systemic oppression' is that any law that penalized people for not being white has been long since abolished. The idea that America up until the mid-20th century, where 'colored' people couldn't even use the same drinking fountains as white people, and modern-day America are just as bad should be obviously be ridiculed.  In regards to the police, it's generally accepted that there are some racist cops out there, and some arrests and shootings are completely unjustified. However, even if you could make sure that the police were completely unbiased, you would still likely see black people arrested and shot at a disproportionate rate, because the uncomfortable truth remains that black people do have very high rates of crime and resisting arrest. One of the problems with BLM is that they themselves are racially biased; they will look at a case like Michael Brown, who was caught on tape committing strong-armed robbery, who every credible eyewitness agrees to be the aggressor during his altercation with the cop, and who forensics indicates was NOT shot in the back, and to this day are still portraying him as an innocent oppressed victim and the cop as evil, because Brown is black and Officer Wilson is white.  One quick point on the sentencing disparity. I have observed several feminists brush off the sentencing difference between men and women as benevolent sexism, yet the difference between blacks and whites, six times smaller, is an example of white privilege. It's either privilege for BOTH women and whites or it's benevolent bigotry for both.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'Almost no one is explicitly racist anymore.' Is it okay to criticize those who still are then? I believe the main functional distinction between bias and racism is that of intent. Understanding a person's intent is valuable knowledge to me and muddying the waters with amoral bias is very unproductive. Even if you would not personally abuse it, others will and have, and so racism as a label loses it's stigma.   Words are simply tools for conveying ideas, what benefit is there to conflating racism with unconscious bias?

Over the years I've seen a lot of people cry about how someone is trying to make them feel guilty for being male or white or whatever in response to a video or article that is very plainly attempting to do no such thing.  It sort of makes me suspect that there's already some guilt there, and they don't know how to cope with it except to deny that there's anything to feel guilty about by denying that privilege exists.  Also, totally anecdotal here, but a lot of the people crying about how SJWs are trying to make them feel guilty have some sort of Randian ideas about morality and that to receive an advantage (or anything for that matter) that was in some sense unearned, whether it was asked for or not, is a moral sin.  That kind of outlook makes it difficult to reconcile the state of the world with the desire to consider yourself a good person, and it's acknowledging the state of the world that gets sacrificed.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"rac*ism 'ra,siz@m/Submit noun the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.  Having a bias to a certain race of people is LITERALLY one of the definitions of racism. It doesn't matter how small or irrelevant the bias is, it's still a characteristic racism. The point skeptic made points out the hypocritical nature of this movement of social justice. While they champion the fact they are so anti-racist, they make blanket claims like, 'All white people are racist' or 'White people are responsible for the current issues in the black community.'  Saying all white people are racist, is racist no matter how you spin it. Also saying that white are responsible for slavery is down-right ignorant. All races practiced slavery at one point in time. The Atlantic Slave Trade was fueled by other blacks selling other Blacks to Europeans.  Hears a link to prove so  URL Saying white people are all responsible for actions of ancestors is just like saying all Muslims are responsible for Isis. Yet you people call anyone who even dares to criticize any Muslim a bigot or a Islamiphobe. Plus when I just typed Islamiphobe in, red bar appeared under it. But I digress. Skeptic called out the hypocrisy in movement. Saying, 'Every one is bit racist sometimes' is not a comeback.

Take for instance the video about the man killed while searching for his wallet, yeah he didn't have a weapon yeah it sucks he was shot but he didn't comply with the police and that is the MAIN factor in all of these shootings not race as many people would suggest. He was shot because he ran from the police essentially took cover and began digging in his pockets if you don't see why someone may think he was going for a weapon in that situation you might need to look a little harder. Even in this video while it seems you're not a shill or absolutely blind you still parrot the same emotional appeals that are meant to drag on people's senses of morality and empathy, instead of the arguments being about what's correct and incorrect.

Having said that, if you belong to a group who want's people to stop being racist towards them, and then you turn around and are racist towards that same group of people, you end up looking like a hypocrite.

If you as an individual want other people to stop doing something, don't turn around and do the same to them and expect a positive result.

We all have privileges,even every minority group in todays time. So why do these guys have to be the butt of every joke. Its ok to blame the 'man' but not all whites are the man. Its all a matter of class warfare, and eveyone assumes whites are richer. There are plenty of poor whites, and whites who have student loans too. Ask an observant Christian these days if he has been bullied because of his religion. Im not going to go tit for tat, but stop dumping on your real allies.

"Anecdote 1: Crash Course.  In this particular case I disagree that it was an injustice. All that person needed to do was show his hands and that entire situation would have went very differently. As a general though, yes, it is unjust how much less leeway blacks get than whites in similar situations, but, and yes there is always a but, I don't see any sort of practical way to avoid it. Blaming Police is at best disingenuous, and frankly telling them 'no, treat them the same no matter what the crime stats and personal experience states' isn't going to happen. Many police officers have little trouble putting their lives on the line to protect innocents, but it is absurd to expect them to protect what is a possible threat. Self preservation wins that. Not racial bias. Unless you actually want to argue that statistics are racist? The only reasonable 'answer' to this issue I have heard is body cameras to prosecute after the fact, and to remove 'problem' officers where able.    Anecdote 2: Real Racists  This entire thing is disingenuous. BLM has repeatedly claimed things are 'racial discrimination' that aren't. A big one being hair. If that constitutes racial discrimination then clearly Safeway's grooming policy of no beards is blatantly sexist. Further, there is anecdotes aplenty where equal treatment isn't given to blatantly racist transgressions. For example last year during the Southern Pride flag fiasco 4 black men chased, and ran down another black man who was counter protesting in favor of it. Of the 5 articles I read on the matter all tried to bury the race of the attackers, and tried pushing the victims 'mental instability'. I mean clearly black lives mattered then?   White racism is a lot more harmful.   Wait wait wait. So it is ok for them to do it because they are a minority group that can't impose their will on the majority? Doesn't that logic then apply to *every* majority group, and isn't tied to race at all? Do you honestly know nothing about group psychology?   Point out your bias  This would be true if the ultimate goal was a mono-culture, aka 'cultural marxism', or more directly John Rawls system of Justice. Which isn't practical. What is going to do more for group health, continue to split it by focusing on differences, or focus on how you are the same? Cause ultimately that seems to be what the push back is about.   White Guilt  Yep, focusing on white guilt is absolutely not a thing! URL  Trump quip  See, shit like this just shows how caught up in your own biases you are. 99% of what Trump posts is utter bullshit to keep the flames burning. If anything it makes me chuckle because it is such a blatant political move, and either through fear, or your own 'hate' you have to keep chomping on it. Early on he tipped his hand and none of 'you' picked up on it. Early last year a report was released that didn't fit The Narrative, so MSM in general danced around it. Trump, being the glorious bastard that he is, dropped some made up numbers to which the Media instantly jumped on to show just how stupid/ill informed he is by reporting the actual statistics. Low and behold his 'comeback' was 'See, my Twitter is so powerful it forces the MSM to print facts'. Like holy fuck did you guys create this monster, and you continue to. And ffs I am not even a supporter! I am a so called 'bernie bro'.   'Being a dick about this'  You sit there and talk about research when so much of the 'research' has issues.Between the blatant activism pretending to be research to the large following within the 'Social Sciences' that is blatantly anti science! It is almost like the Left took over the schools and forgot that they have the same tendencies as the Right, just for different reasons. Or are you going to honestly sit there and argue that there isn't bias when it comes to the ever continuing nature vs nurture debate, or that large swaths despise evopsych because [reasons]?   Oh, and I also find it hilarious how you have no issues with shitting all over Nationalism, but Collectivism, man, that is the bees knees!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"To address each point in turn:  - Yes AS is part of a community, it's naive for him to suggest otherwise.  - You say 'it is natural for people to have racial bias' a statement I agree with. But then jump into 'all white people are racist'. If racial bias = racism, shouldn't the logical follow on be 'all people are racist'.  - Police violence is disturbing. However, two points to consider. a) Black people are 13% of the population, but 44% of all cop killers. If you are an American cop you are more than 3x more likely to be killed by a black man than a white one. Is police trepidation around black people 'racial bias' or is it a reaction to the realities of their jobs? b) Nearly twice as many white people were killed by police this year by police than black people. Including some unarmed teenagers, such as Dylan Nobel. These killings however are not as heavily publicized by the media.  - The murder of JCA is obviously racially motivated. No-one should suggest that racism no longer exists in America. However, America is not a country where there is an epidemic of white on black crime. Even if you factor in for the actions of white police officers, there are still more white people being killed by black people than visa versa. Saying 'black supremacy has never been a systemic threat to white America' is not accurate. If a black person kills a white person they have violated their civil liberties in the most total way imaginable. The fact that the threat is not system is I doubt much consolations to the white victims of black violence.   - Showing a picture of a prison cell while stating 'white racism is a lot ore harmful' implies that the high rate of incarceration is a result of nothing but white racism. I think the much more obvious answer is that high rates of black incarceration co-inside with high levels of black crime. Arresting people for commuting crimes is not racism.  - I don't deny I, or others have implicit bias. What I (and other anti-SJW's) reject is the notion that these biases are responsible for black rates of criminality, or police violence against black people. Also in regards to trans-phobia - definitions are important. If I said 'Milo Stewart does not dress like a man, look like a man, make any particular effort to act like a man and shows no overtly masculine elements to her persona at all, therefore, she is a woman.' I am sure Milo would call me trans-phobic. I believe that there are genuine transsexuals, but I do not accept I must acknowledge every gender identity that people invent for themselves. That is not a 'phobia', it is a difference of opinion.  - On your final point I could just as easily turn the same argument against liberal/left people. Just because you've worked out that Sarah Palin isn't very bright, and that the God that Christians (of whom many are conservatives, but not all) worship is not real, does not mean that you have debunked conservatism. Or that, even if a Christian can have an irrational belief about the afterlife, doesn't mean that everything they believe is equally false e.g. Ben Carson may be a religious cook, but likely has an IQ higher than either of us. Or to put it another way - I would say the statement 'socialism is a terrible concept, and it has failed everywhere it has ever been tried' is a fairly obvious statement. Arguably a much easier conclusion to arrive at than 'there is no God'. And yet there are millions of educated left-atheists that believe in this failed system with a conviction that approximates the same level of blind faith found among the devoutly religious.  - The rise of nationalism is a response to concerns that many people have about the direction their country is going. As a UK atheist for example I am personally not super happy with the massive levels of Muslim (usually quite fanatically devout) migration into my continent. You're inability to understand why people vote for right wing parties may say more about your own ignorance than any kind of propagandist element out of a small YouTube community. I can promise you that 99.9% of Front National voters don't know who armored Skeptic is.  I admire you desire to engage openly in a debate with AS and other anti-SJW's. You seem more rational than most of your tribe. But this video fails to hit home mostly because it rest upon the idea that we have accepted many of the implicit assumptions of this video (blacks are the victims of whites, nationalist are ignorant, gender identities are social constructs etc.).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I was actually on board with this until you started getting into the racial bias subject. Still well argued, and enjoyable video.  Surely everyone is a little bit racist sometimes when racism is defined as being whatever someone FEELS is racist. Your example for Trump having said something remotely racist was an example of him not saying something that would be an expected response to accusations of racism. So his failure to condemn the KKK can lead some people to assume his motives were racist...but a more rational explanation is not to alienate his voter base -- this fits his MO a bit better than the racist argument to me. I'm not a Trump supporter, either - I think he's a clown, but not a racist -  but there is a very clear trend of using the word 'racist' as a political weapon, and just a general lack of adherence to how serious an accusation that really is.   I've been called racist for saying BLM isn't the answer to a very real problem, and for suggesting that black people aren't the only victims of police brutality - even when I share my own experiences with it as a rebellious white kid living in poverty back in the not so good old days. Whatever core merit there may be to the black lives matter movement is constantly undermined by their own actions and any reasonable person could have predicted violent results. As wealthy as many of them are and more privileged than I've ever been in my life, I'd expect a little more emphasis on community outreach.  I'd expect a deeper focus on education and bringing opportunities closer to these communities. I'd expect some honest discussion about the deeper more impactful causes of racial bias and all the other mere symptoms they focus on.   Why should I get behind a movement that doesn't want to talk about failed integration, the failure of affirmative action and how it's stifled black communities? Why should I get behind a movement who instead of financing the communities it pretends to speak for decides to pour money into itself and block traffic/hijack events and memorial services completely unrelated to their cause to deliberately and unquestionably guilt an entire race with no regard whatsoever for the individuals on either side? Black lives matter as a concept is fine, but as a movement...It's just brazenly bigoted. And we're already seeing the results of that - it's obvious and predictable...racial division. Most of the BLM advocates I interact with directly align themselves with X, and some even outright reject King and his message - this is counter productive in a huge way.   The term racism is so weaponized today it almost doesn't mean anything. The word itself used to immediately stir up emotions in me, but now I know better - you have to dissect every instance of it to distinguish whether it's being used properly or exploited...and honestly it's exploited almost every time these days.   I didn't expect to type out that much, but here we are. I make sure I'm a little drunk when I keyboard warrior all over the place.  Anyway, I'm always happy to stumble upon reasonable responses from people like you even if I don't totally agree so I subbed, great work here.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It's depressingly common among most people who identify as atheists and skeptics that I've met. It's boring. It gave me a good place to work from for the talk, talking about the limited capacity for understanding that any human has and what that means for intellectual humility that allows for deeper understandings.

"Dat Chairman Mao picture in the background. :3  Anywho, this is also a problem here in Europe. Specifically a kind of statistical discrimination. Since immigration to Europe the last 40 years has had a good chunk of immigrants from the Middle-East and other lower-income areas of the world; places that have been rife with war and an inability to educate their population, the immigrants themselves are coming to 1st world countries that are highly specialized and have a need for skilled labor.  The problem is, when you are unskilled and in many cases not even literate in a capitalist society, you will be delegated to the lower rungs of society, and I don't think I need to elaborate on what kind of anomie that can cause among people, because not only do the immigrants come here in most cases seeking a better life and won't get what they hoped for, they are also disrespected in many cases because the statistics actually do say that immigrants overall have it worse off than others. So the native population actually might feel a form of justification in treating foreigners differently, because they are statistically on average less educated and literate, and this is also a form of bias that might not take the form of direct physical violence or screaming sandnigger on a street corner, but it certainly does influence people's behavior; maybe in the form of not employing people who are foreign, or giving them a chance to succeed and get educated properly.  That's not to say that those explicit racist attacks don't happen. They do, but I would argue far less than than the other kind.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"The anti-whatever YouTube brolosophy crowd is essentially a product of the highly-sophisticated western inculcation engine (whose epicenter resides in the US). These people have had their behaviors & opinions installed for them _long_ before they began regurgitating them en masse onto a global interconnected network where poison proliferates at a _far_ greater speed than cure. We're talking about *full grown adults* running around calling each other 'sjw's', 'regressives', 'cucks', and all sorts of other dummy-lingo here. A learned individual might be tempted to say that no educated person could take such people seriously. But the problem with that is that _this is what the education system_ IS. From K-12 (in addition to the 24-hour cycle of behavioral conditioning people receive from other mainstream outlets). It isn't that many of these people aren't intelligent or articulate, it's that brainwashing does not discriminate.  Even the most intelligent of people are vulnerable to it. Creel & Bernays (the architects of the system that has led to these YouTube reactionaries clamoring for their own economic subjugation) understood this very well, since 1917 in fact..... Together with all the psychologists they hired for the task, they demonstrated to the world how easy it is to manipulate people, almost effortlessly moving their thoughts and opinions around like chess-pieces. Except unlike Chess, this is a _game of distraction_, designed to keep people perpetually at one another's jugulars, usually over trivialities. This of course, so that the people who're doing the most massive damage in this world can continue to luxuriate in their totally unaccountable status at the expense of billions.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

A whole racist movement renamed to something else basically because it seems more PC? I feel like most anti feminists and anti SJW's(Sjews if you prefer hbomber and his terminology) are deeply offended should there ever be an indication that society as run predominantly by white dudes isn't perfect in its treatment of other groups and are the first to shout misandry and bigotry in general, but if anyone else complains of bigotry or misogyny, the immediate response is to stop being whiny victim card holding panseys and grow a backbone  I'd call it bizarre if it weren't so typical of history.

"You're one of the more sane people that makes these kinds of claims, but the ones who also make a lot of these claims say that we live in a white supremacist patriarchy that determines everything in the world and all it does is keep the other down.  That's simply not true when there are other demographics who do better than white people as a whole, such as Asians(the American version of the term and the British version of the term) on every single metric.  Hell, according to the LA Times, Asians are actually penalized when taking the SATs by 50 points.  Blacks and latinos are actually given additional points, and whites it's just the score you get.  You tell a white kid who grew up in a majority black neighborhood and got bullied a lot that he has white privilege, he will look you in the eye and tell you to fuck off.  You may not want anyone to feel bad, but there are multiple people who will use terms like 'white privilege' as a cludgen to try and make people feel guilty.  If you remember in his thing about black lives matter commandments, the last one is no matter what you do you are still racist.  A lot of people who say this will also say 'racism=power+privilege.  When people are confronted with that it's reasonable for people to throw up their hands and just say 'Fuck it, can't win with you, not going to try'.  Also, I would have to look at the studies, but with the sentencing discrepancies do they compare like to like?  Did they compare the white kid from similar socioeconomic places to the black and latino criminals?  Did they control for that or did they use the raw data overall and show the discrepancy?  Blacks and latinos tend to live in poorer neighborhoods and crime does happen more in poorer areas.  Though my question is, is the discrepancy because of racism or more because of classism.  As in are they targeting these areas because of race or because they are poor and don't have the political power really to fight back?  Nobody is denying that racism exists, we are questioning how much is really influencing society and if it truly is a barrier to advancement.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Do you think that genuinely racist people who routinely say and do hateful things, like that klansman with a shotgun pictured in your video, should come to feel some level of guilt and shame about their behavior and attitude if they ever change their mind and adopt the more socially acceptable attitude of tolerance?  I think that they should.  In fact, I do not see how they could manage not to.  That seems to present a significant lost distinction when conflating being racist with having an inherent racial bias, as Milo does.  You end up talking past people who condemn racism.  It complicates things even more when there are people on Milo's side of the argument (if not Milo himself) strongly suggesting that people SHOULD feel ashamed based on characteristics they are born with and cannot change.  I appreciate that bias exists in the criminal justice system and elsewhere which negatively impacts minorities disproportionately.  I want that to change.  I will try to help when I can, and part of that is acknowledging it exists.  However, I feel that several of the specific complaints of the BlackLivesMatter movement proponents, especially those organizing on college campuses, are petty and hyperbolic; sometimes to the point of bigotry.

"Cool video, Nyk. You made some good points in this one and made me laugh. I think the only thing I'd say in response is that while there may still be various race and gender issues to tackle in America (and the West more generally) they're usually quite small these days and the outrage we see is often way out of proportion.  For example, the trans community often voices it's upset with people using the wrong pronouns. While it may be a valid issue, it's such a small issue that I'd argue it shouldn't require such an aggressive reaction. It does irritate me when trans people, or women, or whoever act as if the whole world is consciously and systematically trying to hold them down, because from what I can see that's not true. Whenever these issues arise governments are usually very understanding to the point where sometimes the solution can go too far and minorities can be given extra privileges.  But I'd completely accept anti-SJWs can go too far as well. The whole Milo outrage was ridiculous. I'd rather stick to challenging issues like whether Trudeau's gender balanced cabinet could be regard as discrimination against men and ability based on a preference for humans with X chromosomes.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"My problem is that racism is being redefined by Milo to be synonymous with 'racial bias'. I don't know, call me crazy, but calling it a racial bias is a hell of a lot easier than trying to redefine the definition of racism held by the majority of people.   All people are racially biased - arguable, but a reasonable idea to posit All people are racist - co-opting racism to make the definition so broad that it loses its potency  By so broadly redefining racism, it risks undermining the potency of the word. In the same way I dislike when the word 'rape' is used casually to mean anything other than actual rape. Jokes being an exception, due to subjectivity.   Milo was conflating racial bias with racism. I can agree the former exists. To call it racism is ultimately self-defeating.  I'm glad you agree that Gazi Kodzo is clearly a racist, and that black people **can** be racist. Racism shouldn't be redefined so it gives one group carte blanche to act in one way and be able to call it something else to diminish its seriousness.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
