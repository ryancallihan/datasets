"People seem to forget that being overweight isn't being a lazy pig. It's an eating disorder caused by deep mental and emotional pain. It's a coping mechanism. If you take away the coping mechanism they will easily just fall back into it. People who are overweight need to be shown love and support so they can work through their emotional pain. And also no one is above this. We all have coping mechanisms to dull the pain of life and for most of us they are unhealthy. Those of us who don't use food as a coping mechanism are just lucky because no one can see on our bodies what we use as a drug.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I love you and your videos Natalie, but this one is a bit naive in my opinion, especially considering people with eating disorders - that part after eating 2 and a half big macs could be a real trigger for people with bulimia and compulsive eating. I've been reading more and more about that and something that many psychiatrists, therapists and nutritionists have been enforcing is that restrictive diets do not work - in fact, they could make everything worse. People who go under a restrictive diet have 95% of chance to regain the weight they lost or even gain more than they used to. It could lead to eating disorders like anorexia, bulimia and this new orthorexia thing too. There's a huge movement talking about how we should reconnect to our bodies, feelings and necessities to understand what is to be hungry and what is to be emotionally eating. People who lived their lives always on a diet have difficulty to know when they are truly hungry and how hungry they are. The same goes when it's about satisfaction - they don't know when the meal was enough or when to stop because you are satisfied. Your ability to stop at the second and a half burger is like an achievement for people with compulsion. It's a very complicated subject and I love that you try to change the meaning of obesity, but I don't know if I agree with your solution. Your other video about beauty was beautiful and precise, your arguments evolved a lot too. So it would be great to see if you could talk about body neutrality and intuitive eating for instance and what are your views upon this movement against body shaming (being it for its weight, its ethnicity, its gender or anything). Have you heard about it? I would love to hear more from you. I have been reading Naomi Wolf and she has great insights about thinness and beauty standards as an strategy to control women (and here I consider any women, trans or cis) from her bodies since our minds were set free.

"Part of the problem with the obesity crisis is the normalisation of obesity and being overweight.  We're now expecting magazines and television to embrace 'body-type diversity', we praise magazines who feature obese people on their covers (and conversely condemn those who don't do this) and we're telling people to love your body how matter what. All this contributes to the normalisation of obesity.  We're told we should see more overweight and obese people in the media because this represents real body shapes. But the fact that so many people (perhaps most) are now overweight or obese isn't a reason to promote, and therefore normalise this body type.  Suppose most people had missing or discoloured teeth. Would that be a reason to see more bad teeth in the media, so we're reflecting what's real? Would anyone advocate for this? Of course not!  Why would an overweight or obese person feel a need to loose weight if their weight and body is considered normal. If they're just like everyone else, where's the urgency? The answer is there isn't any urgency and therefore we find ourself exactly where we are now: an obesity crisis.  In contrast, if we promote and encourage appropriate body weight, which means not endorsing those who are overweight, and we see less people that are overweight, it should become clearer to society that something must be done sooner when we do start to gain too much weight.  None of this means we should shame anyone or make them feel bad, nor does it mean we shouldn't recognise the various reasons why people gain weight and the difficulties in losing it. But not doing these things doesn't mean we should embrace ideas, actions or policies that normalise or even promote obesity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I feel like your point of 'I don't think it's any of my goddamn business what other people do with their bodies' is really underdeveloped and easily attacked.  It's not about some authoritarian ruling on what people do/don't have the *right* to do; it's about what sort of society you want to live in.  Obesity has been (through scientific study) linked to all sorts of negative effects that, at best, you could paint as a trade-off for whatever a person might perceive as a benefit of being obese.  It really is pretty trivial to paint an argument against the normalization of being fat, and so attacking only people who are motivated by malice is a pretty poor defense of the idea of 'fat acceptance'.  What you see other people doing influences your own decisions about what sort of behavior is and isn't okay, even when you aren't informed enough to understand all of the consequences or options, and as you point out in your own video, becoming a healthy weight after you're already fat is a difficult task.   By attacking people for attacking the normalization of being overweight, you're exacerbating the problem, which you can really only defend if you want to fully throw up your hands and say that society isn't your problem, which would be directly contradictory to basically every other video on this channel.  Given, this video is pretty old at this point, so this is more left here for posterity; it's for all of the future viewers of the video more than anything.

"I'm glad you made this video. I think I have finally found a video of yours that doesn't change my perspective. Don't get me wrong, you're totally correct about these bullies, but I don't follow their ideology.  Maybe I'm a bad person, but my distaste for fat people isn't for their health. I find, probably confirmed by my bias, that often being fat is a symptom of poor discipline and behaviour patterns. Patterns that come through the personality as whole. Maybe not on a casual social level, but more probably if you live with them, or are related to them for example.  I find fat people to be largely unmotivated, more focused on instant gratification, quick to give up in the face of difficulty, and quick to justify their own poor foresight as a personal attack.  While most humans are like this, I find fat people to present this behaviour more, not just in diet, but with money, and other areas of their lifestyle. Making them more difficult roommates than someone who has the discipline to exercise, clean up after themselves, and delay gratification by saving, or not being indebted in anyway.  But that's just my anecdotal experience with a larger than average, but still relatively small sample size.  So I'm going to go ahead and assume that obesity is a symptom of personality flaws, so I will appropriately lower my expectations of your social capacity to maintain a harmonious environment.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I actually unsubscribed from Blair and ShoeonHead after they both decided to give their opinions and make videos about Fat acceptance and Thin Privilege.   I started gaining weight in fourth grade.  Trips to doctors didn't help.  Riding the bus was a nightmare.  I walked everywhere.  Basketball to try and help.  In high school it was even more.  Weights class 2-3 times a week, walking everywhere, marching band.  I found that eating 'diet like' foods at school would actually get me more bullying. (I started dieting in fourth grade.) Eventually via trial and error I found that eating lunch at school that was neither the worst option (pizza, burger etc.  ) or the 'best' option (salad) was my go to.  A milk, a chicken sandwich and a bag of fries.  I took my not eating to home.  After high school I got more intense.  I worked jobs that needed lots of exercise and moving around and went to the gym 5 hours a week.  I gained 10 pounds. . my breasts got smaller.  Nothing else changed.  I tried out for Biggest Loser 3 times.  They could fix anyone right?  Never got in.  I got married to a man that said prayer and more God would solve it.  9 years later and 1 divorce later I started seeing a new doctor.  A fat disorder doctor.  I have Stage III Lipedema.  Obesity is in my family.  My Uncle died from Gastric Bypass.  From complications that aren't advertised by doctors or insurance readily. (Gastric Bypass and GERD causing Esophageal Cancer) Losing weight just. . isn't in my future and never will be unless I can get insurance to pay for surgeries.

"I definitely agree with you on the excuse to bully people issue and the certain political figures doing this as well, like Milo(the man is crazy). But I think a lot of the argument on the other side comes from the ideology that we should encourage that kind of behavior.    The best example of this is probably Tess Holliday. For those that don't know Tess is a body positive activist and model. She is about 200 pounds over her frame making her morbidly obese. The issue her is I've read some of the comments in her videos of people saying they want to stay big because they have never been happier. This is where the line becomes skewed because you are directly encouraging the type of behavior. Of course we should never bully these individuals, but we need to stand on a viewpoint where we all need to acknowledge this is neither healthy nor safe.  We have already done that with smoking. It's clear about the health effects of smoking. That's why no one is glamorizing it. If obesity is the second leading cause of preventable after smoking why are we all the sudden encouraging.  Of course I'm not saying you should be yelling at random overweight people on street(you weirdo), or laughing at them in YouTube videos, you just need to have an understanding that what they are doing is not good for them and it will ruin their joints and possibly shorten their lifespan.

"America's diet culture is really quite toxic. I've always had a normal, healthy weight (perhaps slightly curvy for an Asian girl - smaller waist and bigger boobs and hips). Back in China, other than thinking that I'm a bit bigger than the girls around me (but I'm also quite athletic), I never perceived myself as fat. Then, ironically, I moved to the US for grad school, where the average BMI is higher than China, and developed an eating disorder. I started having unrealistic expectations for an 'ideal' body type (and that's the real trick, isn't it - that all the healthy life gurus are telling you that you CAN achieve that body and that it's all about your personal effort - plus buying their PT guides/consultations). On top of an already busy and stressful schedule, I tried to fit in as many workout sessions as possible. When I failed to achieve them, I resorted to eating, which made me feel worse. I became bulimic although from the outside, I seemed normal and perhaps healthier/more active than average. I was experiencing shame that even my uber-critical Chinese parents couldn't have made me feel. And that's when I realized how warped the diet culture is in the US. I actually moved here from a slimmer country (statistically speaking), as a perfectly healthy person, and started to hate my body due to the pervasive influence of mass media, which I didn't even expose myself to that much. And that's why I think that body positivity is important.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is a great video, the only problem I have is to tell obese people who lost weight that it's nearly impossible for them to keep it off. I think it takes a lot of work dedication and discipline, but some of us have kept our weight off for a while and we would appreciate people who would be our allies not to tell us, that in the end we'll never make it.  I know there are studies, that back up that point, but there are also many examples of people who have kept the weight off long-term, I'm talking many years. Maybe I will include a study later if I can find one, 'officially'. But I have known quite a few in my life and I intend to be one of them.  people focusing on negative Studies, who are just starting their journey, May find it discouraging. they may think 'if I'm destined to be fat anyway then why bother being healthy?' And while I may be still heavier than some of my peers, I have gotten a huge health benefit from losing weight, look way better and toned, and may want to add, that instead of telling people it's impossible to keep it off, it may be more accurate, to say that you have to be very incremental.  You should NOT be losing 40 pounds in four months (unless you're morbidly obese)  Someone like me, who lost 40 pounds in three years, might be better off because my body has gotten used to a certain size.

"I agree with you on most other topics but not this one. I'm certainly not in favor of fat shaming or bullying, and you're quite right to slam the vile behavior of these 'tough love' self-proclaimed fat-shamers. However, the idea of rebranding obesity as a 'celebration of excess', while well-meaning, is not much better. I certainly wouldn't take that stance about any other lifestyle choices that are actively harmful and I suspect you wouldn't either. Would you celebrate your friend's gambling addiction? Drug abuse? Self-harm? I think not.   The idea that for many people it's impossible to lose weight even if they try is wrong and harmful in almost all cases (the exceptions being crippling disabilities and some rare diseases). That's very similar to the self-perpetuating philosophy of incels you talk about in another video: it's a comforting falsehood that causes people to wallow in their problems instead of taking steps to improve their situation. And as much as I sympathize with that, I cannot support or encourage that kind of self-destructive behavior.   If you want to argue that not everyone has to be healthy, that's fine by me. I'm not going to tell any fat person that they have an obligation to eat less or exercise more, that's their decision (at least until global warming causes food shortages and it's no longer morally defensible to eat more than you need, but that's another story). But that decision to remain overweight should be taken consciously, with the knowledge that there is a genuine alternative.    I'm not saying that everyone can have a model's figure, and I agree that society sets unfair standards. Chasing perfection is not the answer either. However I firmly believe that the vast majority of people can achieve a reasonably healthy weight, if they want it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Thank you for this video, great take on the subject. Personally I am overweight because of a trauma and I just eat to suppress my fears, anger and other negative emotions (consequentially, positive emotions are also being suppressed by that). Although I am working on my trauma, I realize when I start to eat healthy, those emotions come out in full force. Although I have had several setbacks in losing weight because of it, I'm determined to face my fears and trauma and get healthy again. Luckily I have supportive people around me, because if people would fat shame me, I would have to eat the shame and hate away... I have learned to like myself even though I'm fat, but I know it's not healthy so I still want to get to a healthy weight. I just know I will never be a skinny top model, and that is fine by me :).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Obviously, both are nonsense on a biological level.'    It was meant as a critique of race, but honestly, doesn't it work as a critique of our attitudes about body type? A significant percentage of any given population are born with more adipose cells and therefore the tendency to weigh more, have a thicker body type and have more difficulty losing weight. Is it not a type of racism, then, to marginalize people based (potentially) on unchangeable, hereditary facts of their biology?

"Fat-shaming _IS_ bullying! I got picked on a lot before my weight loss journey, almost everyday by students in my school and it only made things worse for me because I was an emotional eater. Only after graduating and being surrounded with supportive people and loving myself I started dieting and exercising. One day (after losing 30 pounds) I met a group of old friends and they were all telling me how beautiful I look, except this one girl who used to harass me daily, she actually said 'omg you've gained a lot! Go to the gym, it's good for your health!' Everyone looked at her like she was crazy because I'd clearly lost weight, not gained it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"When I was in college I was in an LGBTQ health class and my professor said there's absolutely no connection between obesity and health and that obese people are perfectly healthy it's our culture that has the problem. I disagreed because I'm a bit of a nutrition junky and obesity is associated with a lot of health risks HOWEVER I also pointed out that obesity can be caused by a variety of factors from diet and exercise to composition of the microbiome and exposure to a virus in chickens, heavy metals or BPA. I think the hard part is that there are some assholes who judge people for being overweight without realizing how complicated it is and in response a lot of people who work there asses off to stay healthy but can't lose the weight respond with fat positivity which I think is positive psychologically but unfortunately the risks of obesity are still real I just have a hard time with the people that are fat positive and ignore the risks it seems unfair to people who may not know the chance for diseases that are higher I'm not trying to be a bully or anything I know it's very complicated I just think there needs to be a nuanced way to say obesity is unhealthy but it's not your fault it's very complicated and fuck any asshole who judges you.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I wish Natalie had gone into weight and class... To drastically oversimplify:  When you're poor you are both stressed and generally have access to crappier foods.    Because you're stressed when you are poor, you will tend to eat more, and eat more highly palatable foods.  These foods are higher in calories and fat.  Stressed rats will also overeat highly palatable foods.  Being poor means what you can afford to eat tends to be cheap, fatty, starchy, and high in calories.  It also tends to be more available to where you live.  So.  Poor people are more likely to be fat in Western society.  Therefore thinness is associated with the upper classes, wealth, desirability, intelligence, and a good work ethic. Thin people are thought to be smarter and more hardworking. Poor people AND fat people are thought to be dumber, lazier, and to deserve social disapproval.   Fat people suffer from job discrimination, so they make less money on average. They are less likely to go to college because their parents are less likely to help them go. Anyway, just had to add this...","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"In all seriousness, there still remains the fact that obesity is a major health concern in this country. The body still has a limit at which point it will slowly die from unhealthy food, and lack of exercise  brought on from excess weight. Hence why you really don't see many morbidly Obese 70 year olds.  To say that they're health their business is patently false as well, as taxpayers do end up paying indirectly for medical bills brought on by health problems.  Plus, many loved ones of people do indeed have the right to concern themselves with the health of the person, as they benefit from the well being of their loved ones.  Still is not an excuse for bullying, but promoting health in the general public should be a priority, even if it involves telling a person that their lifestyles are Killing them and they should be healthier, same goes with smoking and drug addiction.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Obesity comes from childhood trauma as well.  The fat serves as emotional/physical protection.  It can feel like a warm hug if the child had been neglected sweetness and love from the parents.  They find the sweetness in foods instead.  Perhaps the reason why weight is so hard to loose is because there are deeply buried emotional issues that don't let them loose weight.  They would have to totally change the way they cope with everyday life and painful memories.  Or they would have to drastically change their lives in order to make it so that there is less suffering they have to cope with.  I wholeheartedly believe many people with medical issues would benefit from seeing a good therapist before doing any surgeries.   The idea that shaming works is so stupid.  If emotional or physical pain, through the form of shaming and punishment is what caused people to become obese as a coping mechanism, shaming them would just make them put on more weight as a way to cope and protect themselves.   In order to help someone you have to extend understanding and compassion to them.  You have to enter into their perspective.  You shouldn't hypothesize what you would do if you were them.  You should try to imagine what it is like being them as them.  Removing all your childhood experiences and becoming curious about what they might have experienced, and filling in the gaps with your imagination.  It's basic empathy, imagining what its like to be another person. Right wing people must have really low IQs because emotional understanding is like the easiest thing out of all the mental capacities a human has.  They are assholes, so disconnected from their own emotions and their own suffering, that they can't relate to anyone else. I know retribution would be sinking down to their level but I sometimes imagine if they are met with an awful event in their life, they will some how have no other choice but to come face to face with their suffering and finally get it.  They will finally have to break down, let their life fall apart and grieve.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I know this is an old video, but I just want to chime in because I used to be 425 pounds. I'm currently 292 and continuing on my way down. It's been a long journey with a lot of ups and downs. Some months I lost 10 pounds, others I lost only 3, then back to 10. Honestly, one of the biggest things that helps with something like weight loss is having a supportive network of friends and family. When you have nothing at all and food is the only thing that can provide you a bit of comfort even if you know you are killing yourself, you may just decide to eat more. I have friends and family who want me to be well and I want to be well, and I want to live the longest, happiest, and healthiest life I can - and this is what has kept me on the right track for the last nearly two years.   Now let me get one thing straight - I want to be the healthiest me regardless of what anyone says. If people have a problem with me, I can shrug it off - but not everyone is in the same position as I am and they won't all react to stressors like bullying in the same way that I will. As contra mentioned in the video, it often just makes people worse off. When a lot of people bully you about something and make you feel worthless and miserable, you retreat to the habits that you know are bad for you but provide you at least some comfort...

"I think the message of fat acceptance is very irresponsible but at the same time the solution to the problem it somehow tries to alleviate obviously isn't to bully people. I think there is some idea in consciously assessing the culture we build around being overweight, if you want the people of tomorrow to not suffer excess misery from obesity you'd probably want to try to fix the epidemic itself but also to keep the condition as socially neutral like any other disease so that you don't hurt people too much in the process. I think the goal would be to build something where obesity doesn't spread, but something that also doesn't make people who are fat any more miserable. The idea of 'health' is itself debatable of course but one thing is sure, being overweight increases your risk of almost any possible disease (weakened immune system and overworked organs make your response to viral threat, strain, etc. considerably weaker), early mortality and probably even most importantly worse quality of life. Being obese or heavily overweight is a disability and debilitates you in all physical activity to some extent. Also the obvious markers of worsened quality of life are the somewhat increased likelihoods of different mental illnesses like depression, but even most obvious of all are the self-reports of obese people, especially those who have since lost the weight. I am one of those people and I can say that being overweight was way more debilitating than many would think, fat tissue is an active organ that effects your hormone production, especially when it comes to eating and mood. It's at least a vicious cycle where you get hungry faster and don't feel full when you should as you eat since insulin disrupts your leptin production and function. I'll put it bluntly, you feel like shit all the time and if you've been fat since you were a kid you probably think that it's normal to feel that way. When I lost my first significant amount of weight I felt like superman. Also it's an almost impossible mental gauntlet to feel crushing personal failure every single time you come across some stairs and know that it's your problem that you're paying for in those instances. Nobody forcibly made you fat even if you want to shift the blame to someone else, your environment makes a difference but at the same time it is your personal vessel so after a certain age it becomes your problem no matter how it started. I wouldn't want it for my worst enemies.  What does it mean to be overweight has fluctuated over the years from positively symbolizing wealth to negatively symbolizing greed to now symbolizing or being evidence of sloth and gluttony.  I don't think the solution is to throw in the towel and begin accepting it as a new norm, our children and their children are the ones that'd get screwed over with that, culture matters since it's the legacy we leave to those we care about the most. I think it is very similar to if the opioid epidemic got even more out of hand, and addicts being large enough portion of the population, we'd start opioid drug addiction acceptance or we'd at least shift the condition to something of a neutral character trait and not a value judgement or a condition to treat. It's ok that the most likely cause of death for an American is a drug overdose because everyone does it, it's almost unavoidable since the drugs are everywhere and they're addicting, of course it's normal since chasing highs is human nature #SICC  Sure that would be a coping strategy but it doesn't promote solving the ultimate problem and it doesn't take into account that there will be loads of generations of people after us and this is not a direction you'd want to lead them if you had any sense.  There is no doubt a social element to the condition so I deem it very unwise and irresponsible to move goalposts towards excess weight being something to celebrate, I think among adults it could be good to see the fatness issue as a matter of personal responsibility, so who cares if you're fat as long as you don't make your kids fat, but I think actual intentional campaigning or a 'movement' that shifts the wider culture around it is just plain social degradation and self-centered egoism. Culture is what we give to children so that they don't have to start building morals and knowledge independently from the ground up, not seriously warning them about proven bad habits and negative coping strategies is an idiotic idea, when they finally learn it'll be too late for them since health affects you from day one. Childhood obesity is a heavy negative predictor of overall lifetime success and at that point it is not personal choice, it's beyond vile to even take the risk of raising its prevalence without a seriously good reason for doing so and I don't think the blind professed empathy in the name of hypothetical social justice is good enough.

"Why not use someone non controversial like Michelle Obama once in this entire video? Her entire career as FLOTUS was fighting obesity and she's arguably the most influential and recognizable face of the movement. Hell what about President Clinton Jillian Michaels Gordan Ramsay Jamie Oliver Beyonce or literally anyone else fighting the good fight against obesity? You just used the standard YouTube dumpster fires.   Now if this video was called something else that specifically referenced the 'I'm so edgy' body shaming of the shittube creators, I would have no issue. But the way it's presented is 'only someone like Milo Yiannapolis could have a problem with fat acceptance' 'this is only far right edgelord shit' and I refuse to believe you don't understand framing or connotation. Maybe you're just reacting to the disguising of bullying as compassion, but it really feels like you're just trying to discredit anyone concerned with obesity.   Like are we just going to avoid the fact that millennials are the most obese generation in history. And I'm sorry but anyone telling you there is no link between obesity and, say, taking a heart attack at 35 is selling you hamburgers.   See we are about to be in this crisis situation where up to a third of Americans WILL drop dead within the next decade. Globally this issue is almost as bad as climate change but no one is willing to have the conversation because they don't want to look rude. Our working population already cannot sustain the retiring population, and we are about to see an unprecedented reduction in that already low number of earners.   Also not to be rude to Natalie but I'm pre sure she's always been a skinny bitch. I used to be over 300 lbs and I've kept myself in the 170 range for 5 years now by body fat percentage is currently at around 16% where it used to be 35%. I'm not a superhuman mutant who achieved an impossible feat but this discussion is very much my wheelhouse.   I would have lost the weight sooner but hearing this 'obese in remission' 'it's just going to come back' bullshit really had me feeling hopeless for a long time. It's hogwash, a myth, those stats have largely been disproven, and promoting that sort of fatalist incel sui-fuel is blatantly irresponsible. Your body reflects your lifestyle and when you make sustainable lifestyle changes... you actually sustain the changes reflected in your body. These studies proving 'obesity in remission' generally focused on crash dieters, biggest loser-type weight loss, lipo, gastric bypass, cool sculpting, and other quick fixes. However the way people talk about it promotes this ridiculous idea that fatness is genetic or inescapable (it's not).   I also learned, growing up in a hyper polite culture enabling my slow suicide, that compliments paid by others were bullshit, and I could only ever trust the bully in my head. I think THAT is where real mental health concerns and body dysmorphia comes in, I can tell other people to fuck off but not really my second self. Like I really was killing myself and everyone who 'loved' me was smiling along while I was doing it. That's some seriously deep cruelty if you really think about it.  I think it's very important to talk about the causes of obesity, and it really is a complicated conversation. Like on one hand capitalism promotes shitty food and our over worked schedules don't leave much room, but at the same time I'm a poor person I can tell you right now that a healthy diet is a lot cheaper than daily takeout (which we are seeing a lot of) and a quick google search brings up millions of healthy budget friendly 5 minute recipes so I don't really see 'society' as being the answer. At the same time, people en mass didn't decide to just get really fat to freak everyone out. I don't think the rise of services like Uber eats is helping though...   Like, I live under universal health care and a healthcare crisis where people are literally dying in ER waiting rooms while hospitals are closed some days out of the week. So I do sort of feel like there is a collective responsibility to make healthy decisions so healthcare is accessible to all, I don't think that you should be penalized for not making those choices dgmw, but at a basic karmic level understand that a little girl died of lukemia because the doctors were busy with your angina surgery at 34 because you can't stay away from McDonalds for more than 4 hours.   I half feel like uploading a reaction video to this, it's the only video of yours I've vehemently and constantly disagreed with and I can't write it all out. In terms of reckless ideology, I place fat acceptance up there with climate change denial or 'race realism' and I'm not trying to be unnecessarily inflammatory.

"I speak only for myself. I'm 47 and have been fat for roughly 40 of those years. There's a constant internal dialogue I have which is basically me repeating the mantra, 'I've got to do something about this.' over and over and over. It's always there. Once, in my 30's I starved myself to about 1400 cal per day and worked my ass off. I made a spreadsheet to doc every bite of food, and every excercise cal burned-I tracked fiber, cal, fat. I lost enough to return to my high school level of fat...about 30-40 lbs overweight. I felt like a superhero until I gained it all back and then some. What does not ever help is some asshole telling me what I need to do. I fucking know what works, and it requires life-alteringly obsessive behavior.

"I agree entirely with your comment that fat shaming is just another excuse for bullies. I do not agree that we should accept 'weight diversity' as if it were like cultural diversity. Excessive weight is bad for health, not just socially different. When you start arguing that people should accept their own excessive weight, you give them an excuse to not make the effort to lose it. I think programmes like 'Biggest Loser' were helpful in making people aware that obesity can be controlled, and Yes, by self-discipline. As you point out, obesity has skyrocketed since the 1960s in the USA (but not everywhere e.g., southern Europe). I was recently in Paris queueing for two hours to climb the steps to the roof of Notre Dame, and spent the time observing the pedestrians. When obese people walked past, they were, almost inevitably, Americans. Here in Europe, we have national health services. The problem is that there is more and more discussion about spending obesity, which means that resources that should be channelled into fighting real diseases are used to help people who are fat.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Underlying this fat-shaming business is the notion that a woman's only value or primary value is in her looks.  Thus, Jenny McCarthy is an anti-vaccine nut who should be shunned out of the public sphere because her stupidity is a threat to children, but people still want to know what she thinks because she is considered conventionally good-looking.  But on the other hand, a woman could be recognized for an important contribution to humanity through, say, a Nobel prize, and people all over the world will respond to the announcement of her prize with 'Yeah, but is she good-looking?'  This causes fat-shaming to do a lot more damage than it should.  I'm a fat man and it's obvious that fat-shaming hurts me a lot less than it does fat women.  I don't know that we spend enough time talking about how these various cultural assumptions twist and distort and generally fuck things up.

"i feel like most of the comments here are still missing the point entirely.  contra and fat acceptance people are not saying that we should promote unhealthy lifestyles and that being morbidly obese should be glorified or fetishized. no one is saying you have to date a morbidly obese person, or be attracted to one to be a fat acceptor.   apparently some of you still think that EVERYONE who eats healthy and exercises should be able to become thin, or they are not trying hard enough. this is simply not true. for whatever reason, genetics, bone density, disability, other health conditions like depression, anxiety, or thyroid issues may inhibit a person with a healthy lifestyle from fitting in a ridged BMI box. like contra says, MOST PEOPLE CANNOT BE A SIZE 0 NO MATTER HOW HARD THEY TRY. and those that do - models, actors, it's their entire lifestyle and career.   'health at every size' doesn't mean morbidly obese people should be considered healthy. it means healthy lifestyles should be promoted first, for the benefit of people's personal lives, and that people should not be judged to be irresponsible binge eaters when they aren't a size 0. look on any social media platform, you will see PLENTY of people who are called fat and heavy and told to diet when they aren't even overweight; they just aren't model-thin.   fat shaming is real, and that fact that people who aren't even overweight are still shamed and assumed to be unhealthy because they don't fit into an unattainable beauty standard is the proof.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There are so many people in the comments saying, 'Yeah. I agree with not bullying people but I still think be fat is bad and we shouldn't accept it.' But what most people either fail or refuse to realise is that this whole goddamn, facist-like culture we have about people 'not being healthy' is the dumbest thing since judging people based on their looks on whether or not to consider them human.  No one will ever be 'healthy'. There will always be something that is factoring in on how you behave and look and how that effects your life span. There are plenty of people of have mental illness that are treated in the same freaking way as fat people; they're told to 'control your thoughts' and eat right and then they'll be magically cured. They're also bullied to no end, and hate the fact that they're mental illness is something that they can't escape from without help, or even ever.  All afflictions of the human health are things we usually cannot control and are given to us by external factors. If we choose to make ourselves sick, then fine. Some people don't want to live long, or in a typical way like most of you think. And anyone who doesn't abide to being 'healthy' is shunned out of society as if they were some sort of cattle that doesn't deserve rights or even to be seen as it would taint the precious normal people.  There is no normal in this universe. Randomness is built in (at least from what we can tell now), and that's why we should represent as many individuals as we can in media, and why we SHOULD accept fatness and other parts of human life so we can goddamn make people not feel like shit and let more of us live in a happier way.

"I find it fascinating how almost everyone in the US seems to agree that hard work and good education is all that is needed to be rich, but deny that the same is true for being in good shape, while in fact exactly the opposite is true.  Unless you are one of the very, very few unlucky people with some weird genetic defect, regular exercise, active lifestyle and healthy food enjoyed in moderation *will* keep you lean.  But it is very easy to remain poor even though you have an university degree and work very hard. Decreasing lower percentile income, increasing tuition costs, fake self-employment...  Also fascinating that a high rate of obesity and morbid obesity strongly correlate with the 'American way of life'.  As soon as countries decide cars are the only acceptable way of transportation, fast food chains a good daily source of food, and coke a good thing to drink to every meal - partly because it saves a lot of time for the part of the population now working 50h a week, and saves a lot of money for the rest that now is unemployed - the fat epidemic beginns.

"Fat hate is a battleground over the existence of free will. I've often wondered about why I instinctively feel prejudiced against people who are very overweight, and my conclusion is that I am somewhat threatened by them. We know that fat people do not want to be fat, and we also know that on a purely physical level, they have the ability to stop being fat (a person who simply stops eating entirely will lose weight fairly quickly, we can be sure of that). But, generally speaking, they continue to remain overweight. This presents a philosophical dilemma. I want to believe that people have the ability to make choices, and have the ability to act rationally and logically despite discomfort. The simple existence of overweight people is a visual, human reminder that for at least some people, that simply isn't true. And the same thinking that says 'if they can do it, I can do it too!' leads me to to the unnerving 'if they can't do it, perhaps I couldn't either'. As a person with a lifetime of good eating habits for which I must thank my upbringing, a low appetite, and naturally tall (thus increasing my need for calories) - it is easy to project these insecurities on a group whose problems I can't identify with.    I think there is a desire to 'do something', and I think most people who are 'fat haters' ultimately agree on this deep down - I don't care about fat people, really (perhaps individuals, but not the group). I simply would prefer there to be less fat people. This kind of self centred thinking does not take the individuals concerned into account, and leads easily to shaming - which, ironically, doesn't seem to be effective - but is easy and feels good. The shaming leads naturally from the desire to believe in free will and control - I want to believe I perfectly control my body and actions. They must also be able to control their body and actions. They do something that harms themselves? The psychologically easiest conclusion is they are simply weak or stupid, and thus contemptible. Thus I can protect my feelings and ideals at the expense of compassion. This is a trade most people are willing to make.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

An I wonder how it must be for a person that wights maybe  250 lb. I know there is room for improvement, and I won't lie that I don't feel attracted to obese people.

"I get that fat shaming can be traumatic but in small doses it can be helpful. My dad does this but not in an abusive or intentionally hurtful way, but out of love. I am thankful for it. What you suggest is we tell people that there is nothing wrong with stuffing your mouth with utter excess  till we become almost indistinguishable  from a hog. I was getting there and I felt terrible for it. I wasn't obese because of genetics or environmental factors but simply because I ate in extreme excess and that is NOT OKAY. Now before people attack me, I do realise there are people that it's really not much of an option for to just lose weight through some healthier eating and exercise like myself (my own mother being one of these people) but to encourage the morbidly obese who's sole problem is sloth and gluttony is not okay and I will never support such nonsense. Be against fat shaming all you want but total fat acceptance is neither the solution.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"here is a thought from a personal experience... as any issue, weight issue has to do, not with laziness (that argument is kinda lazy itself) or bad  personality (I can't believe people think that), but with some inner pain. obesity is, for many people, a coping mechanism, a defense mechanism. overeating fulfills their voids temporarily, helps them calm themselves, for some people it's a shield that protects them from unwanted attention (many fat women had traumatic sexual experiences),etc. of course it's an unhealthy mechanism. but psyche is a complex system. fat shaming doesn't help. hating yourself doesn't help. it only makes you more destructive. unhappy people overeat. happy people who feel good about themselves don't overeat. and milo, katie and the rest of their group are bullies and there is nothing noble in what they're doing. it's stupid to glorify obesity, to say it's beautiful and stuff, yes. but to disrespect people because they have a problem that manifests in a visible way is a sign of a low life. those people who disrespect fat people and don't see them as human and have the need to say nasty things, instead of offering help (if you don't know how to help or don't want to then stay away) are very insecure people who tend to hate themselves. both milo and katie and some others have the need to convince us they are fabulous and put others down and we all know narcissism isn't self love.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Difficult subject for me. I definitely agree that shaming and bullying are wrong. I also agree that it's important to provide role models that empower kids to be whoever they want to be, and live their lives free of stigma and shame. But this is where things get difficult for me: Where is the line between body-positivity + encouraging freedom of choice, and promoting unhealthy choices? I mean, there's a reason why nobody is calling for role-models advocating anorexia, smoking, alcoholism, drug abuse etc. Apart from this issue, the other problem I have is not wanting to shame or bully people + wanting to respect their freedom of choice vs. standing by watching someone eat or smoke or drink themselves into mental or physical ill-being. In such situations, I see no way to bring up my concerns without making that person feel ashamed or offended to some degree, even if that is not my intent. When I don't say anything, I carry around a feeling of guilt and regret for not speaking up. So idk, it's kind of a lose lose situation here, and my moral compass is spinning, no resolve in sight.  Anyways, I wanted to say thanks for your brilliant content and the work you put into debating contrapoints. Discovered your channel 2 days ago and been binging your vids since.

"I love all your videos but I kinda disagree with this one. I grew up as a fat kid my highest weight was 300 and I currently weigh 250 so I'm still a fat fuck but I gotta say as much as fat shaming hurts it really has motivated me to exercise and watch what I eat going as far as cutting out pop(excluding when I drink alcohol) I've felt a lot better and my mental health has improved quite a bit since I started trying to change my life and I understand it's a lot easier losing weight as a 22 year old male then say a 45 year old woman  though I have noticed a lot of over weight people really do sit around more and do eat a larger portion of high calorie food which leads to a cycle where they want to do it more (Myself included). Though I definitely agree that people should definitely not feel ashamed of what they look like though that complacency leads a lot of people to not want to change their lifestyle which I think is sad because the long term effects of obesity is a prolonged painful death. I've known people with diabetes who have lost legs and people in their early 50's who just one day died of heart attacks out of the blue and the effects on the people around them is just tragic.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The thing about obesity is that a lot of morbidly obese patients have an unhealthy relationship with food. Watch 'My 600 lb Life' and you'll find that almost all of them used food to make themselves feel better (the real tragic ones because of sexual violence from their childhood) and fat shaming only drives them to eat *more* food. Too recover from morbid obesity one has to do more than stop eating--they have to learn how to find happiness away from food and how to accept themselves. Tell them that they're a 'fatty' and a 'drain on society' only serves to make the whole thing worse.  tl;dr: food can be an addiction and therapy (not bullying) is the answer.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I like your channel but here's the thing: Humans are meant to exercise and eat. That's how we survived. Obesity and fatness is linked to cancer, heart disease, and etc. I used to be 300 lbs at  5'3 and I lost 180 lbs because I had heart problems, I was taking blood pressure medicine at 14 when most people who take it are in there sixties, and if I were to keep down that road by time I were to 35 i would've been dead. Yes I have hypothyroid and PCOS, but I was eating 12,000 calories a day, where I should've been eating only 2,000 Here's the thing: Eating too much= bad Eating too little= Bad  Obesity is mostly just a choice. And I'm sorry but I'm just going to have to state this: My uncle is a mortician and every fat person he prepared about 80% of them were below age of 50, the most common age being an average of 39, the youngest was 11 years old and she was a mere 250 lbs and died from a heart attack.

"So first off I am not trying to tell anyone what to do but if you do want to lose weight this is good advice. There are a lot of false solutions out there. Everyone likes to focus on dieting and cardio but these don't really help because the weight will come right back after you stop. What does work is weight training and cutting sugar. Cutting soda and alcohol(if you prefer to drink alcohol then you will probably have to cut grains) out of your diet and doing 3 10 minute kettlebell routines a week is all most people really need to do. You want to do exercises that build muscle to increase your resting metabolism so you can lose weight with minimal dietary changes. Drinking black coffee(has to be black. Milk slows down the caffeine intake diminishing the hunger reducing effect and sugar is counter productive. You will get used to the taste pretty quickly. buy good medium or light roast coffee) instead of eating breakfast also helps because breakfast is actually a fairly recent addition for non rich people(as the photos above show, those rich people were pretty heavy). Anyways the real problem with obesity is it is very easy to get to a point where you cannot do things like kettlebell routines and I hate to say it but one persons poor health is a burden on everyones insurance premiums. It is a good idea for the sake of health to keep track of your weight and adjust behavior if you see it increasing. As stated in the video it is much easier to gain than to lose. Anyways these are the things I did when I started becoming overweight. I still eat whatever I want. I do allow myself to be hungry from time to time. I also cook my own meals. Standing in front of a stove burns a bit of calories too plus I can control how much fat and sugar is in my meal. That said I use tons of butter.  A lot of people like putting off these changes but what it really comes down to is do you want to be, insert characteristic or addiction here, the rest of your life. If the answer is no there is no better time to start than today. This goes for addictions as well which also tend to be shamed. Basically do what you want but if you see something that you have control over, addiction, weight, ect., as a problem, do not put off taking action because it will only get harder as you get older.  Anyways again not trying to shame or tell people how to live their life. Just sharing what worked for me to those who do want to lose weight.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Time is a large factor, too. In order to make meals that are satisfying food groups you need to set aside at least four hours a week (again, which a lot of working people do not have time for).

"While fat-shaming is bullshit, there is something to be said for having concern for the potential effect the obesity epidemic has on the healthcare system, particularly in a place like Canada (where I live) that has a public healthcare system that's already under strain from our rapidly aging population. While I don't think it's okay to fat-shame somebody, I do feel it's important to discuss the implications of the potential strain obesity has on our publicly funded healthcare system, and how this may affect availability of service. The government has stepped in and tried to curb smoking because of the obvious health risks assumed by smokers, and it's my opinion that similar measures should be taken regarding the obesity epidemic our country faces, maybe it would be for the best to make half the pack of doritos a picture of somebody getting cut out of their house by the fire department.

"Summary: This comment is a combo of ass-kissing agreement with one possible disagreement/critique about celebrating fatness. Yes my YouTube comments are too long.  Not good at this format.  Too lazy to change.    I absolutely love your channel.  I agree with you more than 90% of the time mostly because you don't get caught up in the fallacies that derail too many people - namely reductionism, dichotomization and ignoring context. Those kinds of biases/fallacies often lead to absurd and extreme ideological positions from fascism to less dangerous but annoying and counterproductive out-of-touch self-righteous absurdist identity politics (as opposed to valid reasonable ID politics).    But at the end were you suggesting we celebrate fatness and obesity?   I appreciate you being conscious of conflating overweight with morbid obesity.  However, the science is overwhelming clear that overweight is also unhealthy. I also appreciate not conflating health with morality and being pragmatic in noting shame doesn't work so well (even if someone thought it morally ok).   But it seems like a kind of dichotomization or contrarianism to suggest that if shaming is bad (I agree) that celebration and encouragement of ill-health (albeit just one scientifically confirmed aspect of ill-health) is good.    On the other hand, you could argue that celebration of fatness could undo the harm of shame.  But that is also dichotomization.   We can certainly find a middle ground can we not?     I say all this as someone who used to be in public health, recognizing that health should not be conflated with morality and also being able to keep health in perspective (eg we don't need to do everything perfectly from a health standpoint). But overweight/obesity and its consequences are pretty staggering and mind blowing at individual and societal levels.    Like I said, I rarely find the opportunity to disagree (because you are awesome) and you do invite comments of disagreement.  Ok let's face it, I'm writing this for me more than you. I was a philosophy major (with grad degrees in social work and public health) and love to discuss, debate etc. I realize I am probably amplifying your suggestion(?) of fat celebration for this purpose.

"I've been watching a lot of your videos and I agree much more than I expected on various things, in some other things I disagree. But in this one there is something that really ticks me off. You say it's none of your business to tell other people they should be healthy and you don't think its virtuous to be healthy, but a sick person can't be a functioning member of society. Obesity is a huge burden on healthcare systems because it comes with a plethora of other life-threatening, long lasting diseases like hypertension, diabetes and heart disease. If the United States ever wants to dream about universal healthcare then you can't have the attitude of 'I'm not going to say anything about other people's unhealthy habits, its none of my business'. Some of the fundamental pillars of public health are education and community involvement. While telling an obese person 'stop eating you're unhealthy' isn't going to do shit, saying 'lets just accept diverse body types' will not bring any real solution to the problem and in fact, its going to make it worse.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think you have put it brilliantly. While I agree with most of the points you have mentioned, there is one point that I don't think you have effectively talked about. Being skinny does not necessarily mean one has good health. There are a lot of things that can be wrong with one's health even if they are skinny, and some of those things might actually have caused the person to be skinny. But being obese almost always comes with health risks. You say it's not necessarily a virtue to have good health, and I agree with that. But I would rarely shy away from telling a friend or family that they would benefit from losing a few pounds if it seems so.  Because obesity is linked to appearance, and given the body-shape standards the media has promoted, it is a sensitive issue. And the more sensitive an issue is, the more bullies we see exploiting it. I don't think the solution is to stop talking about it, but to have more informed and sympathetic conversations. Also the focus needs to move away from appearance to health. Bullies like Milo use the 'health' card to really go after one's appearance.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Hearing this video, especially from somebody who isn't a similar size to me, is so reassuring, just to know other people do actually agree it IS blatant bullying and it CERTAINLY doesn't help in any way, shape or form, and that facts do back this shit up. I lost a looooot of weight in my teens, developed an eating disorder and got real depressed and weh, life sucked and it was self-loathing central. Put all the weight back on and probably more, but I don't 100% hate myself anymore because maybe I can be FAT and still have ~self worth~ and be a good person etc, what a wild realisation! I'm actually kinda happy, wtf!  ANYWAY, you are fabulous and I totally love you for as much as I can love a complete stranger, I need you in my life to just have these conversations with because you're eloquent and smart and all the things I'm not.

"Not connected to this topic, but I was so happy and gratified recently to see the self-inflicted downfall of professional troll Katie Hopkins! (Depicted on your video at 35 seconds in). She brought a disasterous defamational/libel suit against a restaurant owner and lost big time! Even lost her house! The lady she sued wished her no ill-will, and was even prepared to settle for an apology. However, the 'troll was not for turning' and just like another hardline right-wing conversative blonde woman who did a lot of harm to her country, she was eventually hoist by her own petard.

"I was born into a family where everyone had binge eating disorder so inevitably I too grew up with binge eating disorder without even realizing it was a disorder or even remotely unhealthy cause thats all I was familiar with. my parents also both suffer from major depressive disorder and dystimia, both of which I inherited, leaving my energy levels very, very shitty. I liked sports until I started getting noticeably chubbier than the other kids in my grade and no one would let me play sports with them and everyone beat the shit out of in dodge ball in gym, and would trip me when I was running laps, so uhhhhhhh long story short I learned to resent sports and got even fatter. Then in middle school I started getting body positive, and almost recovered, until high school came along where I met a girl who taught me how to purge and restrict. I then developed anorexia nervosa, and then I realized i was still sick and dying probably even worse that before, so I tried to recover from that DIY style (I do not recommend DIY eating disorder recovery btw) but I ended up just trading in anorexia for bulimia, and then I got to my highest weight ever and decided fuck it I'd rather be unhealthy and skinny than unhealthy and fat so that at least society would accept me. and then I deadass fasted for 3 weeks straight and lost 40 pounds in 2 months and everyone gave me a lot of attention for this and I thrived off of that. anyways, here I am now, literally fucking dying of EDNOS (eating disorder not otherwise specified) and all of this probably could have been prevented had those kids in elementary school just let me play fucking soccer with them. No one can fucking tell me fat shaming works. I'm at the most unhealthy point of my life right now, and I'm also at my lowest weight ever. fat shaming kills.

"Also, yes, when health care is public, like in Canada, I have a right to be angry that obese people cost more money than people within a healthy BMI range.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"The general population does not know how to be within a respectable BMI. All you need to do, really, is to: consume no sugar, avoid artificial sweeteners, workout for about 30 minutes daily, don't down two pints of beer after every work shift and practice meditation (in whatever form that suits you).   Unlike what many think, calories in and calories out is a big meme, partially. It is not just a matter of how much you eat, it is also how this food is used by the body. Now you may cry 'that's genetics!!!!' and while this is partly true, you have more control over this than the DNA strands inside your puny cells. There is a fantastic hormone known as insulin. This beauty, in part, regulates you sugar levels in the blood but also how food is utilized by your body. Without getting into too many details, if you can decrease your insulin resistance, you can also ensure that your body does not convert too much of the calories consumed into reserve for later. Commonly called fat. So how does this insulin resistance increase or decrease? Simple, insulin is a reaction to what you eat and if you stop eating the foods that increase it very highly (the ones mentioned above) or, what leads me to my next great tool against obesity, fasting.   Fasting will not kill you. You are not meant to eat 3 meals a day, that is a complete scam by the food industry. You can survive for extremely long on just water and a few minerals such as salt and potassium. An obese man weighing 400lbs didn't eat for 280 days and he lived without ever going back above 200lbs. I did not eat for two weeks during my final week of exams and did just fine. Fasting is even used to treat type 2 diabetes. Now that this myth is out of the way: why fasting? Fasting means that you don't eat anything except water and a few gellules with your salt and potassium in it. If you don't eat anything then your body will have to search for food and unlike what you think, it won't eat your muscles. Picture a caveman; he is hungry. Food has run out two days ago and he needs to find a source of food. Luckily, his body isn't completely dense and actually used the storage of energy (fat) that it has. Caveman finds a source of food the day after. He lost 3 lbs but three pounds of fat, not muscle. That would be stupid. Muscles take more energy to produce than fat and have significantly less energy. So although this is a fictional story about a caveman, this is still a mechanism that other animals, including humans, have. Camels store fat on their back to be used when food is scarce. Now, you don't eat calories, you lose fat. Simple but there's even more to it. Your insulin resistance decreases and your addiction to sugar is better. Oh by the way, you don't feel hungry when you fast for a few days.  Finally, sugar. Sugar is a highly addictive drug that is being put into your food everyday from dusk to dawn. Fat was initially scapegoated as the cause for obesity when in actuality it is sugar. If sugar is a drug then why is it allowed? Multi-billion industry is my answer for you. It makes people addicted and paired with the fact that eating feels almost half as good as an orgasm for the brain, it is quite easy to understand why people are paid to shut up about the issue. This is not the case so much today but my brother still insists that fat makes you fat and so this leads me to believe that others may think this as well. I previously mentioned 'your sugar addiction is better' and by this I mean that you will not have intense cravings for sugar as you did prior to a fast. Of course, this is not going to last forever as you can get hooked on sugar again but it is an easy fix.   I will conclude this monstrous blog post here and if you actually managed to read through my unedited shitpost and want to learn more, the key words are: water fasting, jason fung and why sugar is bad.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I agree with you in other videos but in this one I don't.  It's obvious that we shouldn't be shaming people for being fat. Obviously.  However, we shouldn't do the opposite by saying that all types of bodies are ok. Yes, there are bodies that are extremely unhealthy.  We can't order people to be healthy. Obviously. However, normalizing certain types of bodies, saying these are ok, will harm people, just like when in magazines they would show anorexic women in their covers. That damages the self-image and self-esteem of people. They will try to obtain these bodies and in the process they will harm themselves.

"I use to be mildly obese (Was almost 260), and now being about 100 lbs lighter 4 years later, I still feel awful but somehow better at the same time. I physically feel more energized, 'lighter', and my cooking has gotten better which is a plus! But I still suffer mental problems from being fat-shamed by so many people (My parents, ex-friends, exes, some randoms throughout high school, etc.). I feel as though of wanting to binge my feelings (I use to suffer terrible binging when I was fatter) to judging my body after every time I eat A SLICE of pizza or eat A LITTLE junk food as once and a while treat. Don't even get me started about my fear for eating too much bread. It's really hard to go through sometimes.   Anyways, no fatshaming doesn't work.

Because science does say that it is dangerous to be vastly overweight, and can lead to a lot of health problems, which in the UK means being a strain of the NHS. I honestly think the best solution would be to restrict the companies making billions feeding junk to people and offering real help to those who are vastly overweight, almost like rehab programs that don't focus on shame but on self improvement. Let's face it, a lot of morbidly obese people have very debilitating lives with some not even being able to walk and I would want people to suffer the least and have the highest quality of life possible.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Yeah, I've been 270 and 115 lbs, and many places in between. It's amazing even the difference in 'neutral' treatment you receive when on one end of the other. I can attest to the fact that, nope, people are just fearful assholes. And that people are afraid of 'disability', thus explaining at least some of the source of the mocking and/or complete avoidance. It distances them from a potential reality that really any of us could and probably will have. (Maybe a future video topic, though? Would love your view on the healthcare system, our avoidance to sickness - and therefore 'uselessness' in our particular economy - and how that might translate into our general apathy as a country to actually, I don't know...get our shit together?)  FYI, to those wondering, I had weight loss surgery after a thyroid condition took me from chunky to full-on obese, in just 7 months. A doctor laughed at me, and so a diagnosis was put off further. I've been able to keep it off for a long time now, but I am not the norm. I can attest that even when restriction is helped along, weight loss is not easy or a guarantee, especially massive weight loss. Many do and will fail.

"The whole 'tough love' falls apart when you know that a lot of disordered eating stems from traumatic events.  For example, a large number of women develop binge eating disorders after being raped.  An anecdote:   A member of my eating disorder support group started binge eating as a teenager after being raped.  She wanted to put on weight because she didn't trust men that hit on her.  She grew up, met a man that loved her for who she is, had children who she adores and comfortably lost some weight.  That took ~20 years.  Now in her 40s living a comfortable life, she gets raped again.  The sense of control from exercise and fasting became her addiction as a coping mechanism.  She now suffers from anorexia nervosa.  Her life is in danger, she knows it, she knows what she can do but it is incredibly hard.  So hard that she instinctively rather risk dying and be hospitalized than have as much as late and NOT go to the gym for 3 hours a day.  The last thing she needs, as she's learning how to cope healthily with her trauma, is to be shamed in the media and by health professionals (yes, the later has happened).

"If one eats a healthy (not crazy neurotic healthy but general health) and exercises regularly then I'm cool with them being fat. Some people look good fat and they're fun to hug. Fat is an important part of our body (brain, joints, organs, warmth, etc).   My main reasoning behind being healthy is for proper neurotransmitter production and secretion. Along with the psyche that freedom of health brings (can do most any physical thing one wants).   As far as the lingering anxiety, we want to be thin and attractive so we can attract sexual partners as well as obtain the power that comes along with desire. These are instinctual cues from 'Darwinian theory' and also signifiers that we managed to overcome a common hardship in life (healthy in modern times).   When it comes to fat shaming, compassion is needed. Most overweight people are uneducated or have mental health issues (being as small as a lack of self-efficacy or/and discipline). Shaming them is one method but it is far less effective then authentically and compassionately delivering the truth.  I don't recommend we pretend that being obese is fine or that we make fat sexy. Going about acceptance and promoting healthy change in a compassionate and loving manner is a much more effective route though.

I didn't believen in the vague 'its unhealthy' premise until I actually learned what garbage shitty food does to your body. I dont see how having fat role models and promoting body positivity will help at all. If anything its counterproductive, the reason you value the so called 'vanity' of skinny fit bodies is because we are (for the most part) biological programmed to. We associate health with attractiveness in order to find proper partners to reproduce with and almost in every axample being the healthiest you can be happens to coincide with being the most attractive you can be. This is not to promote wanting to be as beautiful as a superstar of unatainable beauty, but just the healthiest and thus most attractive version of yourself.

Also due to ignorance about simple and easy to learn things about nutrition available online.  And of course there are millions of people with inherent conditions making them put on weight, that they can't help it.  The problem is a lot of people that hate their fat bodies and use 'fat acceptance/love' to disguise whatever issues they're avoiding coming to terms with and hide behind just loving yourself, it will keep leaking into the rest of their lives and perpetuate their misery lol because they're just using coping tricks insteas of dealing with the main cause yo.  I'm pretty blazed right now so i might have forgotten to write something but the bottom line is that a large number of people are fat because of their problematic lifestyle choices and worldview and often they use ACTUALLY HELPLESS PEOPLE WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS as scapegoats and try to hide behind it, and it hurts them the most, also a lot of money gets spent into helping people with Preventable illnesses, money that could go into helping people who are in bad situations due to No Fault of their own. I don't blame them for it, humans are born super faulty  and sometimes super duper faulty by no fault of their own, and due to being born into different lives and places it all just gets even more complicated, so one can't expcet everyone to sort their problems out. 2diffrent.

"Finally something a vid from you I can actually dissagree with. You know how disturbing it gets when you agree with everything a person you like says? It makes you question your own ability to think. Anyway. Yeah fat shaming is bad. Ostrosizing people from society isn't going to help them lead a more healthy lifestyle. But there's a difference between shaming and non acceptance. Obesiety is an objective health risk, and it's an objective empidemic, the last thing you want to do is normalize it. I'd be all for obese role models, but if they aren't role models who are working on getting better, then they're no different from role models who are drinking and smoking. That is, not even bad necessarily, but not suitable for children.   And not pursuing health is a moral cost. It's not valuing your own life enough. It can be a moral cost to pay to live the lifestyle you want to live, and that's your choice to make. So if being healthy makes you missearble, then being unhealthy might be worth it. Not for me to say.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"shaming people for being fat is dumb as that is never the right way to go about convincing anyone to do anything. Still, exercise is important for many of these people to keep the weight off, not just diet. Lots of people (thinner or fater) don't treat exercise as,a lifestyle, thats,why they will never keep it up. Being healthy is a a virtue because many diseases and conditions occur along with obesity (earlier onset arthritis for example). People having preventable conditions cost alot in lost in labor, aside from the fact that you're hurting yourself. I know that matters more in a capatalist society but still, that's like people who still smoke and don't quit and of course the chronic alcoholic. I know it can be kind of hard, but it's still pretty annoying that you don't despite all the negative affects it can have on your health. And yes, I will bitch about it for these reasons. I also don't appreciate people making it look like genetic causes of obesity are common place. They are not. Yes, our shitty high fructose corn syrup ladden processed foods are just as much to blame, but at the end of the day, even when people have a slower metabolisms or not, being fat is an indicator of unhealthiness, though not required to be unhealthy (slimmer people can be/ eat unhealthy and it's still bad). It is just more obvious is all. Eitherway, it is a signal that you're not being healthy.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

There is no reason why we can't, as a society, hold the view that obesity is bad and people who are obese should work to resolve that issue if they are able, while also not being pointlessly cruel to them. You seem reasonable and I want to agree with you on more but the idea that we should treat obesity as a positive thing could seriously harm the quality of life of many people if it became a popular idea.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Maybe some people really are. But that's still no reason to go out of your way to pretend to 'care' for someone's health. Being overweight really does not feel good. Not in a 'body image' and 'self esteem' perspective, but from the actual ORGAN and GUT feeling. Who enjoys feeling bloated and cold? Who enjoys having little stamina? And while no one should grab these 'arguments' right out of the context and go 'hahah, see? People agree with my stupid excuse for bullying innocent people', I cannot exactly say that I 'promote' the (at least in my eyes) 'glorification' of being at a weight limit by PERSONAL CHOICE that will impact your cardiovascular health and your well-being overall. Most of the people who are being told, or hell, are even telling themselves, that they're 'fat' are actually so slight over the apparently norm-accepted weight that a little exercise of choice will do the trick. I will not be able to tell if they'll be happier after, but again; It's a choice thing. But bullying will lead to mental health problems which can last up to a lifetime.

Let's be honest morbid obesity is correlated with a lot of health issues, and it amplifies some genetic predispositions aswell. I think it is definitely better if most of society is not obese, as you don't want a big chunk of your population to be prone to illness, demanding taxpayer money for treatment. So with such a high obesity rate in the US, you're looking a quite a problem. But fat shaming and and cruel bullying is definitely not the solution.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I get totally that it is not just a matter of lazy people refusing to change bad diets or reduce intake.

Sure, damaging your self esteem over your weight isn't okay, but making it normal and okay also isn't okay imo. Let's not forget most leading causes of death are due to obesity. 75% of America is obese (according to some sources). Just because shaming people over it makes things worse, doesn't mean promoting it in media or not holding people accountable is much better.

"I agree that Milo et al. are simply hating people that are already hurting, that it makes matters worse. I think the perfect response to this is Boogie2988's response to 'Dear Fat People'. Clearly the most useful way to adress the issue is, like you did, cite studies, causes and solutions, without animosity. I REALLY disagree that part of the solution is displaying obesity and morbid obesity as just another type of body. It isn't. It's the other extreme of paper thin runway models, how is that healthy? Lindy West, who you cite here, is not 'fat' or 'obese' she's destroying her joints and clogging her heart. But she wants to see more people like her?  I agree with representing different types of bodies, I don't agree with our representations saying that someone that needs an electric wheelchair because he/she is so fat is normal. Obesity can't represent excess, wealth or 'bon vivants' anymore. Really fat people can be poor and malnourished too, because there's so much cheap shit to eat now.   'Fat Acceptance' is a movement (i'd say a delusion) that wants to normalize severe morbid obesity, that denies any and all medical information on obesity and its consequences, and glorifies as beautiful increasingly fatter and fatter people -people who can't even move properly- to the point of demanding that they are deemed attractive. Is Contra for that? This video should be called 'Fat Shaming'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I have no ill will towards fat people, but its not fair that a healthy person in need of cancer treatment might get it too late because the budget and doctors were too busy resuscitating a 30 stone someone who fell over and had a stroke from the strain of getting back up.

"I completely agree with the points you brought up against clowns like Milo. They really do seem to just want to bully people, and concerns about health are just their way of trying to justify their behavior. In the end, their methods are counterproductive at best and outright destructive at worst.  Though, I disagree with the notion that society should 'give up' on trying to combat the obesity problem. It's a very complex issue and will be difficult to solve, but just because something is hard doesn't mean it's not worth trying to fix. You mention that 'someone else being fat doesn't effect me,' but especially if the given society wants something like universal healthcare, it does. In the long-term, it means more money spent on fixing the health problems an obese population is more prone to getting.  Even in the more abstract, the issues that lead to my neighbor being fat can lead to me being fat, be it lack of healthy food available, lack of education on nutrition, increased stress in the jobs available, etc. Being obese is not healthy and has many causes, and also societal effects.We shouldn't 'just move on' from a public health crisis. I also see some people pointing out 'Well, in the past, being fat was actually an attractive thing.' I find that to be such a silly point to make. People in the past didn't know any better, there was a period of time where doctors thought it was fine to deliver babies without washing their hands first. There were also times where royal families thought inbreeding was healthy because it 'kept the blood pure.' Why does it matter so much what some Roman society thought was attractive? We know now that obesity has long-term negative health effects.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I think something else to understand is that 'being fat' and 'being healthy' arent ALWAYS mutually exclusive concepts? Fat is just fat. Everyone has some fat on them, and some people have more or less fat on them than others. They're cells that hold onto extra energy that the body currently isn't using, something that used to help us survive throughout prehistory. That's it. Not to mention that, what a shocker, it's possible to have health problems from being too skinny too.   Can too much fat cause health problems? Yes. But having too little fat can do the same, and more often than not the 'social' standard for skinniness can have just as many health issues attached to them as fat people.   So maybe what we should do is frame the discussion less as 'how to loose weight to become skinny' and instead discuss it as 'what role does fat play in the overall complexity of the spectrum of human health and what can we do to improve it, regardless of body type.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I believe the lack of fat female role models, historically in Western art, may be due to the influence of weight on fertility.  While Rubenesque may be ideal, allowing reproduction in times of famine, PCOS pretty much makes you infertile.  Until the early modern period, under Patriarchal systems women are viewed as machines for producing sons.  21st century norms are a bit different, focusing on extremes of slenderness, because the time and money required to remain thin in an obesogenic environment are a sign of opulence.  I speak as a grad in history with ONE art history course, mostly focusing on Asian history, and a 100+ pound weight loss, but still a BMI of about 34, so I may be absolutely wrong, and if so I'm both sorry about open to correction.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"the biggest problem i see with the 'it's for your health! don't promote fatness! it's unhealthy!' is that it's... not about health. not in the slightest. (also im gonna apologize beforehand for the fucking novel im about to type up down here, sorry) 1. is talking about fat people in a non-shaming way really promoting fatness? if so, that MUST mean showing a character on TV with a wheelchair in a positive light is promoting conditions that cause leg paralysis, right? there's a character with tuberculosis, which must mean that strange talking box is telling us all to go get tuberculosis! it's ridiculous. it's just a way to sugar-coat the fact that they don't want to even LOOK at an entire group of people. 2. even if #1 is false, there really... isn't a way to promote fatness like everyone is claiming. a LOT of people that end up obese usually end up that way no matter what their diet or lifestyle looks like, because when someone is predisposed to it their body will find a way to gain the weight and keep it on. take it from someone who's 5'5 and 170 lbs despite all the 800-calorie diets, the after-every-meal-purging, the flat tummy teas, the flat out fasting, and the obsession with putting my heart rate near 200 on the treadmill. this has been going on for years, and if being fat was a choice, i sure as hell wouldn't still be a size 12 given how i live. 3. there's some sort of deep-seated anxiety in the center of that statement, like what Contra touched on in the last portion of her video. I think people fear that if fatness is shown in ANY non-negative light, they're going to let go of their inhibitions over their bodies and all the time they likely spent beating themselves up over their bodies will have been for naught. if they learn to accept fatness, they fear they will become it. i get it - i was the same way for a while (while... still being fat myself, go figure).

"While I absolutely agree with that it's indefensible for anyone to moralize over weight, I do think that healthcare professionals should always guide people towards healthy living; it's their job, and in the long run I believe it leads to less sickness and death. I'm not sure where you stand here though, since around 7:50 you first say something similar, then turn away from it? Also I don't think that kind of professional dietary advice is necessarily moralizing, but it sure can be interpreted that way.  I'd be very interested to hear your thoughts on the fat acceptance 'movement' or whatever one should call it. I'm all for being ok with however people look, but some people advocating this in their ignorance go so far as to make claims about the health of very overweight people, saying that they are totally healthy and whatnot. While this could certainly be true if verified by medicine, in general it is not, and because of the memetic nature of the spread of these sentiments, I can potentially see it being actively harmful for those who take such claims at face value.  Seperating healthiness from morals seems to be the biggest issue, but, logically speaking, there is no reason why they necessarily must be linked.

"I don't know how much stock you put in personal anecdotes or how much truth you expect some random fuck on the internet to speak, but I feel the need to share and persuade anyway. A few years ago, I decided to actually get control of my life and my body, and so I began my journey of being healthy. In about a year's time went from 270lbs to 175, my squat went from an empty barbell to 250lbs. A lot of that was fueled by shame, anger, and a multitude of feelings I kept repressed for my entire life. But even with that, the crux of the whole thing was a desire to get better, and the discovery that the way of doing so is simple. You can't surrender yourself to the way things are. Despair is comforting, and it seems a lot easier to let yourself rot and endure your self-pity than it is to change your habits. I'm getting too poetic for a youtube comment. The point I'm trying to get to is that obesity, a disease, should not be celebrated. It can be cured and should be, it's empowering and liberating for the person suffering from it to be rid of it. The simple act of being fat is miserable and exhausting (I speak of the mere physicality of it, not the social stigma and the self worth issues that stem from that, body image and the development of dismorphia are a different can of worms). And I am certainly not advocating for the shaming of people suffering from the disease, they have enough personal demons screaming at them to make themselves miserable. The last thing they need are real monsters reinforcing those voices. I'm advocating for the education of health; that people should know how their bodies work, what to do with their bodies to keep it working well, and that keeping yourself from developing too much fat can take up as much of your daily routine as taking a daily bath (barring medical extremities).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"If you really want to help people, talk about insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome instead of critiquing your mortal enemies. Otherwise this comes across as facetious. You simultaneously agree that the conditions that whatever causes: various and assorted food industries, stressors, income, what have you are causing super morbid obesity in the masses. But at the  same time you're talking about people have to accept those stressors and factors as some kind of fatalistic fact that can never be changed. No, no they do not have to be accepted as one's 'lot' and yes, yes they can most definitely be reversed.     I'm saying this as a former fat person who still is according to statistics slightly overweight and still has a little bit left to lose but it's a hell of a lot better now than when I was obese. I was prediabetic, and my health was at the worst it's ever been.   *And* I had no idea why my clothes were suddenly getting tighter even though I was eating on average one Pepperidge Farm coconut cake a week. I had a lot of stress going on in my life , a relative was dying of cancer,  I had been in not one but two abusive relationships concurrently: there was a lot of stuff.    So imagine my shock and horror when I go to a new doctor who very seriously tells me that I am obese. You could've knocked me over with a feather.   When I was told this, do you think I ran back to the coconut cake? Not on your life. I took it as seriously as the inevitable  heart attack and/or Hypertension I was no doubt looking forward to if I kept doing what I was doing. I reversed it through learning about nutrition, learning about what a calorie is, learning about obesity related disorders and how to reverse them. Learning about inflammation: learning about insulin resistance,  Learning about the fact that I was sensitive to gluten and grains and basically had to say goodbye to them permanently,  Learning about the ketogenic diet, learning learning learning about everything I could as if my life depended on it. And guess what? It did!   I reversed the pre-diabetes state I was in and I saved my health because I had to save my life. It was that important.   And I have a serious thyroid disease! You know, the excuse always used to make weight loss hard for people?  I didn't even work out. I just changed the way I viewed food. I educated myself on what foods worked for my body and I used it to its fullest advantage. I researched the heck out of the subject.    Some people need to be scared straight. I'm not suggesting fat shaming of course,  but we don't need to accept fat, either.  I don't need to embrace it as this 'cultural phenomenon'. It's a *health condition* and it's a *health epidemic* and it's a danger to that person's life! It is very serious. It's not a joke!   At end of the day most morbidly obese people do not understand what a carbohydrate is , what a protein is , and what healthy and unhealthy fats are and how they interact with their unique biology. Believe it or not it's not about portion control. It's not about counting calories. It's about understanding how carbohydrates fats and proteins interact with your body. And also understanding that basically refined sugars and preservatives and chemicals that are artificially injected in/sprayed on food also play a role.  Some people are more insulin resistant than others.  Some people are more prone to body inflammation than others. It could be argued that it is a number of those factors you mentioned.  If there's an obese or morbidly obese person who after researching all of the stuff and cognitively understands it still does what they're doing without activating some kind of pro health program for themselves, then they need a psychologist they don't need a nutritionist. There's something mentally wrong with that person's worldview if they choose to remain obese. As you stated no obese person would actually choose to be obese unless there was some kind of trauma or  early childhood trauma defense mechanism in place that went unresolved in which case I have nothing but compassion for that person not ridicule and I wish them wellness and I hope they heal their childhood wounds.     But  if we're being really honest , also show me a super morbidly obese person who hasn't done anything to improve their situation who knows exactly what any of those  terms are. At the end of the day it boils down to super morbid ( in some cases willful) ignorance.  And ignorance should not be accepted.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"TW: eating disorders including side effects, suicide.    I really like your show but I find it really unfortunate that you included a 'joke' about bulimia in this video. Eating disorders including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and OSFED are deadly and destroy lives. Binging and purging through vomiting can inculde the lovely side effects of stomach or esophagus rupture, low electrolytes with heart attack and/or tooth decay/loss. You can read about some of these here URL (warning for graphic pictures) This is in addition to the mental torture of self hatred, anxiety, exhaustion, guilt, shame, suicidal ideation etc that comes with an eating disorder. The inclusion in a video addressing the anxiety around the pressure to be thin which is a component of eating disorders is not very respectful and disregards the seriousness of mental illnesses. Anorexia nervosa has the highest death rate when compared to other mental illnesses with bulimia and other eating disorders having increased mortality not just form the physical effects but the high rate of suicide. One of the barriers to weight loss includes emotional eating and on the extreme end of the binge eating disorder which brings about the same pain as with other eating disorders. If you could cut out the joke in this video that would be really good as eating disorders are no joke.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Let's not strawman the people who argue against so-called 'body positivity', i.e. the social acceptance of obesity. Not all of them are vitriolic, moralistic assholes who would like nothing better than to make fat people's lives miserable. In fact, I know several of them who genuinely care about their fellow humans, and who do not want to live in a society where the fear of offending or stigmatizing can lead to people being unhealthy. These people genuinely view overly permissive social norms around weight as a failure of compassion, and they have a point.   The body positivity crowd also has some good points: fat shaming can be stigmatizing, and it encourages some people to harass obese people - this is definitely detrimental to the person's mental health, it might lead to eating disorders and self-hatred, it might lead people to want to give up altogether on living a healthy lifestyle. And even if shaming worked, if the end result was that overall there are less health issues in society (physical and mental) as a result of shaming, we might still not want to live in a society where some people are made worse off to make a larger number of people better off. It could also be seen as an overly paternalistic society. I'm less sympathetic to other reasons to oppose fat shaming, like the sort of cultural relativism that makes people dogmatically venerate tolerance above all other values (while tolerance is important, it is not the only value, nor the most important, in my opinion).   However, paternalism is not always a bad thing. We know for a fact that obesity is not healthy, and if 35% of people are now obese (compared to less than half of that 50 years ago), then we have a public health crisis on our hands, we don't simply accept this as the new normal of an 'acceptable' body weight - the facts of biology plus the fact that we care about people's well-being determine what is a body weight that we as a society should 'accept' as normal, not some arbitrary social fiat. We want to live in a society where people are as well-off as possible (which includes being healthy), but not overly paternalistic. Society should not enforce social norms in a way that leaves some (even many) people worse off than they otherwise would have been, but to say that we should adopt laissez-faire social norms that prevent anyone from being stigmatized but also lead to even more people being worse off - no, that's not the kind of society I want to live in, and I doubt it's the one you want to live in.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hmm, I found a place where I don't 100% agree with you.  While yes, obesity is far more complex than people like the asshole Milo make it out to be, there's a huge swath of people in-between Milo and Fat Acceptance types -- people like me who used to subscribe to some really defeatist ideas of weight loss who have struggled with weight their whole lives and watched their family do the same.  But to say that weight loss is more complex than 'calories in calories out' is just.. not true.  It IS that simple.  The reasons behind WHY it's difficult to follow that are VERY complex, but the act of weight loss itself is not.  I agree with everything you say about shame and how it isn't useful and is a terrible thing to do to people of course.  And society's relationship with weight and our aesthetic ideals as a whole are unhealthy (but I also worry we're going in the other direction with the HAES movement but that's another comment entirely).  But the above statement just kind of.. rubbed me the wrong way.  The laws of thermodynamics are constant and a calorie is nothing but a measure of energy.  The common misconceptions around that drive me mad.  I'm not sure if that's what you were trying to say or anything, truthfully I'm only halfway thru the video at the time of this comment.

"From my personal experience (nearly 5 years of a severe eating disorder), the only way to keep weight off in the long term is to develop some very detrimental habits around food and exercise. When you diet, your body intentionally lowers metabolism and raises appetite. In my case, it got so bad that I had to eat under 1,000 calories per day and exercise 60-90 minutes daily in order to maintain my 'healthy sized' body. I even gained weight on 1,200 calories.When I started eating normally again and went through recovery, I gained every single pound back within two months. I have a very healthy diet of mostly plant foods and enjoy biking, walking, and swimming regularly, but am now technically over weight. Some bodies are just genetically larger, and while diet and exercise does contribute to weight a little bit, it is in no way as important to weight as the media and society makes it out to be.

"When you were talking about the way that you feel about gaining weight and how it speaks on your vanity, not your actual concern for your health, that's exactly how I feel when I am on Tinder and I see someone mentioning the gym in their bio. Or they have the infamous gym pics posted. Or I'm hearing someone talk about how they need to hit the gym, (and sometimes there's even a level of shame thats associated with it when someone mentions that they missed a day of working out)  so on so forth. It never feels like these people actually care about being healthy. It always feels like they are buying into a perception, and they want brownie points. And the fact that they call this string of vanity 'taking care of yourself',  is narcissistic. If you're working out purely for the health of your well being, and not so people can notice your abs and your propped up derriere, good for you. I applaud you. But I feel like because of the way our culture tends to take things to such a vain extreme, very few people actually do care about their health. And reasons why I feel this way is because, these same people who spend 2 hours at the gym each day, refusing empty carbs and sugars,  also drink, do drugs, don't get a full 8 hours worth of sleep, and put themselves in to dangerous situations that can get them instantly killed, yet they are 'living a healthy lifestyle.' People rather be drug addicts, than fat. That's powerful. We as a society LIVE on such a distinct stream of thinking that is purely aligned with the physical and the material, that we rather KILL OURSELVES than to be visually displeasing ( and to borrow a phrase from our dear friends the MGTOW's, have a 'low sexual marketplace value.' Because you know, our entire lives revolve around how sexy a complete stranger thinks you are) That's.....wow, astounding. Being obese isn't good. But being skinny because you feel societal pressure TO be thin, isn't good either. They're both bad.

"I kinda agree with you. However, as a med student, I've spent the last years studying not only how fatness is unhealthy, but how it affects us in every way. The inside of our arteries, or brains, how it suffocates our organs. Two days ago I saw a fat man with diabetic foot and no insurance in the hospital i have classes on. His family couldn't afford the amputation and he had lost literally half his foot. I live in a third world country so no free healthcare or anything. Of course bullying is wrong, but fatness is a public health issue. That patient takes up a hospital bed that someone else needs, leaves a wife and child in debt for a surgery he couldn't afford and will likely end up a cripple needing treatment for the rest of his life. Maybe it IS the moral to choice to be healthy and we should be concerned with other people's health. The health ministry's already making plans to promote healthy eating in schools for example.

"While this is a good video on it's own, I don't understand your leap from 'no fat-shaming' to 'fat acceptance'. First you go on to say that obesity should be viewed as a social epidemic and cite studies to  support it: Mass obesity is to be seen as a result of free market capitalism, cultural norms, marketing, psychology and genetics. This implies that it is not natural, but rather forced upon us.  But then you do the exact opposite and characterize obesity as a conscious choice, that other individuals have no right to question. You also suggest that our standards of truth and beauty are culturally biased and should be questioned. That is true, in the context of individual obesity, but not in the context of epidemic obesity. Here you also fail to mention studies and instead appeal to individualism, disregarding the fact that obesity correlates with depression and unhappiness (which would lead one to believe, that our conscious choices are not always in our best interest).  So we have a deterministic, quasi socialist view of obesity as an inevitable evil under the system and an individualistic, post modern view of obesity as something, that's not inherently bad. The solution of 'fat acceptance' doesn't solve the problem of obesity, it just further justifies its existance in a capitalist society. But it can't solve it, because it can't prevent people from involuntarily becoming obese, nor does it help them escape obesity, if they chose to do so. It only helps a select few feel slightly better about themselves.   TL;DR: obesity can't both be the result of society and of individual choices. Fat acceptance just sweeps the problem under a rug (thereby helping the system perpetuate it)  Also, I feel like this inherent contradiction is what people mean, when they talk about post modern marxism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Fat-shaming is gross and wrong, but the counter-argument should not be 'open ourselves up to the celebration of the diversity of body types.' Obesity increases your risk of cancer, heart disease, heart attacks, autoimmune disorders, and basically all things humans should try to avoid to live healthy and long lives. Why should we celebrate this? We don't have to shame anyone but don't ask me to celebrate someone else's objectively unhealthy choices. Is there a genetic component to obesity? Sometimes, yes, but that doesn't account for a majority of cases unless somehow you want to argue that Americans have a genetic disposition to being obese, which obviously isn't true. Is there a genetic component to addiction? Yes, sometimes. Why shouldn't we 'celebrate the diversity of' self-harming drug habits? Some people are genetically predisposed to addiction, and those addictions sometimes manifest into food addictions, and sometimes into substance addictions. Should we celebrate all groups of people who make objectively unhealthy choices whether it's in regards to food, drugs, or general behavior? I can't really imagine a good argument to support that.

"I think the only legitimate point in any possible anti-fat position, is one I'm surprised you didn't touch on: societal burden.  Obesity and morbid obesity cause health problems and premature death (thus the morbid). Consequences (apart from death) include a broad range of things we all know, from heart attacks to cancer. Things that require treatment, that, in a socialised society, will be paid for by the larger community, in whole or in part, depending. I'm actually strongly in favour of socialism, so don't take that as a criticism of that. But not purely in an economical sense is this burden manifest. The time of doctors and the nurses, as well as the occupation of beds, are also factors. But it's a murky topic that, in my opinion, has no clear answer as of yet. Lots of things we do are dangerous to our health. Are we to condemn sport? Home improvement? Driving a car? Where do we draw the line? I don't know. We can't become ultra safe zombies, and not everyone can be thin (and it'd probably be boring if we were) but surely we have some duty to our fellow people to actively attempt to lessen the burden we each provide one another. Not beyond our capabilities (that's a pointlessly absurd request) but to our honest best. What does that look like? Again, I just don't know.

"This one struck a nerve. I've been overweight to some extent for my entire life. Morbidly so for most of my adolescence due to health issues and medications. Whenever I encounter trolls attacking fat people I try to remind them that not all weight issues are about over eating. That a whole spectrum of causes can lay behind it and you don't know exactly why someone is the size they are. To automatically assume the worst and ridicule them accordingly is both ignorant, innacurate and cruel. But after a while this feels like the fatass protesting to much. You start to internalize the shame. You loath yourself for failing to be the ideal. Even when your aware of the mindfuck, you still get sucked into it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

That's why I NEVER fat shame anyone or shame anybody for their appearance because I know firsthand how much that hurts.  However, there is a side to 'pop feminism' that instead of discouraging fat shaming, obesity and unhealthy eating/lifestyle habits are basically glorified; which I think is JUST as damaging.

"This is from the wikipeadia article for TV actor Mayim Bialik.  >>>After the Harvey Weinstein sexual misconduct allegations surfaced, Bialik penned an op-ed in The New York Times, in which she described the entertainment industry as one 'that profits on the exploitation of women ... [and] the objectification of women'.  With regard to protecting herself from sexual harassment, Bialik wrote that she dressed modestly and did not act flirtatiously with men, adding, 'In a perfect world, women should be free to act however they want. But our world isn't perfect. Nothing - absolutely nothing - excuses men for assaulting or abusing women. But we can't be naive about the culture we live in.' Bialik's article drew immediate backlash from critics who said Bialik was insinuating that modesty and a conservative wardrobe can guard one against sexual assault, with Patricia Arquette tweeting, 'I have to say I was dressed non provocatively at 12 walking home from school when men masturbated at me. It's not the clothes.'In response, Bialik stated she regretted that the piece 'became what it became' and participated in a Facebook Live hosted by The New York Times to answer questions about the piece.   Okay, here's the thing.  I don't doubt that dressing conservatively and not flirting makes Mayim Bialik more secure in some situations, though it's certainly not a guarantee that she'll never be assaulted.  AT THE SAME TIME, women (and men) who flirt and dress provocatively and are harrassed or assaulted are not responsible for their abusers.   We need to get better at nuance.  Fat people often need to adjust their lifestyle, and AT THE SAME TIME,  fat shaming is a 100 per cent dick move.   Both things can be true.    I never had a problem with my weight.   Some of the fat shamers,  if they're under 35, are in for a rude awakening as they get older.  One myth is that fat people are lazy.  That's about 90 per cent bullshit.  Sleep deprivation can be a factor in metabolism, and working two jobs will make you fat, if both of them are desk jobs.  I've been skinny and I've been fat.

"I don't feel wholly convinced by your arguments here; I don't feel like you really address some of the main criticisms of 'fat acceptance',- That people worry fat acceptance risks simply pushing the goalpost of what is considered healthy weight, and that modern research shows there isn't such a thing as being 'healthy fat'; yeah people shouldn't be bullied, but if we as a society grow comfortable with a certain standard of health doesn't that risk further perpetuating that standard? Certainly we must do more than stigmatize it to fix the problem, but it still seems proper for society to maintain that obesity *is* a problem.  You argue, 'who are we to say someone should live healthier, it isn't our life,' But I feel that ignores the very real fact that health problems for other people impact society as a whole; Not only do societal health problems increase healthcare costs for everyone else, but it also puts a greater burden on society by lowering peoples ability to work/labor, and risks causing those people additional medical problems (Such as obesity damaging joints and muscles) to the point that those people later require physical help from others to perform simple daily tasks; it might sound silly, but the human frame simply isn't built for perpetually carrying that much weight, years of it on end can do irreparable and debilitating damage.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think obesity is more of a systemic issue than an individual one, in America at least. I don't think it's necessarily about fat acceptance or shaming, because being obese is objectively bad for one's health and we should want to avoid it as a society (and if someone WANTS to be fat so be it, but as you stated in the video, most obese people don't like being obese). I think it has to do with corporate entities using cheap products that hijack our brains' evolutionary desire for things that are high in fat, sugar, and sodium to prey upon the lower classes. Because if you look at it, most morbidly obese people are poor due to food deserts in inner cities (poor areas with no access to grocery stores with healthy options, mostly only convenience stores with processed pre-packaged foods) and fast food restaurants being largely cheaper than healthier options.   Of course we shouldn't shame individuals for being, that I agree with, but I think this video failed to examine America's system of systemic poverty among lower classes and the negative health effects that it brings. Also those who are poor have to work longer hours and have less free time to exercise. I don't have the statistic at hand, but I read somewhere that being impoverished in America has a hugely negative effect on life expectancy, largely because of the lack of available healthy foods and free-time to exercise.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"While I generally share your point of view in this video, I'll have to disagree that it is not immoral to be unhealthy, at least not in the society that we live in right now. If you're living in a country with pubically funded health care, you should at least try to be a smaller burden to society by not costing the the insurances way more money than the average guy, thus raising membership dues for everyone. Of course, if you just can't help it because you are sick, well there's no moral obligation to get better as fast as you can because you didn't choose to get sick. What you should maybe reflect on is whether excessive drinking, eating, smoking or endangering your health in general is truely 'just your own business'.   I guess my point is, that 'being healthy' does not inherently hold any moral value but it does at least a little in the context of our society.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"While I don't necessarily like the fat acceptance movement, I definitely agree that those you mentioned are assholes. My main problem with the fat acceptance movement is that it's not about acceptance, but rather veneration. Instead of simply not being assholes to those who are fat, which I suspect most people aren't, there seems to be a move even by you towards the end of seeing fat as beautiful, at least in a way. While there is nothing wrong with seeing fat as beautiful it has 2 critical flaws. Generally, like you pointed out, we can't necessarily change what we see as beautiful, you still want to be thin just like so many other people. Generally people feel this way. I much prefer a solution that doesn't attempt to change what I don't believe we really can. However even if we can change how people view fatness, will that really fix the problem? We can't view every body type as being beautiful. If we decide fat is beautiful, aesthetically so, then it is like that we will see skinny as ugly or at the very least not as good, leaving skinny people in the reversed position.   Now this is just critique and complaint that can go on forever, but I do actually have somewhat of a suggestion for a solution. Rather than an attempt to mold society for people I think it would be better to give people the tools to deal with society. It's kinda the give me the serenity to accept what I cannot change kinda thing. We can learn together to accept being fat if that truly cannot be changed. It's difficult and probably not a perfect solution, but it's definitely a hell of a lot easier and more  likely to succeed than changing something as entrained in our Society as our sense of beauty do that even solved the problem.

"The second point about personal responsibility and what the cause is i think is radically unimportant. At the end of the day, even if you take the absolute worst case scenario, where all the major fast foods are addictive as hell, a prevalence of processed foods, etc etc, at the end of the day you have two options, you can scream into the void or you can struggle to make your life a healthier one. You aren't going to stop mass producers from offering unhealthy foods, aside from your market choices, so at the end of the day you DO have to take responsibility. Of course the best environment to do that is with a good family and/or friendly support network who encourage you to eat better and work out together, but either way, you choose what goes into your body at the end of the day. On the first point i agree, i've never met someone who lost weight and kept it off from people being cruel, as i said, having that support network is key i think. especially for long term changes. on your third point about it being my business, i can understand that in your american context, but here in australia we have a socialized health care system, something i am all for btw. However i do not think someone with a born liver disorder should receive treatment before an alcoholic (assuming it comes down to that, which it can do) nor would i want my taxes going to subsidizing the effects of some things which are life choices, such as smoking, drug abuse and of course, unhealthy eating. The argument can be made that if one were to grow up in an impoverished house hold these things would be harder to avoid and less of a personal choice, but most people here are middle/trade class where there is enough wealth to make it a personal choice. Of course i wouldn't deny that person my taxes, but it personally makes me resentful as much as i am ashamed of that personality fault in myself.  Finally, the idea that we shouldn't do all we can to keep encouraging people to live healthier, and as you yourself said, happier lives. Like it or not, obesity is now one of the biggest health killers in the western world, so many diseases and health risks stem from it. The idea that we should normalize it is an absolute travesty to me, and is no different to trying to normalize the idea of smoking or excessive drinking (the second of which is unfortunately common). As i said before i do not condone shaming and bullying, however being forceful and clear about what it can do to your body (being obese) is not bullying. When my mother tells me she is scared im going to die and that i need to do something, that is out of love, not bullying (i am overweight btw). Instead i think that sporting and active culture should be promoted but more important than anything; real commitment to making sure people understand completely that the healthiest diet is simply the non processed one, fresh fruit,  vegitables and low processed meat like beef, lamb, whole fish ect.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I never judge anyone on this issue with one notable exception. Parrents raisng morbidly obese children. I do feel that is harming the child. A child lacks the knowledge and wisdom to decide if the consequences of eating unhealthy and not exercizing is worth it for the harm their future self may suffor (back and joint pain, diabeties, unattractiveness/ disdain, shortened lifespan etc.) An Adult is free to make what choises they wish with their own body, but just as I would never condone letting your 8 year old child drink alcohol because he/she wants to I likewise would not condone leting a child become obese before he/she had the cognitive capacity to determine eating nothing but junk food and being super heavy is worth it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"This video and its arguments are utterly confused and disconnected.  First, showing that fat-shaming is bad does not mean fat acceptance is good.  Second, you show that America's weight problem is caused by many things.  I agree - although it's mostly just the high carb, high sugar, processed foods.  If we agree that this weight problem is relatively new, and caused by our horrible food options, why on earth would you want us to just accept this new paradigm?!  We see people are eating unhealthfully to the point that they're getting massively overweight and dying at an early age, and your answer is that we should accept a wider array of body types?  Why don't we, I don't know, try and do something about the major factors that are pushing horrible food on us?  Maybe we shouldn't have billion dollar marketing campaigns that target children with sugary food?  No, no, let's embrace hedonism...  Which brings me to another important point.  The reason people can't lose or keep weight off is because they continue to eat high carb.  This is often because doctors tell people to eat high carb.  We should be changing the dietary guidelines, getting doctors up to speed on the effects of carbs, etc.  Saying, there's nothing we can do because people who ate high carb and continue to eat carbs can't lose weight is foolish.  And if you think low/no carb is just another fad diet, it really isn't.  Mankind has no need whatsoever for carbohydrates.  You will die if you don't eat fat or protein, but you can survive without carbs indefinitely.  Carbs cause insulin resistance, carbs and the insulin responses they induce prevent fat burning, carbs cause increased hunger, the volatility of relying the glucose to run your brain and body causes mind fog and horrible hunger pangs.  I could go on and on.  This serious problem of weight gain can be addressed through sensible application of science and logic.  Saying, we should just accept people's different sizes is totally ignoring the problem.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Awww yis, Howlin' Wolf!  I appreciate you making an argument against fat-shaming. I've been obese since I was about 11 and moved in with my grandmother. I'd moved from a rural area where I could bike, rollerblade and explore to an exurb where I had the option of trying to bike/rollerblade on streets so badly maintained that cars had issues or roads with too much traffic to safely use without any other 'safe' places for me to be a dumb kid. Throw in some PTSD (related to other things) and I ate huge amounts of food that astound me now. I think if I'd been a little older, I'd have turned to drugs/alcohol/sex instead. Pretty sure I'd have preferred that. The study talking about obese people preferring to be thin and having a disability to being obese is pretty accurate in that respect.  I will also say that while exercise has recently come under a spotlight for not really doing as much for weight loss as initially thought (namely because the body changes its energy expenditure the more you exercise), food consumption is still currently one of the few ways to seriously achieve weight loss. Doctors recommending it is important. What is also *hugely* important is *how* they recommend it.   I finally got a GP properly for the first time in my life a few years ago. Her attitude is very supportive and, while she definitely tells me things I don't always like, they are never couched in a mean spirit. I feel support from her, rather than judgment. That isn't something I've encountered often when getting a doctor. It's why I bothered to actually start seeing her and talking to her about my various health concerns. Not every conversation with her leads to bringing up weight loss.   (And while it seems rational for a doctor to bring up weight loss, if every doctor you went to did it on almost every visit for anything - 'You're having breathing problems because of bronchitis after getting the flu, but you also need to lose weight.' - it would start to wear very thin. I suspect smokers have a similar issue with doctors.)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Shaming people for being fat is messed up. But the bulk of it seems to come from seeing those who completely ignore the reality that obesity is unhealthy and dangerous for that person. When you have people saying healthy at any weight that is a complete delusion. Also i have seen some of their vids like blairs. I didn't feel shamed or bullied from it. She made it about the delusion of healthy at any weight advocacy. So being fat isn't a reason to just dump insults on someone but if that person is saying my body is healthy when they are 400lbs they are just lying. I have been there at 400lbs its not healthy it destroys your body. Even after losing 140lbs i feel better but the damage i did is permanent. No one shamed me til i lost weight. I decided when my heart started to fail to control my diet. You have to hit rock bottom in addiction and want to change. Without a desire from within you won't change. I had to stick to a diet or i was going to die... So yeah if you choose to eat yourself to death power to you that is your right as an individual. But don't pretend your healthy. I am still struggling to lose weight but i have far more control after i decided to live. When you actually feel your heart failing it gives you a lot of incentive to choose life and change your behavior. It has to come from within yourself a serious desire to change.

"There's a very simple reason everyone is getting so fat and that has to do with the major companies maximise the amount of sugar, fat and salt in their product to make the food addictive. They're all chasing the 'bliss point'. Modern food causes hormonal imbalances that make it impossible to regulate your hunger, satiety and weight, it's basically triggering a chronic disease.  So no, obesity is not good or even ok, it's a diseased state in most cases. Obesity is very different from body diversity, ie having a big ass, no hips or funny ears is very different from obesity and suffering from metabolic disease.  Fat shaming as tough love is obviously bullshit... but we do need tough love when it comes to obesity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"While I don't think any sort of shaming is cool, I'm not sure we should encourage people to go ahead and be unhealthy. The little I know about 'fat acceptance' involves (albeit on the extreme side) people who are convinced that, despite their obesity, are healthy. And I wouldn't say other's obesity totally don't affect us at all. Resulting health issues mean a strain on the healthcare system, for one thing. But I think maybe we should look at obesity like we look at smokers. We all know smoking is unhealthy and the people who do smoke know it's unhealthy for the most part. Occasionally friends and family members will remind their loved one to stop smoking because they care about them. Some smokers will go off and hide to smoke alone in shame. I haven't heard anything about smoker shaming. I guess because 'fatness' is a physical attribute, people are sensitive about it, while smoking used to be the think the cool kids did.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I know there are a lot of factors that can lead you to being fat, a lot of them are way out of the concerned person's control but you could say the same thing about the correlation between epigenetics and smoking or the cultural stigma attached to not drinking in some younger communities. Isn't just accepting the fact people are gonna be fat and people are gonna keep dying to 'fat-related' illness defeatist?  Shaming fat people for being fat is not a good way of facing the issue, IMO, for multiple reasons, the same reasons why shaming people for drinking never stopped me from getting piss-drunk twice a week for years but I can't shake the feeling that being fat is inherently bad, as a health hazard.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"What is milo smoking in that picture? If so it's a bit hypocritical for him to be attacking others for their bad health when he's killing himself with with his own bad health. As someone who has had issues with both ends of extreme eating (yeah I either over eat or severely under eat, I can't win on the dieting front, these days I'm just happy that I can eat without freaking out even if what I'm eating is crap) it can be hard to find the balance and some people (like myself) just gain weight really easily, I could eat a salad and run a mile and still probably gain weight (I only eat one small meal a day for months and levelled out at 7 stone and couldn't go any lower, that's how hard it is for me to lose weight). And some just can't exercise (used to but the exercise caused medical problems with my legs and now I can't, yes exercise made it so I can't exercise, fucking brilliant, well no idea what to do now, I could go swimming but that involves transport and public changing rooms which are really uncomfortable and normally involves money of some sort and I'm unemployed). Then there's time and money some just can't afford to pay for a gym membership and transport to and from the gym or just don't have the time and energy after a long day and some people just like tasty food and would rather not waste their tiny amount of time eat disgusting leaves in an effort to add another ten years at most onto their lives, ten years that would probably be spent in a retirement home or at a job or sitting in a chair shouting nonsense at the TV and the mail man, while some carer comes round and feeds you tablets (I'll take the heart attack at 55 and avoid all of that, thanks, at least then I can enjoy my food). Yes healthy eating is important but people shouldn't be bothered if they are a bit over weight, should I lose weight yes, should others probably, that's their call, should some eat more yes but we all have bad habits and attacking others rudely isn't going to help, be kind and supportive is far better.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

If you did a study of 1000 people with toe injuries it would have a variety of causes including alcohol consumption and shoe design and running trends and increasing body weight...  The right wing tendency is to focus on individual responsibility (don't get drunk and jump down stairs) and the left wing tendency is to look at society level responsibility (can we redesign running shoes to reduce the chance of chronic injury).

"I think the answer lies between what provocateurs say and what you say.  Society SHOULDN'T embrace 'fat acceptance', in the sense that the fat acceptance movement does; the denial that weight and health go hand in hand, and the espousing of being fat as 'just another look' is harmful to society on every level. So losing weight is hard? Tough shit. Anything in life that's worth accomplishing is hard, and yes, it DOES boil down to 'calories in, calories out'. You're not gonna magically have more gas in the body's proverbial tank regardless of your genetics. Your body might naturally consumer fewer calories due to genetics, or more calories from the same cause, and hormones might affect that as well, but it's more a matter of adjusting at that point than gaining weight and blaming your body's natural wiring for your weight loss.  The solution is simple: be fat and happy, or lose some weight. You can be a big guy/girl/whatever you want to call yourself, but you have to know... in the pit of your stomach... that what your condition in is bad for you, and not just you, but those around you. After all, do you think your children will like knowing you might die of a heart attack or stroke before they have a chance to have children of their own? Do you think it might be less of a burden on healthcare providers (and therefore reduce costs for everyone- you included) to maintain a healthy weight and avoid obesity related illnesses?  This idea of yours that we should glorify any aspect of obesity (especially hedonism, perhaps the most empty and meaningless of ideologies) is inherently harmful.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"While I agree with most things you said in this video, one thing you did overlook was the impact the obesity crisis is having on our healthcare systems. It really is costing us a fuckton of money and resources, as well as the simple fact of impaired quality of life for people struggling with obesity. What's the solution? I don't know. I think you kind of hinted on the fact that our society is basically geared towards making people fat. Perhaps severe restrictions on the availability and promotion of deeply unhealthy foods. However, we all know how much Ronald McDonald is now an American icon, so good luck getting anything like that to pass. Maybe we're just doomed to be a civilisation of fatsos.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Here is an interesting thing. I used to eat cheese balls, sour candy and drink soda on a daily basis. Now that I rarely eat junk food and drink soda, I put ON weight. I was a little thicker in 5th grade, but then as time went on I became thinner. My mother pointed out, that I looked very thin in my 9th grade graduation photos. At the time, I still ate junk food. To a lesser extent, but I did. Now, on the brink of graduating 12th grade, I eat healthier than ever and I know for a fact, that I have put on weight. No, my diet and health are not perfect but I have cut out junk food and generally improved my diet. My skin is also clearer than it used to be.

"Yes, any type of 'shaming' is unlikely to solve any health problem. I'm not sure what to make of fat 'acceptance' though. There exists an obesity problem in the US and it's becoming a problem in the UK as well. I do not think that the availability of very fattening foods and the extra cost that comes with eating healthy as well as the sedentary lifestyles promoted by most urban lines of work help though. I remember a period when I had very little money, it was impossible to not put on weight without eating very little. Vegetables are expensive.

"The fact that your genetics make you store more fat and that you are big boned doesn't mean that you cannot be fit. My brother could be considered a 'fat person' and the research you brough up could describe him. He is  working out nonetheless. It's about health no the looks. He has great cardio and strenght, who cares about a little belly. People that look at fitness models and say 'this is what being healthy is. I cannot achieve that because of my genetics' are very wrong. Other animals store a lot of fat too. It's not about having a six pack, it's about improving the quality of your life, having more longevity, getting out of your comfort zone. Giving up because you cannot reach unrealistic results and unatural (looking at nature) results makes the problem worse. If you'll have kids they will be even more degenerated geneticly. So to sum it up, just because you have a genetic tendency doesn't mean you cannot be healthy. Just stop eating fast food and sweets, live naturally, like how a human is designed to by nature, understand body types and athleticism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

You're allowed to smoke them, but it's a good idea to let people know that it's not the best for your health and to prevent children from becoming addicted early on.

"Fat shaming is bullshit, as are those people who claim that obesity has no detrimental effects on health.  And when it comes down to pure mechanics, it is calories in/out. The yo-yo effect is a mental problem, not something your body does on its own. There are some disorders and effects of dieting that lower the amount of calories you burn, but that's in the range of maybe 300kcl. In the grand scheme of things you will lose weight if you use more calories than you consume, physiological details aside. They make a difference but not an insurmountable one. Otherwise people who live in areas afflicted by food shortages would be starving themselves fat.  The hardest part is what's going on inside your own head. Which is a real problem that can make weightloss incredibly, incredibly hard, but which doesn't mean it's a biological pipe dream, not gonna happen, why don't we just give up. As for the Milos and Katie Hopkins's of the world, they can go die in a ditch.

I'm in grade 12 now (almost 18) and the truth is, even though I finally eat now I will never recover the intense fear of becoming fat. I was 90 pounds and I still never looked like those thin Victoria's secret models. My legs and arms were paper thin but I didn't look anything like it did before. Now I weigh 105 pounds now, but I look like I weigh like the average 150 pound woman (not saying that as self pity. A lot of 150 pound women look amazing, but the fact that many people agree that I look 50 pounds more than I really am).  The fact that even though I eat less than average, exercise, drink water, and STILL look fat (not 'not toned' but fat) feels like proof to me that no matter what I will never be skinny. That I was just supposed to be heavier-looking than other people.  Sucks because even though I know this, I won't mentally accept this. I'd still kill someone if it meant I could be thin and attractive.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I wish people would have a little more common sense on this issue. Yes, being fat is unhealthy, but it is never okay to bully people. If you are really concerned about someone's health due to their weight, give them words of encouragement, not scorn. You are right that these people are just looking for a socially acceptable way to bully others.   Then there is the other side where people are starting to see fatness as aspirational. Being morbidly obese is no more aspirational then being a smoker or an alchoholic. It concerns me to see people throwing caution to the wayside, gaining weight carelessly, and then finding out that it wasn't such a good idea when they start to experience the negative health implications.   But above everything else, it's important to recognise that this is a systematic problem, not an individual one. The food industry, along with the social fabric, is designed in a way that makes people fat. Not everyone is going to have the genetics, education, money, socialization or will power to prevent themselves from being fat in a world that constantly bombards their senses with the smells and images of food. It's a constant battle against our survival instincts telling us we have to eat everything we see. In some ways, food is an even stronger addiction than cigarettes and alchohol because it is something you have to consume on a regular basis. How well do you think an alchoholic would do trying to quit if they had to drink at least one drink a day to survive? Obesity truly is an epidemic.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I can no longer exercise without setting the bar so high and having such unrealistic expectations for myself related to weight loss and conforming to other societal expectations (such as how far and how long I should be able to run, how much weight I should be able to lift and other such metrics). the only real tangible result of this is that I end up in a spiral of self-loathing, anxiety and panic attacks that sooner or later causes me to give up on exercising for the sake of my mental health.

"For anecdote's sake, I used to be really fat, almost obese, hated myself to the gut until I met a thing called self love and only when I accepted myself I was able to lose weight, not just because of any dietary restriction or exercise routine, but because I felt better in general so my willingness to learn about nutrition, my body and specially mi mind was clearly higher.  Another thing I want to point out about so-called 'fat shaming' which you brilliantly said is a really soft way of saying internalized fatphobia and outright bullying. The way people treated me after I became thin changed completely, to the point it made me want to be fat again so I could avoid cat-calling and another mysoginistc bullshit. To a more subtle extent, I realized that I was considerably more invisible when I was fat, less people would talk to me, people were less open with me despite nothing having changed much inside of me aside from my weight loss. I was just as depressed as when I was fat, even more so because of a shitty relationship at the time, but regardless, in a point of my life, I was more rude, more negative and generally more of a shit of a person but people still gave me way more atention than when I was fat.

"Why rather than just promote fat acceptance don't also promote working on the causes of obesity? I mean, historically it's clearly a new event (as the graphic shows), and as you said there might be many causes behind that. Let's talk about what I believe is the main cause, bad food, but it will work analogously with other cause. There is a LOT of consumption of junk food, sugar added food, trans fat food, etc. Why not to limit that amount of added sugar food can have? Why not reduce advertising of junk food? (Along with advertising with unattainable bodies). Promoting body acceptances is important but if there is not cutting on the cause then the prevalence of obesity will keep or even rise. Given that it is a health problem (we can debate about that but I believe some version of the argument still works) then we should treat it from a public policy perspective, preventing and intervening on the causes. Then given that those actions will take time promote fat acceptance as a mean to manage the fact that 30% of the population feel shame of their body. In taking a health public policy perspective I'm trying to differentiate from those you accused in the video, because they see the cause in a lack of will, lack of effort, etc, all problems within the individual action spectrum (a individualistic liberal approach).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Waste? Medical costs? To make people feel better?  (Please note: I'm not suggesting we make it ok to be assholes to people about their weight or body type.)  Societal fatness is a signal that people are buying into corporate bullshit. Relinquishing more control to private entities that definitely do not share common goals with the consumer -- and destroying personal and ecologic health while at it.  In many ways, I feel like fat acceptance (your 'excess') is a capitalist, individualistic, and apathetic trait. Not a romantic one. We don't have to be perfect, but it helps to be aware that our consumption habits have consequences.  It's hard for me to ignore that aspect of fatness.

If everyone who was overweight were mindful of calorie and nutrient information though and bought accordingly, the US and other western nations would be in a lot better shape.   tldr : I agree that shaming is not the solution but I can't deal with fat positivists in general those fucks take it too far sometimes.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

And I particularly disagree with blaming others (food, society, TV, McDonald's) instead of individual behavior for obesity, given that weight is in fact mostly 'calories in, calories out.' The statement that individual behavior has nothing or little to do with obesity is plainly false and it leads to people who are already obese become more irresponsible with their health.  If you're fat and you think it's worth of it, that's totally respectable; it's your body and your health (the same if you're a drug addict, an alcoholic or whatever activity/habit that could damage yourself). But don't try to blame others for it or dismiss the fact that obesity causes major health problems, or attempt to convince others that they're terrible persons for not finding fat people physically appealing, which apparently are the things that fat acceptance movement is most into.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I know this is an old video (which I generally agree with)- but a couple of thoughts:  - calling the effort to lose weight 'heroic' does carry implications that it is good and noble for fat people use weight, even if you are only using it in the sense that heroic can also mean extreme -since overweight people are significantly more likely than thin people to fit the criteria for eating disorders, it seems a little callous to include a segment in which you  binge and purge as (presumably) a joke -imo there's really no need to celebrate fatness as 'glorious excess' or whatever. like. fat people are just people whose existence should not have to be justified by saying 'fatness is a sign of a good and rich life' or vilified by saying 'fatness is a sign of greed and excess'. fat people just need to be allowed to exist without our bodies being looked at without moral judgment. -far bigger problems exist for fat people than milo/4chan/whoever's shitty opinion that fat people should be shamed at every turn. the medical abuse of fat people is rampant, and fat people often struggle to physically exist in public, since even simple things such as chairs and clothing are designed to exclude fat people. obviously these things are tied together in a culture of fat hatred -again, saying 'I'll go full degenerate and gain a bunch of weight', as if weight is actually something that one can easily control, and that fatness has a moral value (degeneracy), not ideal. like. saying 'maybe someday I will stop caring about my weight' has a very different connotation than 'I will become a degenerate and gain weight'  like I said, I overall agree with what you're saying and I'm glad you examined your own relationship to the ideal of thinness, but I think the message could have been communicated in a slightly better way","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"9:06  I've heard this argument before, however is there any proof that culturally ideal figures are a bad thing?  I mean obviously not everyone out there is going to be a sports illustrated model or Stallone, but why is it bad that people aspire to be like them and maybe make some moderate improvement to their own health and fitness?  For example, I quit smoking because I wanted to have the lifestyle of some people I admire.  Shaming didn't help me quit, but at the same time neither did 'acceptance'. Watching people live a better life than me was the motivating factor, and my life is remarkably better.    Also, some of those health studies about weight loss cited in this video has been heavily rebutted by many journals.

"I like that we're having this discussion, and I agree that self-harm and abuse are neither helpful nor even basically effective, let alone 'okay'... HOWEVER, the fact remains that obese people like ME and the health problems WE are uniquely disproportionately predisposed for are the single biggest chunk of extraneous cost in the ENTIRE healthcare industry. You know how America pays more per capita on healthcare than any other nation on earth by nearly an entire order of magnitude yet somehow still receives the SHITTIEST quality of care in the entire world? And yeah it DEFINITELY IS. And it's because of complications linked DIRECTLY TO OBESITY. We should NOT be normalizing fatness by creating role models specifically to be fat! Whether or not you like it, the REASON there's any value at all to be found in an epidemiological perspective on this issue is because IT *IS* AN EPIDEMIC. This shit WAS NOT HAPPENING fifty years ago! But you're right about another thing: it _isn't_ because of 'gluttony' or 'sloth'. We as a species are being *poisoned*. By what? Well remember that what makes a poison poisonous is THE DOSE. Warfarin is the same chemical as rat poison. Novacane's primary active ingredient is COCAINE. Even WATER becomes toxic past a certain LD50.   There's a chemical naturally occurring in basically every plant we can eat. It's so prevalent that our genetics have evolved to program us to seek it out by setting up an automatic dopamine response when we ingest it. We're also programmed to interpret it's flavor as 'sweet', because IN NATURE it wasa reliable signal that a plant was safe for us to eat. Nature NEVER intended for us to extract this chemical compound, concentrate it, distill it, refine it, and put ABSURDLY COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF IT IN *_EVERYTHING._* it's SUGAR. and we're eating more of it now than ever before. We're using it to override the bitter and sour signals that are supposed to tell us when something is bad for us. Ask yourself, if you have to load 30 FUCKING grams of sugar into something to make it palatable, WHY SHOULD WE BE EATING IT!? We are *abusing this substance*, and it is abusing us right back.   We bought into this insane fallacy that eating fat is what makes people fat, _succeeded_ in cutting our fat consumption in half, and proceeded to watch in horror as our population's waistlines EXPLODED. WHAT A FASCINATING CORRELATION HUH? It's because eating sugar, eating _starch,_ tells our hunter gatherer bodies that this is gathering season and winter is around the corner. The hormone that tells our cells to take on glucose for energy ALSO tells our hypothalamus to STAY HUNGRY, EAT MORE, MOVE LESS, STORE STORE STORE. Insulin. And in obese people, this whole system is past a tipping point into haywire territory.   'Fat acceptance' is going to bankrupt us, and already kills THOUSANDS of people _every single gods damned year_ from the chronic cumulative effects of obesity. For the first time since the enlightenment, life expectancy prospects have REGRESSED, and it's because of this!   Fellow obese people I implore you: do NOT give in, do NOT accept your fat, you are NOT consigned to imprisonment in this sarcophagus of adipose tissue. I PROMISE YOU, do but this ONE THING and you will reclaim your life: give your body the winter it has been preparing for over all these years. Let yourself be hungry, hunger is not persistent, it comes in waves; challenge yourself to two waves, then three, then four - FEEL your agency return to your grasp! And when you eat, reach for FAT. NOT SUGAR. We've been avoiding fat and embracing sugar all our lives and look what it's gotten us... Avoid sugar. If the nutrition label says more than 5g sugar per serving, for the love of FUCK PLEASE choose something else. Disparage carbs but glorify fiber. It isn't as hard as it sounds - this is what your body WANTS to do. Fat has insanely high satiety that comes quicker and persists for much, MUCH longer. You won't feel any lack at all. I'm a nobody and I did it, losing 50 pounds. I believe in you more than I believe in me.   Don't give up, you're not alone.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"dude, being fat is damaging to your health no matter what. No matter what you do, it won't change that fact. The point that milo and blaire are making (specially blaire, you are kind of right about milo) is that a glorification and a normalization of obesity is wrong, because of the reason i gave before. That doesn't make bullying ok, that doesn't mean that you should shame anyone for it, or that you don't have to think about all the complicated nuances and specifics that go when you deal with this. And yes, an obsession  with a thin figure can be dangerous, but i don't think that keep celebrating beautiful 'thin' bodies is wrong, peoplelike that shit as well other types of bodies depending of the person. Besides, if anything i have learnt by hanging out on the internet is that people are into all kind of bodies; big ones, packed ones, mildly fat, you name it.

"I think the main reason obesity rose was because you're classified obese by your BMI, which is body mass index. It is just your weight divided by your height. It was never made to be about individual health, it was meant to study populations with. It does not take into account what that weight is, be it fat, muscle or bone. Thus alot of people who are very healthy and don't even look fat are considered obese, people like Johnny Depp or Arnold Schwarzenegger. It is completely useless in determining how healthy you are. And the worst part? The BMI for obese used to be 45, it was changed to 30. No explanation seems to have been given, most nutritionists don't know either. It seems the reason was so that they could play up an 'obesity epidemic' and make more people think that they're unhealthy and need to buy their nutritional products. So the obesity epidemic may just be fabricated. Overall though aesthetically healthy and actually healthy are two different things. You can be very fat and healthy as long as you exercise and eat right, you could also be thin and very unhealthy if you don't. Biological health is about keeping your body well exercised and fed, not about getting a certain aesthetic.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I love you, but I think you need to have a good, long think about why thinness (and also some mildly toned muscles) is (/are) important to you and so many other people. After you've come up with some answers, or at least some theories, I think it would be beneficial for you and your viewers if you revisited this subject.  What I'm getting at is that if thin people want to stay thin and fat people want desperately to *be* thin, might not there be just a sliver of universality and--dare I say it?--truth to the notion that humans are, by nature, predisposed to find the 'ideal' body attractive? Can something of this global a scale even BE engineered (save by genetics)?  I agree that shaming fat people is pointless at best and cruel at worst. But fat epicureans are already subject to celebration so I don't see a need to further enhance their celebrity. They're already a plenty lovable archetype. I say just let people work out their issues as they see fit without any engineering in either direction.  Which brings us back to my original point and the portion of your video that I found fairly unsettling: why do you speak about your desire for thinness like it's a problem? Have you considered that maybe those desires are 'normal' (innately human, in this context) and that your seemingly negative attitude is the result of a perspective skewed (got tired of saying engineered) by the zeitgeist and the midst I imagine you find yourself in?  All of this must've sounded distinctly condescending, but all my questions were asked in the spirit of genuine inquiry and debate. So when I ask 'Have you considered...', I'm actually asking if what follows factored into your conclusions on this matter and not subtly saying 'choke on my opinions, you idiot'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"While I think fat shaming shouldn't be done (it's probably one of the most likely reasons for people to develop eating disorders) I don't subscribe to the fat acceptance movement. I don't believe you should praise people for being so fat it's unhealthy just as I would definitely not praise someone for losing too much weight. I would praise someone who was obese and lost that weight and I would praise a dangerously skinny person for gaining healthy weight. I think we should always encourage health and healthy ideas and of course remind people to not overdo it. Still I do think it's inappropriate to push that onto people (especial people they don't know), but then the person may be at risk of disease or death and it may be unethical to not to stress that their weight is an issue. Some people also have issue with obese people costing tax payers more because of their health conditions. I can't really say anything on that because I don't pay taxes.   but anyway,  just to reiterate, fat shaming= bad so no one thinks I advocate for bullying.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Shaming people doesn't fucking work. So once upon a time I was part of the vegan community and I was gaining a lot of weight and I wasn't sure why (apparently it had something to do with my thyroid and how lack of protein was making me gain a lot of weight) so my highest weight was 150ish back in december 2016. I was like 5lbs overweight at the most (and i'm hella short so i kinda look chubby anyway) and these vegans fucking shamed the shit out of me and told me I was being a slob and I needed to stop being a 'fake' vegan BECAUSE there was no way a vegan could be overweight. Long story short. I ended up getting depressed and unhappy and binge eating and that doesn't help. Few months later I started eating meat again for the first time in like 4 years and I lost 15lbs in a month. That was last month. I'm still losing weight. Which is good. And I've never felt better. Shaming did not make me lose weight. Loving myself enough to say that 'I need to make the healthy change my body needs' is what made me lose weight. I don't believe we should let obesity be a norm and we should try to help obese people learn ways to buy the right foods and eat healthy and exercise. But how is calling someone a fat slob helping? It reminds me of nicole arbour on The View when the one girl was like 'yeah, well maybe try to help obese kids if you care so much, instead of bullying them'.

"You are rightly criticizing the right-wing trolling brigade, but that doesn't mean that everything you say is correct, because disagreeing with the troll brigade is not really an accomplishment. I actually think that you misunderstand the dangers of fat acceptance. Of course we should discourage people from bullying people based on their weight. But if we normalize unhealthy behaviours too much, and even claim, that they are totally ok, the health aspect gets thrown under the bus too much. What the fat acceptance community effectively did, was create the image, that unhealthy behaviours are ok and can even be sexy. At the same time some of these hypocrites shame bulimics and thin people for having an unhealthy beauty standard. We should not go to a point of really accepting fat, we should only go to a point of accepting fat people(!). Otherwise we are really normalizing unhealthy behaviour to a point that doctors are viewed as fat-shamers.  It's like anti-muslim bigotry. I don't have to support Islam to understand the dangers of hating muslims, but some people do in fact support Islam just for the sake of attacking the bullies. But we shouldn't become the mirror of haters and accept things just because people are hating people due to these factors.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Although I really like your other videos I strongly disagree with this one. Of course we should accept diversity and so on, but we shouldn't accept the fact that people are getting more and more unhealthy and not even able to walk by themselfs anymore or being imprisoned by their own body. If hormones, food, medicine etc are the reason for increasing your weight, the focus should be one finding a solution and not being like 'well, since these are the reasons, I can't do anything against it anyway'. I know Americans have different health insurance system than other countries. But more and more money is needed for treating the results of overweight children and adults. So if someone has diabetes or whatever and would die at 50 I wouldn't care at all. It's your body, eat, smoke, drink till you fall over, but this is not the case, since there are effects on the health system. Wanting to be thin can be something society puts in your head, or can be the search for a healthy lifestyle. Why telling people they should feel bad about wanting to have a good physique? So, to cut a long story short, this video (for me) takes all bad feelings of the overweight people and throws them to skinny people to make THEM feel bad.

I honestly care about her, we are close in age and have always hung out and been really good friend, not just family.. Would me caring about her be to just sit back while she eats McDonald's every day, is borderline diabetic and cannot play with her 3 year old child because she gets winded too quickly OR would me truly caring be to try and get her to the gym with me, get on a solid healthy diet and support her and help her obtain her dreams of moving up at her job and becoming a corrections officer, which require her to be physically fit in order to pass physical tests??

"I hate fat acceptance for many reasons(the many retards who advertise it makes it worse). I am overweight but I dont think bullying anyone for their weight seriously is retarded. In psychology, I learned that it is harder for a person who is obese to lose weight and keep it off because of things called fat cells. They inflate from small amount of calorie intakes. Its easier to not be fat if you were never fat however, accepting that you are fat and not wanting to do anything about it is horrible. It doesnt stop the huge amount of people dying from heart disease,etc. Believing that you can never be healthy weight is discouraging and just not true. Others being fat and needing to get medical help due to that affects us all(in the US). It causes us to pay for it.

"100% agree that fat shaming is not the answer. If shaming worked, then nobody would be fat because we already shame the hell out of people as it is (especially women), and fat people generally have a ton of internalized shame already.  I do think it is possible for some people, if not many people, biologically at least to lose fat and/or gain muscle. I myself was chronically underweight at an unhealthy level and so learned all about how it works, and yes energy balance is a major factor here. That said, it is a serious commitment in time and energy, and there is billions of dollars of disinformation which ultimately just confuses the fuck out of everyone in terms of how to actually do it. If everyone had all the right information, it should still be matter of personal preference and none of anyone else's business. And even then, it's a matter of changing all sorts of unconscious habits which are being continually shaped by multi-national food corporations and marketing and the design of our environments, all of which is incredibly difficult to change on one's own.  I do think we have ethical duties to do a small amount of exercise and to look after our own health, because no one else can do it, because it can cause harm or benefit to a human being worthy of care, and because our own health habits also inevitably affect others. But I don't think that looks like more than an hour or two a week of moving one's body, trying to cut back on one's addictions, and eating some veggies once in a while. And ultimately health and appearance are rather unrelated variables in any case. Bodybuilders are often very unhealthy -- it's not unheard of for someone to die on stage of a heart attack. The weight loss and fitness communities are full of disordered eating and exercising behaviors that are sources of self-harm and obsession. It is rare to find someone who has struck a healthy balance with all this stuff, and I think it's worth seeking, but certainly not something to impose upon others.  If anything, we should think about how to structure societies such that more movement is built in to our environments (e.g. bike lanes and walking malls), and more health food options are available to underserved communities (e.g. urban gardens).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"This is a really good video. I don't agree with a lot of your opinions, but you always have good points and I enjoy listening to you. I like Blaire white and some of the other youtubers similar to her, but it is obvious that they just rely on ad hominem attacks to appeal to a certain crowd. I don't think we should encourage people who are 'fat' due to behavior that is hurting them and their body, but if the people like Blaire White really cared they 1) Wouldn't make generalizations about over weight people without citing studies and 2) Say a lot of things to make them feel worse about themselves. There are so many better ways to go about helping people if you really care. From personal experience, exercising and eating more healthily helps me physically and emotionally feel better (I could probably cite studies that list other benefits, but I'm not really here to fight or debate) but you are 100% right about it not being my business. No one can tell anyone else how to live their life. If you think they are living a bad life style, you do not have to agree.

"I'm slightly overweight because I have hypothyroidism (not enough thyroxin=slow metabolism, tiredness, dry skin, etc.). The ironic thing is that my doctor thinks that because of my history of anorexia and bulimia, my thyroid function started to slow down during the period of my life when I was severely underweight, starving myself, and later binging and purging because my body has probably developed metabolic mechanisms of keeping on as much weight as possible ever since. I'm not fat(-ish) because I'm greedy and indulgent, I'm fat(-ish) because I was told almost from childhood that the main concern when we eat and exercise should be how we look and how attractive (read: skinny) we are, which caused me to be *too* disciplined and restrictive. The advice that these shitlords are giving couldn't be more counter-productive, not just because it may affect people in the same way it did me, but because restricting what you eat in any way can cause some people to binge eat if they get upset and restless about how they look and are super-consciously ashamed of how they got that way. My usual impression when I hear someone giving 'advice' like this is that they probably have either a faster metabolism, a greater sense of self-control, or just don't really care either way about food, and therefore they probably haven't experienced the same issues as the people in question. Yes, being overweight or obese is definitely not good for you, but there isn't any effort on the part of these people to consider biological or psychological factors. It's not 'acceptance' or 'being a pussy', it's the most logical and constructive way to address such a widespread and often life-threatening problem.

Wouldn't something akin to sex-ed about nutrition and general self care (in the 'caring for your body, as any machine it too needs judicious use') be more productive?

"something else i find relevant, is that semi-recently, the BMI scale was redefined, and suddenly people who were in the 'ideal zone' wer deemed overweight.  there's also many scientific criticisms of the BMI scale, considering that it doesn't distinguish between fat and muscle, or take into account the mass of bones either.  a lot of research still uses the BMI scale as its only measurement, but the BMI scale puts many body-builders in 'overweight' or 'obese' (-- whether or not pushing your body to make as much muscle as it possibly can over a course of years puts stress on their body's systems isn't something i'm going to go into, considering that mainstream 'health' attitudes are based entirely around the level of fat, so women are told that skinny supermodels are their peak look, and men are told it's body builders, even though both require really extreme lifestyles to maintain.) so some papers question how relevant the science done on the BMI scale really is.  i have a genetic disorder, and recently my weight went down, despite noticing that i was a bit fatter. this was either muscle mass or bone mass (could be either, due to mutations), but some nurses were just like 'oh well done!' even though it was probably bad. my actual dietary specialist wasn't, but, still. because, like you said, it's the body type goal that people focus on, rather than the actual lifestyle stuff, people will often reward unhealthy behaviour as 'healthy'.   i would also like to briefly mention that, in real terms, not only is 'overeating' something that can make people gain fat, but also lots of eating disorders do. people who will not eat for 24 or more hours and then eat the equivalent of one meal or two (like me, often, hi) will gain weight because the body is desperately conserving everything because of instincts that food is scarce and could run out soon. but then misguided people, including general practitioners, may give advice like 'try to eat less', which causes the periods of starvation to increase, which leads to the body conserving even more. in fact, i almost didn't get any diagnoses for my mutation, because one of my doctors said my pain was just due to being too fat. (i was then told if i'd followed his advice, i might have snapped my spine. great!)  i recently read a good article about this phenomenon, which if you're still reading comments, you may find interesting (or may have already read) URL includes such gems as: a woman's cancer going undiagnosed because her sudden weight loss was just congratulated instead of investigated.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is one of the greatest videos on this topic I've ever seen. It's nuanced and understands that there's more to health, or attractiveness, than meets the eye. Sure, conventional attractiveness is nice, but that doesn't mean and it will never mean that everyone SHOULD find the same things beautiful or attractive. Some people will NEVER find thin bodies attractive no matter what you do, and those people deserve a platform at some point. Because it shouldn't be like being in the closet, yet it feels shameful to be attracted to fat men or fat women since society says it is disgusting. Along with Milo and his insane misunderstanding of other people. No one ever said everyone MUST be fat or must NOT lose weight, no one in their right mind acts that way. Even fat acceptance advocates like myself.  As for health... well, as a fat acceptance advocate who is RATIONAL for once, I'd say that  there is nuance there too. Hey, and I'm SJW trash like you, ContraPoints, so let's be friends! But, regardless of that, health and risks are important to consider, but people don't understand that some people take pleasure or happiness from being fat. They don't want to change because it is their identity and integrity as a unique individual. Yeah yeah yeah, blah blah blah, special snowflakes and all that. But it's important for people to feel special, and people are tired of being told or almost forced to fall into line. They want to exercise each day, but still eat well, and do their best to be healthy WITHOUT weight loss. Why is that such a bad thing? What happened to freedom of choice and lifestyle? Also, if someone wants to lose weight, they are very much free to do so, but it's almost projection when people shower their insecurities and fears about getting fat onto other people who already are fat. Then claim to understand what THEIR experience is. I am almost 300 lbs and I am hardly immobile or super unhealthy. I exercise every day, I started taking fiber, and eating more fruit or healthy snacks such as Yogurt. But I DO NOT want to lose weight because I love my body. Why is that such a bad awful thing? If it has some risks attached to it, then so what? So many things have risks attached to them, but are choices as well, and you can argue that people do these things as jobs and have no choice. But what about using wingsuits, which are insanely dangerous extreme sports? Or playing football, which has resulted in countless bodily injury. These are STILL choices, so why is being fat magically signaled out? The double standards are mind boggling. Sure, this might be a false equivelancy, but if you do any research, there's a huge community of fat men and fat women who admire eachother's bodies on the Internet, then make money showing it off as their job as well.  So yeah, these stupid anti-SJWs can't make that argument anymore that people choose dangerous lives because it is their job. Also, pleasure and happiness are things that matter too, but apparently you must live a joyless life falling in line because 'science and evidence' says so. Isn't that, you know, totalitarian? I know science is inherently dogmatic, but there is nuance to studies saying being fat is unhealthy. Observe this essay, which I copied and pasted from somewhere:   URL  Type 2 Diabetes is the only real link that has been found, and even then there isn't that many 'obese' people who get it anyway. Also, confounding factors such as exercise levels, diet, happiness levels, age, and access to healthcare affect the data. But for some reason, those things don't matter.  In the end, I hate Milo and the rest of these crazy reactionaries for their constant fat hate. They refuse to understand those of us who love to live on the larger side of life. They think we struggle constantly with pain due to our weight when that's simply not true. Yeah, maybe I shouldn't speak for all fat people, but I certainly feel great and can move perfectly fine. Also, I am very tall, almost 5'12'', so I am not exactly THAT fat. XD","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"So in my quest as an anti-SJW to go through your backlog of videos, I have chosen this as my next experience. As always the skit bits are hilarious and I love them and want them framed (idk how it'd work, but we'll make it work) I totally agree with you that fat-shaming at least borders on, if not being outright, bullying. It's not necessary, and while it make work in SOME cases, it seems to often do more harm than good. Now what I can not get behind is the idea that we should just accept obesity. And i'm saying this as someone who is somewhere between overweight and obese. There are a myriad of health problems that come with being overweight and obese, and we really shouldn't encourage people to live in a way that is unhealthy for them. We don't encourage people to be alcoholics, or to smoke constantly. We don't bully and shame them either, to be fair. Even if there are factors other than just a lack of self control and discipline that goes into obesity, there is also mountains of proof that you can lose weight and keep it off if you work hard enough and make smart eating choices. That does NOT mean you'll look like a model, but you will be healthy and avoid weight-related health complications. And regardless of how hard it is to get healthy, I cannot get behind simply accepting fatness because it's hard to keep it in check.  Now I do agree that not everyone is a model, and the 'beauty standard' for women AND men is pretty unattainable. We should celebrate a diverse set of body types, and you can be healthy without being a 120 pound stickman (or stickwoman as the case may be) Overall I loved the video and I can't wait to look into more of your work! :D","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I'd rather be 20 pounds heavier than I am now than 20 pounds lighter. Being healthy and exercising really is your best bet.

The typical fat harassment I've seen directed at men and women tends to be vastly more passive aggressive. The kinds of things people say behind their hands and through one side of their mouths. Milo and blair are playing these things up for comedy, not because they actually think them.   Not that that makes them good role models, but I'm trying to point out that ultimately i don't think they ARE role models. People don't emulate them, they idolize them.  As for being healthy not being a moral position: the issue i take with this can be summed up in one word: Obamacare. If I'm living in a country that wants to make health available to all and more accessible to all, how can i also live in a country that puts special emphasis on soft pedaling the virtues of health? How can i view people being left in unhealthy squalor as a moral wrong if health itself is neither moral nor immoral?

It's just that there's variation in metablolism, energy expenditure, satiation, and other factors that are out of peoples control.

"@5:21 you say it's a lot more complicated than calories in and calories out. I disagree, it really is as simple as that. The complicated part is that is comes down to mental state and lifestyle. Some people love to eat, hate to exercise and have sedentary lives, for these people avoiding obesity will be extremely difficult. Some people don't care for food and are active; these people will almost certainly not be obese.  Whether fat shaming works probably depends on the individual being shamed. For some it could be a catalyst to do something about their weight for others it could have the opposite effect and push them in to a sad state and comfort eating.  On the flip side of that I feel that fat acceptance can be truly harmful. I'm sure we've all seen these morbidly obese individuals standing up on stage and telling their audience that they are happy and loving their size is not only sending a bad message but is probably not even true.  As question for you ContraPoints; do you find obese people sexually attractive? You talk about changing our cultural views of attractiveness to include the obese  but you can't change what people find sexually appealing any more than you can change their preferred gender, race of even species.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Well constructed video, I liked. But I would like to question what you say in part 3: fat acceptance. (It is going to be quite long, sorry about that... thank you very much to anybody who will read the entire thing).  First of all, let's clarify something: I hate fat. Not fat people: my loath is only directed toward that yellow thing and the moral burden it embodies. And I know that my desire to stay the healthiest possible and thus in shape (not skinny, in shape) comes from a very subjective set of moral and philosophical principles (the behavioral tags I chose...and vanity is also to blame...). I just wanted to make that bias clear before starting.  So my main issue concerns your point about the 'moralizing edge to the idea of health'. Of course, and I totally agree with you on that principle, it is not 'inherently virtuous to be healthy' (there is no such thing as Universal Virtue anyway) but in a society that aims to implement a truly fonctional healthcare system, a national responsibility is to be waited from each individuals (to go further: metabo law in Japan). Because of the material (money, infrastructures...) and human consequences of a certain type of behavior: your liberty ceases where my liberty begins. And if the egoistic decisions you take are dangerous to the equilibrium of society (considering that the majority agrees with this type of equilibrium) then the expected outcome is to see yourself being dismissed or ostracized. However, I do believe that everything is a question of structure, we are all rolling stones in the river (Spinoza, my love) and we shouldn't put all the blame on the responsibility of obese people towards food.  - First there is 'environmental structure': part of it is the fact that it is way easier and cheaper to buy junk food in the USA than it is in France for example. In France you can buy your vegetables for a reasonable price at supermarkets or 'open air markets' (both cases tested)... fresh food was much more expensive in the USA...(=>Income inequalities related obesity) The problem is multiple in fact, from urban design (too many fast food restaurants, not enough supermarkets), to the food industry, wealth inequalities, antibiotics... - Then there is 'mental structure': victimization is a cancer because it bears the germ of resignation. And this state of mind comes from the general passiveness that seem to be commonly widespread today...I hope that's just my feeling though.  But let's come back to Fat acceptance: Loving yourself, yes, but in order to strive to become better. I am not saying that skinny is superior to fat (superior in terms of what ?), I am saying that to live as fully as possible, there is nothing better than feeling the burning flame of that desire to surpass themselves (well that's what I believe). And thus do what is possible to maintain the full capacities of one's body.  And finally, I have some (ethical and moral) issues with the idea of viewing fatness as a celebration of excess and thus as something positive (especially from the 'biological beauty/best offspring-related choice' point of view)... but this paragraph is getting too long :)  Sorry again for the length... Love :)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'All that critique can do is sketch the bars of your own prison' I'm stealing that. Also I'm not in agreement with this one, mostly because of the irreversible nature of fatness. Even if you feel like being fat is more to your likeness for whatever reason, you may not feel that way forever. I believe a great part of fat people want to be thin, and mostly because of health reasons.  May be just me, and I'm not the healthiest of all, but I just can't picture someone being comfortable with something that actively makes your life worse. Obesity is complexity artificial, human fabricated, outside the common natural spectrum. Humans are likely the only creature you're gonna meet in your life that can far exceed the average weight of the species. By the alone, it shows how evolution didn't prepare us for such a condition. With that said, I don't condemn the people who feel like staying that way, but biggest trouble is their health problems and regret :/","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

We are to a large extent products of our environment. For that reason we cannot just let everyone be fat because it leads to future generations doing the same thing and also becoming fat. The libertarian do whatever you want attitude assumes you don't affect other people much with your existance and living but you do. Just letting others be self-destructive is not kindness. It's quite the opposite.  If I raise my children in an environment where 70% are obese versus one where 5% are obese (like in earlier times), they'll be a lot more likely to become obese in the first environment. We are humans, monkey see, monkey do.  The social environment in the first scenario would be all geared up with tons of fast food places with extra large sodas while the environment in the latter case will have few of them. In the first you will have a very inactive population to imitate and the second may have a more active one.  And if they are a lot more likely to become obese, everything from depression to health problems to very inactive lifestyles and unhappiness follows.  Not something you'd want for your kids right?

Fat-acceptance would be either praise or surrender to the fact that you are enjoying pleasures in life to the point that they are no longer pleasurable.

It's everyone's business because a nation of unhealthy people inflates health insurance premiums immensely for everyone, and diverts work and resources which could go to other publicly beneficial projects.  I also believe it contributes to the irritability of the population, which although is an extremely hard thing to measure the effects of, probably makes life less pleasant in many ways.

"1. I will never use the 'just trolling' defense. If you are fat, you're fat. Your feelings are not my problem and I'm not going to be shamed by anyone for speaking the truth.  2. I have no pretenses of concern for fat people - I just hate having to look at them. Simple.  3. I have no problem being a bad person. I _am_ a bad person. I'm okay with that. At least I'm not fat.  4. Is our obsession with health driving us to madness? What you should be asking yourself is: 'Are we sacrificing physical health for mental health with all this Fat Acceptance crap?' (Protip: Yes)  5. Yes, calories do behave differently depending on what kind of calories you're eating - but that doesn't mean you had to eat the calories to begin with.  6. The concept that you should 'just stop trying to lose weight because it will never work' is just plain defeatist and idiotic. But if you're content with dying earlier and suffering a greater loss of quality of life, too, who am I to argue?  7. Unfortunately, the concept of morality is every bit as subjective as the concept of your favorite brand of soda. But morality has very little to do with pragmatic fact. When a doctor is giving you advice, that advice is based on the most pragmatic brand of science available at the time. Once again, you choose to ignore that at your own peril.  8. The culturally accepted norm of beauty/sexiness is based off of biological urges and drives that we humans have been imbued with over thousands of years. Trying to deny those urges and drives is like trying to mutate a part of your body without any of the others being affected - it simply won't work (PS. those same norms and standards are the same ones that dictate the aversion that people feel toward transgenders which is the reason why _NOBODY WANTS TO SEE YOU DANCING AROUND IN A LEOTARD, BRO_).  9. When you're talking about a 'symbolic transformation of the meaning of fatness', it sounds an awful lot to me like you're going dangerously close into thought-policing territory - at the very least, you're talking about serious social engineering. Exactly what authority, moral or otherwise, do you and people like you have to make those kinds of changes to the human race (especially when you're in the _minority_)?  10. This 'lingering anxiety' you describe? That's called 'fear'. You know why fear exists? To keep you from making very poor decisions. Vertigo exists to keep you from falling to your death. Arachnophobia exists to keep you from dying from a Funnel Web spider bite. And 'Fatphobia' exists because there is a part of your brain that inherently understands that getting fat is a bad thing. 'Conquering' these fears doesn't necessarily make you 'brave' or 'strong' - it just means you've retarded an instinct that was otherwise meant to be used for self-preservation.

"They talk about 'tough love' and 'concern' when fat-shaming actually contributes to anorexic mindsets and leads people to starve themselves. They claim to be promoting a healthy lifestyle when they're being abusive assholes when they're inadvertently promoting and causing anorexic tendencies, especially when they talk about the 'self-control' concept. If you look into the science and the psychology of anorexia, you will quickly be able to connect it by statements made by fat shamers. (Don't argue with me about this. I study psychology and have anorexia. I know what I'm talking about and I will crush you, any stinkers who might be reading.)  These are the same sorts of people who will encourage overweight people who starve themselves to continue starving themselves, even though they're doing irreversible damage to their body that could quite literally kill them. So no, it's not about health. They callously ignore things that could contribute to obesity, such as anxiety, depression, hypothyroidism, ovarian cysts, hormonal imbalances, poverty, erratic sleep patterns, insomnia, certain medications, stress, eating disorders, traumatic experiences, PTSD, etc.   I shouldn't be surprised, though.

"Although I don't usually agree with you on many things (I'm a subscriber because I find your videos entertaining and to listen to a different point of view so I don't live in an echo chamber), I do agree with this video a lot.  One thing that the anti-fat-positivity people fail to understand is that, like you said, there are MANY, MANY factors that make people fat. There's the whole sugar industry conspiracy that was a big contributor to the obesity epidemic and other things like diseases, genetics, mental health etc. As someone who's somewhat fat not because I have some sort of disease like Hypothyroidism and who's lost a lot of weight in the past and have put everything on again, I can tell you that losing weight isn't easy, it's VERY, VERY hard. It requires A LOT of discipline and motivation. Especially when food with high concentration of fat and sugar is so widely available and cheap. Add depression to the mix and then you have a recipe for disaster. It's really hard not to eat or drink when you are depressed as those are two of the few things that bring some sort of pleasure or make you forget about things. Because of all of that I'm against fat-shaming and the whole tough-love thing.  I just have a few problems with the fat acceptance movement. One is that it makes it seem like that being fat is healthy when it's not. I've seen people in the movement claiming that doctors are lying when they say that obesity increase your risk factors, it isn't healthy and when they say that they are fat-shaming. NO, being fat isn't healthy and I know I'm not healthy. You should like yourself for what you are, but knowing that you body isn't in a healthy state (even if you have low cholesterol and a good diet) and know the dangers being fat brings. We should fight the obesity epidemic not because it's not attractive, but because obesity is dangerous while of course accepting people for who they are. There are many ways to do that, including educating people about what types of food or habits are healthy.  Another problem I have with it is that the movement is too focused on women to the point that many of them don't give a shit about fat men. You could argue that women have more expectations from society when it comes to image, I'll grant you that, but men are seen as lazy and dirty when they are fat as much as women and I've seen many, many men who struggle with body image as well and are told to suck it up.  Also some people in the movement (and I have to emphasize here that it's not everyone) sound like they are saying that women shouldn't accept that some men won't feel attracted to them because they are fat and that those men should be ashamed of themselves for being so superficial but with fat guys it's a different story. I've been rejected many times for superficial reasons and I do understand and accept that not everyone will be be attracted to me and they don't have to, and those people have to understand that women should accept that's gonna happen to them too.  I don't know, this is basically my view, feel free to disagree or whatever.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Nick,  I agree with you that there are lots of factors that cause obesity, but we can't ignore that to a large extent it is about calories in calories out.  I totally understand that addictions are more than just weakness of the will, but the only way to lose weight is for your body to burn more calories than it consumes (as a tobacco user I know all to well how hard it is to break a habit, but at least using tobacco people don't have all these terrible assumptions about you, or at least its not that bad).  Are Milo and the crew being overly simplistic? Absolutely, but you keep citing the weight loss industry and you never even pointed out that the weight loss industry NEVER emphasizes the point that its about calories in calories out. Its always some fad, be it diet or work out, and trying to sell a bunch of stimulants to 'aid in weight loss.'  The reality is that the 'weight loss' industry is inherently bad because they've marketed weight loss as a product to buy and not something to work toward.  I'm not fat, I have family members who are. It sucks man. It really does, the way they're treated, the way they feel about themselves, it really does suck. But it really is about giving people the necessary tools to be able to make the right decisions to themselves. That does include telling people to avoid unhealthy eating habits, but it also includes keeping people accountable and finding ways to keep them motivated to lose the weight. Its not an easy thing.  And while I know you made this video to criticize Milo's absurd remarks, and you lament about how if you ignore him then you're 'letting his shit pass' and if you take him seriously you've been trolled. Well I got a solution to that; how about actually talk about how the weight loss industry is actually bad and takes advantage of people who are trying to desperately lose weight.  Milo saying hurtful things is bad, but its not nearly as bad as the people who take advantage of people in a really poor state. Maybe you could actually make videos calling out that sort of thing; however, and I mean this as no offense, that wouldn't be nearly as entertaining or healthy to your subscriber count.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This video is a really useful introduction to the reasoning behind fat acceptance. I had a brief run-in with morbid obesity myself due to poor diet habits. Topped out at 241 lbs in 2015. As it stands right now I've managed to stick around the 205 lb mark. I credit that to working full time in a manual labor job.  I also appreciate that most people won't be able to replicate my success in losing weight and keeping it off. So I say, regardless of whether you are thin or thick, just eat when you're hungry, sleep when you're tired, avoid heavily processed foods as much as you can, and try to stay away from things with a lot of sugar in it. Do all that, and your weight won't matter as much.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Juxtaposing yourself against a bunch of ass hats doesn't make what you have to say next any more true. So let's set aside the deliberately outrageous provocateurs and see if what you're saying makes any sense in its own right.  Your last point speaks against your thesis. You've spent the whole video saying, in effect, people are gonna be what they're gonna be, so let's just accept it and celebrate it. But then you admit that you feel the desire to be thin, based on vanity. Vanity is generally frowned upon. But it's a natural human impulse. Why not direct it towards a pro social outcome? We could probably agree that vanity should be diminished. And thus we can dismiss the bullies who revel in vanity and thus encourage it. But I don't think it's feasible to think that we can remove vanity from the human experience.  If we're stuck with vanity, why not channel it towards a healthy body? We're fat as a population. And that's a real health problem. But at lest we don't want to be. Claiming that we should just accept being fat seems like throwing in the towel. It's sour grapes. Ceasing to want something (health) because we've found that we can't get it. Because whatever we do to try and address being fat, it doesn't work.  I would rather look for something that does work, than just accept the miserable state of things as they are. That celebration seems hollow.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It's not until it starts attacking peole over their sexual preference, denying the very real health risks that come with obesity (or even moderate fatness), or demanding unreasonable forms of special treatment that I start take a hardline stance against what calls itself 'body positivity' (yet more closely resembles bitter and insecure fat people lashing out at 'skinny bitches').","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I've called people 'fat bitch' before, but purely for one reason: To hurt their feelings. Now, I've called non-fat people mean stuff, too and for exactly the same reason.

"I can't really get into the body positivity part of it all, but definitely agree about the pointlessness of the shaming. Guess I'm body neutral.  It's ok to not want to be fat. There are reasons besides shame from others for that, which only reinforces how pointless the shaming is. They shame people who are already big enough to experience the natural consequences of fatness (mobility, spatial constraints, loss of conventional attractiveness, physiological side effects). It's like teasing a smoker for having emphysema. If you really are going to bully people for their own good, shouldn't it be done before the point of disease?

"There's of course the idea that fat = bad is a new one.   Before the 20th century, fatness was associated with wealth, decadence and higher social class, because only wealthy people had the income and means to not work and consume large amounts of food. Due to industrial farming revolution and now the hyper-prevalence of junk food in poor communities, getting fat is now easy! So, being skinny is now associated with higher social class because people with means now have the ability to eat healthier, non-caloric foods and have a lifestyle which has the time and means to exercise.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Well, I can't speak for every 'shitlord' out there, but most people I know have no interest in policing anyone's behavior, or think anybody should feel ashamed for being the way they are. So yes, it IS trolling, even if that's no excuse. But you''re ignoring the fact that when making videos like that, people are in part responding to, I guess I could say, a ''culture' that claims those who don't feel attraction to certain body types are bigots, or calls thin women 'not real' and so on and so forth...  And it's like you said, some people will not feel too inclined to stop doing something when they're shamed for it; quite the opposite. That's why I think is important to keep a balanced outlook on these matters, because otherwise it's like a shitty game of telephone, where the next person that talks about the issue, just adds to it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think it's a reactionary social issue due to the fat-acceptance movement to have a 'fat shaming' movement. Because let's be honest, most of both sides are just slinging shit at each other either way. Fat acceptance is more about pretending you are attractive to everyone and a victim, while fat-shaming is explicitly the opposite.   As long as you have people who actually want to work out, fat acceptance will never catch on.  And given the ridiculous amount of complications that come with obesity(not fat, obese), it's also not reasonable for society to even come to the conclusion of promoting it.(it'd be like promoting smoking).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I don't support fatshaming, and it definitely doesn't help, but I don't support the sentiments of a few in the extreme body positive crowd, who ignore obesity as a problem all together.

"Although I agree with your main premise that fat shaming is both immoral and counterproductive from a public health standpoint, I disagree with your statement that obesity should be celebrated as a symbol of glorious excess.  This idea dishonestly represents the distribution of obesity within developed countries, and ignores the disease burden that our society saddles on low-income people.  Within developed countries, obesity does not represent access to calories.  Rather, it represents a LACK of access to healthy foods, places to conveniently and safely exercise, and critically, a lack of leisure time with which to prepare food at home and exercise.  As a result, obese people are disproportionately poor and live in poor neighborhoods.  Low-income people disproportionately suffer from obesity-related diseases such as heart disease and diabetes, and simultaneously lack the resources to effectively treat them.  This is a critical social justice issue that should not be ignored in the name of body positivity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I was wondering if you were planning to address the counter of the 'fat shaming' people, that is, the side of the fat acceptance movement that goes into outright denial of obesity as a physical health problem.  It is a health problem, and while it does have significant environmental and genetic causes, that does not mean that we can't or shouldn't do anything about it at the social or policy level.  For instance, the obesity epidemic is driven in large part by the fact that many people simply do not have the financial means to buy healthy food. That means that an entire social class of people is forced into having the long-term health problems and lower overall quality of life that come with being obese.  It's not as if obese people are making the choice to be obese, clearly given the choice they would not actually want to be, nor would they want their children to be, but they are simply not being given the option to not be obese.  That is something that we can solve without shaming anyone.  It's just like any other disease.

"Ok, question, is it ever ok or at least tolerable to insult people? Or as some might call it, bully people? Say I'd call Trump a 'sorry orange excuse of a murkin?'  Would that be bad? Should I be called out? Would we need a Hashtag? #StopOrangeShaming2016 ? I mean there is currently probably more orange shaming going around on Twitter, Facebook, etc. than fat shaming. #OrangePeopleUnite! But they won't unite. Why? Because it's too shameful to come out as orange! OMG, it's worse than we thought!  Or to bring it a little closer to home: Anorexia shaming is a real thing. These people even face real life oppression, like the ban of super skinny models because they supposedly are bad role models for little girls. But obesity is a much bigger health issue than anorexia and yet we want more fat role models! The model suffering from anorexia on the other hand is not only risking her life but now also without a job.  Let me quote Elanor Rosevelt here: 'No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.' Instead of making up stupid and complex rules regarding who can say what im which situation that might or might not shame anyone, let's all just grow a backbone, shall we? If someone tries to insult me by pointing towards something about me that has fuck all to do with anything, I just laugh at their stupidity and don't try to play the victim.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think you're right that people are often too quick to judge fat people as lazy. But when you say things like, 'individuals do have some control over their weight', I think you're going a bit far in the other direction. Let's be honest, people have full control in losing weight if they choose to. And doing so would be beneficial to society.  A 'celebration of excess' seems so stupid to me. Would we have a celebration of people suffering a drug or alcohol addiction? What about a celebration of depression? We recognise that although these situations might not be as simple to fix as calling someone stupid or lazy, they're certainly not ideal and we shouldn't accept it.  I think there should be more help for people with all these issues. I'm not so sure about the USA, but in the UK obesity is a huge issue for the NHS. The more obese people we have in society the more people we have not paying taxes, while also taking more out of the health service. I think being understanding but firm as a society is a sensible position.  Also, at the end of your video you mention you want to look healthy. Why do you think that is? When I was 20 I used to be addicted to fitness and exercise, and a huge driver in that was because I wanted to be accepted. I had the opposite problem, people calling me too skinny, but if I was accepted for that I probably wouldn't be a healthier weight now. And perhaps you wouldn't want to look healthy either? Can you see how not completely accepting obesity without being a dickhead isn't such as awful thing?

"I don't agree with the idea of shaming somebody for being fat, but I would definitely be honest to somebody close to me (family, etc.) if I think their weight is getting out of hand. I wouldn't be mean about it and would try to help them. I want them to stick around for a while as opposed to dying younger. I also don't agree with fat acceptance. You run into the issue of fat people costing a hell of a lot of money in the healthcare system. I go more into this later in this comment.  3:45 'What causes obesity?' Consuming significantly more calories than you burn. It's literally just that. If you think otherwise, you would have to break the laws of physics.  3:52 'How hard is it to lose weight and keep it off?' From what I've seen, if you go with some temporary diet trash, it's nearly impossible to keep it off. If you know what you consume, then not only is it easy to lose, but it's also easy to keep off. By 'know what you consume,' I'm talking about nutrition facts of the foods.  4:00 'Is our collective obsession with losing weight driving us into the realm of madness?' I don't think it's an obsession for most. The truly obsessed would be those with eating disorders or the likes. There are more obese people than ever. The reasons WHY there are more obese people isn't relevant to know that there exists a problem.  Ok...  6:15 'So the proposal that socially reinforced self-loathing is the best solution to obesity is as stupid as it is immoral.' 6:55 'If you eat well and exercise, that's really the most you can be expected to do, whatever your weight, but in my opinion, even this view of things sometimes gives a little too sharp a moralizing edge to the idea of health.' In MY opinion, you were moralizing quite a bit with the first one. In contrast, I don't see how 'If you eat well and exercise, that's really the most you can be expected to do, whatever your weight...' is a moral argument in any way.  8:13 'I don't think that it's really any of my business to tell people that they should be healthy.' To some extent, I would argue that it is my business. This leads back to the healthcare argument. This may not apply to EVERY person, but as far as I can tell, it applies to most. Unless they just die quickly and easily, many of them will cost quite a bit of money for something that is completely preventable.

"I think the point the 'trolls' are trying to make is that displaying awful ideas publicly isn't an attempt to provoke a rational counterargument, but is rather intended to draw out people who use violence or legislated censorship as a means to win an argument, and provoke them to openly make an ass of themselves by doing so - that is, when it is 'trolling' and not someone's actual opinion. An atmosphere of open controversy is supposed to make us think about how we go about 'winning' arguments. I mean, Contra poking fun at trolls is hilarious but it isn't actually in line with the Socratic method,which involves a dialogue in which questions are raised to discover an opponents premises, exposing them as true or false. Nor does it particularly invested in parallel debate, where outcome is set aside in favor of obtaining the maximum amount of information before deciding upon a correct conclusion. So oddly enough the bit where the shamers criticize others for criticizing them is actually a valid concern. Arguments aren't 'won' simply by exposing their conclusions as false. They are won by forming and promoting counterarguments which use new premises and syllogisms to suggest a conclusion which is actually true. Contra does this with data, and that's the actual counterargument. It would be a mistake to view the critique of the trolls as at all relevant to the outcome of the debate.  I mean it's funny, but it isn't an argument and shouldn't be viewed as such by trolls or anyone else.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Great video as usual. I agree with all of your points, but would like to add one consideration. In a system with a socialized health care system trying to be healthy could be somewhat relevant. Just like the state would have to guarantee adequate care, each individual should ideally try to not unnecessarily strain their health. You can hardly force them / micromanage their lifes and I'm not advocating for that at all, but it could be considered virtuos if the individual decides to help and reduce costs as much as possible.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"While you made some decent points against fat shaming you still haven't made any reasonable defense of 'fat acceptance' which at the end of the day is a dangerous and to be totally honest .... stupid movement.  In an age of rampant obesity which is tied to numerous health problems which in turn creates numerous economic problems the last thing we need is a movement which promotes obesity. Sure, insulting fat people doesn't work but a there are many other methods that do. And for the love of all things holy and unholy, stop using moronic professional victims like Lindy West as a source. Thumbs down from me. Best Wishes","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I'd say that you don't need to be bitter about Blair because your content is better and that views matter less than truth and beauty, but no human bitterness has ever been assuaged that easily. I might even go so far as to say that human bitterness is a perpetual motion machine, unstoppable once in motion. Maybe one day, we will harness human bitterness to generate electricity for a brighter future, and it will all have been thanks to people with undeserved success. It's all so clear now.

"I can understand milo being a villian because he is a attention seeking psychopath but Blaire white? lol. It's true though people that push fat acceptance are evil and want to virtue signal and don't care about the health of others,i know friends that personally believe anyone that thinks someone as disgusting as tess holiday is unhealthy they lose their shit and claim if they don't date someone that fat they are a bigot, these people have turned bitter and bratty. I know not all fat people are like that because they are lazy and eat like shit but even i had a friend who apparently got fat because of her epilepsy meds, but she would eat an entire box of biscuits as a snack which would not help.lance that is needed not bullying fat people to a point to hate themselves but also not celebrating it like its a ok thing and 'healthy at any size'. There is a balance needed People tend to eat out of sadness thus pushing that sadness won't help all the time but then again a lot of fat people are gormless lazy gluttons and I've known enough personal.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Another really great video. I especially appreciate the last part and how honest you were. I am definitely in a similar situation where I feel that self love/acceptance is very important and try to encourage it whenever possible but I also have had issues with my own body, especially where at one point I had lost a bunch of weight and now have regained some of it. It's not always easy to practice what you preach, especially in a world where you have people constantly trying to tear you down for doing so. It's so strange to me though that there are people obsessed with making others hate themselves. I genuinely can't tell if they have nothing better to do, are really invested with proving something or just hate themselves so much that they need others to do so too (maybe it's a mixture of all three).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Drinking and smoking obviously have this same affect, but I believe that the paranoia of 'am I getting screwed by paying more than I'd need to because these people are less healthy than me' is overall one of the biggest hurdles for socialized medicine to clear.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
