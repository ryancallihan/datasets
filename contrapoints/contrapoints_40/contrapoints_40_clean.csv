If capitalism is bound to dire ends, then to bring that about we shouldn't try to stop capitalism because by doing that we're just delaying its end.

"One of the main problems with capitalism is that it centralizes financial. One of the main problems with getting rid of capitalism is that humans, like always, will find other ways to consolidate power and create hierarchies. Except most other types of hierarchies, like those under feudalism, tend to be even more rigid and inflexible. The solution is to better distribute that power within a society, so that inequality is much less.   The gini coefficient is all about measuring this.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The worst thing about the modern capitalist economy is that hard work and productivity do not lead to significantly higher earnings.  At one of my jobs, the head cashiers are paid 19% more than almost everyone else. But between 9 and 12 of the 16-18 total cashiers are paid the exact same wage. If I'm not fired, there is no reason for me to put in any extra effort at all. That really is a rigged economy. A person should not have to live far from their work, in the second crappiest apartment available at the end of June, with no savings and no legitimate short/medium promotion possibilities. There is an argument that people who can do more than check (I'm not planning on working min wage my whole life or something myself) should go to college, but then it makes no sense why college should be so expensive. If the goal is a productive society then college should be free/low cost. If the goal is happiness, jobs should pay more and more jobs would be involved in real needs instead of accessories The economy works for neither. It works to ensure that a few people stay wealthy no matter who suffers.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"To start. What is the capitalism you are talking about? What do you mean by that?  When I hear the word 'capitalism' I have the same question of its nature as when I hear the word 'god'. Do you think I should 'know' the word 'somehow', because Marx once said somewhere what is the capitalism? Did he define that? If that is what Marx have defined, then Marx have defined some very, very bad thing we should avoid at all costs (meaning, we should avoid using the definition, because it is evil) Now we know that we do not use Marx's definition. Then what else can capitalism be? Obviously, 'not socialism', as Marx have invented the word to create socialism propaganda.   Now, when we have something that is not something else, that something couldn't possibly be guilty of every of society's faults. It is also 'guilty' of every of society's successes as well. It is a natural order of things, which is chaos, and in chaos, what you build works how you've built it - but only for a time, after which it brokes and dissolves into basic components, from many of which consists chaos.   If you've said that our economic system is an ineffective economic system which is bad at distribution of resources - I would've agreed. Justs its not capitalism. Our economic system is bad because it is *economic* system. To be good it should be *spending* system.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Also, even from a profit-driven point of view. The way we distribute income, almost equally makes no sense.

Yet, since not many people have internet let alone a Kindle, there's no purchases.   I'm going to one up you then and say that capitalism is flawed because it priorities *short term gains* over *long term gains*. That's why no-ones doing shit all about climate change, while having all your shops drown in the long term is probably bad and would effect business, in the short term its best not to give a shit and buy more cheap oil power.

"This is great. Some suggestions about the way you end it: 1. Everyone, read George Bernard Shaw's 'The Thinking Woman's Guide to Socialism, Capitalism, Sovietism and Fascism'. Lots of helpful ideas there.  2. We make the big online retailers, social media and portals (Amazon, Youtube, Facebook) and the big real world 3D retailers (Walmart, IKEA, etc.) into consortium owned by all their suppliers. That is, if you sell $100 of goods you produced on Amazon, or made  for IKEA to sell, or brought in that amount of ads or worth in postings on Youtube or Facebook, you now own the equivalent in voting shares of that company. Same with Uber drivers etc. So these become instruments of those doing the work, instead of their exploiters. 3. We nationalize a few key things like banks and hedge funds, energy, etc. 4. Green New Deal with Full Employment and public health care etc. 5. A new Bretton Woods (look it up) where the leading countries agree to capital controls to end finance's and investors' ability to move at will around the world and play countries off against each other. 6. Money created ONLY by governments through the now public banks by grants to municipalities and worker-owned cooperatives. Family-size private businesses to remain, big companies converted into being democratically owned and run by all stakeholders. This is not yet quite socialism, but it would no longer be capitalism and would create all the preconditions to create a better system for happiness - and thanks for reminding us that happiness is the point in this video. How to achieve it? We coordinate electoral projects in  every country but back these up with movements ready to do what worked in South Africa, and all nonviolent revolutions: make the country ungovernable (general strikes, occupations etc.). When we gain power locally the city turns resources over to neighborhood assemblies and worker cooperatives. When we win nationally we do the big stuff. That's my suggestion.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You avoid two things.  1)  Communist socialism (ideally) rewards workers equally leading to a downward spiral of performance.  The goal for a worker becomes to get away with doing as little as possible relative to how little work another worker is getting away with doing thus maximizing their pay relative to the amount of work that they do.  2)  Every bad aspect of capitalism can be mitigated by governance.  If governance was thoroughly insulated from capitalist influence so that the interest of the public could always supersede the interests of capitalists, there would be much less disparity, maybe even very little disparity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hello, great video. However you left out one of the most important aspects of economic systems: Taxes. I'd appreciate it if you could include this topic when you feel like making a video about the economy again. Thank you.   Taxes: how do they currently work, how did they come to be, what they could be for the human species.   I think that separating people in groups 'bourgeois' and others is a mistake because it makes things out of humans. Taxes are for everyone, except the queen. So if we could talk about taxes we could find a way to be all in the same boat, though some may row in different directions, if most of us agree on what we want taxes to be we could go beyond separating people in groups.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Isn't there a simpler way to describe how capitalism doesn't work for the benefit of most of the people?  Something like this:  In feudalism, private land ownership was a tool for the feudal landowner to make money and not the peasant.  There is a finite amount of land and the peasants will never get any of it.  Capital is like land in that it is finite today and is all privately owned.  But capital is unlike land because it is 'increaseable' with the injection of labor or new technology.  But the laborers will only get the market wage for their work, whereas most of the new increase in capital (production) will go to the owners of capital, just like it did under feudalism.   So capitalism may increase the overall production of things, but can only further increase the inequality that already exists.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hello, back from the other video. You asked to provide reasons for why capitalism isnt bad. Some others have made similar points but I'll go ahead and make them now. While I agree with your criticisms of capitalist society and think it is very important to look at, I think that you fell into the same trap Marx did when writing his book on economic theory. The fact is, as you admit, you do not understand how the economic system works. Which is good that you recognize it, however, I think it is troubling to say you dont understand how it works but then suggest that it should change.  As I said in the last video, I think the major problem comes in when we ascribe some sense of morality to capitalism. The fact is capitalism does not care about morality. It is an objective way in which a system works. I think it is important to understand what the free market is and the invisible hand that guides it. The fact is that capitalism is far better at predicting trends in consumer behavior and innovation. Jobs and specializations for jobs are created because there are opportunities discovered by individuals. Or innovations are made because big business constantly pushes research and development to find new things that none of us ever knew we wanted before.   While I understand you are against a Maoist or Stalinist system I think it is important to understand just how much innovation was made under capitalism and still is being made. All of this creates new jobs and creates new wealth and opportunities. If, as you say, we redistribute the wealth, where does that money go? Well, it will likely go into businesses like Mcdonalds or Amazon. It does not create more wealth, it simply recycles it. This, in turn, means businesses and wealthy people are more hesitant to invest their wealth into research which in turn creates less real wealth.  This isnt to say that redistributing wealth would not help the poorer people. But this would only be helpful in the short run. If you look at the long run you will notice that it will actually hurt the economy overall. The fact is that we live in a world where money is still something that is needed. We can go on a debate about what currency is but that is not what I am looking at in my rebuttel. I only care about objectivity, which is what capitalism is, objectivity.  Another important facet of my argument is to understand the two popular forms of capitalism, that being kaynsian and Hayek. Kaynsian is the popular version which suggests that governments spend money in order to jump start the economy. This was brought about because of the great depression in order to solve the problem of the boom and bust cycle. It is effective in places like Taiwan or the US, however, in the long run it is bad for the economy because it creates crony capitalism. Hayek believes in a free market system which I have talked about above which is the one I am for.  Anyway, I'll leave it at that. TL;DR: I think it is important to study how the economy works. We can agree on philosophy but economics is an objective measure and science, not an art. So I think it is important to understand how it works before suggesting regime change.  Also, good video, I enjoyed it. But this was the major problem with you argument I found.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"so... I mean, pretty much everything you addressed in these two parts can be handled by federal government regulations on our current form of capitalism. And it's not that we are currently un-regulated, just that we have to vote the right people into office who really understand how the economy works- and that hasn't been happening. I mean- this is pretty much how Trump won 2016. Promising the working class people that he is going to bring their jobs back to the country, among other things. Capitalism overall is a pretty good system- and our version of it allows for social mobility. If you were born with poor parents, you could invent something- or write a book- or pursue the job you want to have in order to live comfortably. One of the issues- college debt- isn't necessarily because of capitalism, it has grown out of a cultural stigma against being in a tradeskill type job- like a carpenter or a plumber (who make liveable wages) and social pressure that one 'can't be successful if they don't go to college' which is a false premise. One doesn't *need* college to be successful. Anyway- I just heard your name come up on WBEZ chicago radio and decided to look up some old videos. Nice work with the criticism, and good on you to avoid advocating for an overly dramatic shift in the economy! And I agree with some points, and hopefully we can fix the broken systems that allow for big corporate entities to have control over the majority of assets.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think this was an excellent  video and brought up some really interesting points. I'd like to address a few things you touched on  Income inequity has more to do with how much money you can make your employer (eg. How valuable you are to the company you work for) and/or how easy it would be to replace you and your skill set. It should not be thought that your income corresponds with how hard you work.  Sweatshop workers make less because they are easy to replace as they require a low skill set. To some extent, employers see employees as a commodity and means to an end. Just like you need soap to clean your floors you need factory workers to make your products. And like any smart business person, you want to pay the least amount as possible and still get the job done.  In regard to capitalism I would agree that it would be better for use to move away from it to something more socialist/communist. A lot of people would say that communism has never worked and they would be right. I think the issue has less to do with the morals of communism and has more to do with regards to the flaws of humanity. Humans are, by nature, competitive and selfish. I don't think we can, as a species, handle communism. The best we can hope for is to allign the goals of those with power with that of those without. For the most part, capitalism does a fair, albeit far from perfect, job at this.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Let the filthy rich eat their goddamn golden pizza.  They seem to waste their money but they are also giving the shop owner the price he/she paid.  It would be immoral if the rich bought food from all over the world and somehow consumed them all, because food is absolutely necessary and resource is scarce. However, gold is not necessary for survival at all, and if they were mined ethically, there is no problem at all. They should spend money for gold instead of gorging up stuff that takes up resources that are essential for survival. Don't you think then that it's better for them to spend money for seemingly unnecessary things so that others can use with what they paid? Money doesn't disappear somehow if someone uses it. Someone else that contributes to the creation of stuff receives it, and use them again for their own benefit.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This may sound redundant, but bad capitalism is very bad, and there is a lot of bad capitalism in the USA and the world in general. I'm not even going to argue that. The thing about liberal capitalist democracy is that ideally it should invite criticism. We call this free speech. Historically we have struggled with this and as a result we wind up with bad capitalism and oppression. However a surplus is always going to be needed to feed everyone and to create a stable working class that lives in comfort. Well call this surplus, profit, and the system of making this surplus capitalism. That's it. It's only as good or as bad as the people who use it, like any technology or social theory. So I invite criticism of capitalism, and in the case of injustice, protest, not to destroy it but to make it better, and more ethical. Which is what I call good capitalism, because good capitalism evolves, and adapts to fit the needs of the people who live wherever it is being practiced. I also invite social programs that are funded by the surplus in the form of taxes to combat poverty, medical care, infrastructure, education, and climate change. Republicans call this socialism but they are building a straw man to win elections (the same way leftists build a straw man out of capitalism to win arguments on the internet). Others call this social democracy but I think this down plays the fact that it is still built around a free market stock exchange. Revolutions don't work, they replace bad leaders with even worse leaders, and I feel completely comfortable saying this about the American revolution. Would the trail of tears have happened if the USA had remained a British colony? Would the USA as it is now have become so anglicized that it gave white supremacy some perceived scientific and therefore legal justification? Would chattel slavery have lasted as long as it did, and the civil war have even happened? Would there be a crisis at the border if manifest destiny ideology not been at the crux of conquering the western half of what is now the USA? Would the USA be so contrarian in dealing with climate change with it's allies if we didn't resent European elitism and lump academics in with that the way we do?  I can't answer any of these questions, but I do think about them,  but the only reason I can think and ask these questions (definitely not because I was born brilliant) is because I have the privileges and education that the surplus of capitalism has provided me and my family, and I have the freedom of speech, the right to assemble, and the right to vote as a constitutional right at least as a white person that is a natural born citizen. This allows for some political action and protests, and that is power that has value! So yes, lets redistribute wealth, rights, and citizenship to all people of all genders, races, and nationalities; but I can't imagine it happening any other way than through a system of ethical trade that generates a surplus that is fueled by economic competition coupled with a rigorous political process where all citizens can vote. This is not the USA that I live in, but I think it could be. Maybe I'm wrong, and I'm not thinking creatively enough, but I am highly skeptical of revolutionaries. Not because we are different but because we are so similar. From my experience some people with power have good intentions, and evil is just a matter of their careless incompetence, and apathy coupled with the opportunism of people who think they are righteous. I think calling what I'm talking about 'socialism' is a cop out. It's capitalism, ethical capitalism; and it will still have shiny stuff, movies and video games, ideally without the abuse. This will never fix everything but it can make lives better and inspire people to think up creative solutions that will benefit everyone, but I don't know, and I'm going to pretend to have all the answers.

"I really enjoyed your videos. They helped me think a lot outside my own box. Yet I'm still a Democrat that believes in capitalism. My father was a school teacher so I grew up believing education is the most important thing one can have. Just like the 'Count of Montecristo ' freedom can be taken away but knowledge is forever. I still feel it should not be free. Most people are willing to work harder at success when they know they had to pay a price. Some of the best musicians out there had tuff lives and had to overcome great trials to get where they are. Do you feel they're music would be just as uplifting if they hadn't had to work for it? Now a mix of health care. Some healthcare will even pay for whatever the politically correct way of saying a sex change is. Yet those that have gone through the procedure and had to pay for it themselves usually live better, healthier, and happier than those that received it free or at a huge discount. My point is more happiness comes from working for what we want than it being given to us. Let's try free preventative health care through the government and everything else through insurance or straight from the doctor. Lastly and then I'll get off my soap box. Happiness? What about joy? I was happy when I finally passed my algebra class after the 4th time. I was happy when I graduated from college. I felt joy when my nephew graduated from high school. No matter what type of society we live in joy and happiness come from ourselves. But I feel capitalism promises this if we work for it and work hard. I feel socialism and or communism doesn't promise this but suggests it. What they do promise is contentment. Put your trust in these leaders and you will be taken care of and you will be content. Leaders know there is less likely of an uproar if the villagers are content. I am a stubborn creative idealist that will never be content.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Dear Contra, thank you for such a well made statement. However, it only poses more questions then it brings answers. It appears to me that the problem with golden pizza is not just a problem with luxury items or capitalism, but with human thinking in general. Take the other examples of luxury. Things like Ferrari cars or Patec Philippe watches. Where will be their place in the socialist utopia? This products are insanely hard to produce which is making them very scarce in supply, still they are being valued and wanted. It can be said that their value is merely a social construct, and still they are, unarguably products of virtue. Patec Philippe and Ferrari employs specialists of godly qualification that put their life for creation of these products. They don't merely do this as passion or charity - they want to be rewarded for their rear talent and hard work by recognition, money and extreme value for their products. It is only possible if there is a certain degree of gatekeeping that creates the distance between them and other specialists, parallel to how it creates distance between their consumers and those that can not afford their product. Even if those products exist merely to show the perceived superiority of their owners, this superiority may be the may be the condition for self-betterment and innovation. People want to better themselves to be valued and they want to hold attributes of their value. Self-betterment and professionalism exists only if there is a distance between it and mediocrity, and it has to be expressed adequately - in money or filthy-rich shiny stuff that others can not afford. So since we are all philosophical - what will be the place of high professionalism in socialist utopia? What will it be expressed in? How will it be rewarded?

"I grew up in a society that experienced a huge shift from a socialist planning economy to capitalism (eastern Germany) - I was just 6 when the wall came down and of course our lives radically changed. I am a child of capitalism... but i grew up in a society marked by socialism (and russian glorification). There was this stupid joke that went something like the eastern equivalent of Alice in Wonderland is Olga in Aldi. But that excess of product was just... unimaginable. There. was. no. Competition between products. The government mandated what would be produced and that was the one kind of THING you could chose and everybody was the same. This system didn't work, but i wonder how it would have looked like, if the planning was perfect and allowed for individualization (people want to express themselves and felt they could do that with super expensive products from the west. Also there was an economic war going on... eastern consumer products rarely were as good as western ones, which became highly more desirable.)  Close relatives were a die hard believers in that system. But one of them lost her mind when she was allowed to work in a camp for western teenagers. She did realize, how much better the food was and the beds and just everything - why weren't eastern teenagers sleeping in the same kind of holiday accomondation? Sometimes... the Westerners left gum or hairbands behind, that were ... actually good. She was brainwashed into thinking that all these good products came at a very high cost of ideological downfall (which is true in some respect - but was the same in the east.)  One of my main observations was, that the sheer lack of products lead to a much closer knit society that had to help themselves. Creativity in obtaining products, a swelling black market. And the people were generally much more naive. Every customer wins / congratulations, you're the 1millionth visitor, here is your iphone? You bet ALL people would have believed that. But i am not sure, if that was purely the market or also the system with heavy surveillance and untrustworthy news / brainwashing.   It was forbidden to go to the west (traveling). I pestered my teachers and parents about that. Didn't you think that was unfair? Didn't you realize, you were prisoners? Weren't you angry at the government? Didn't you see the WALL? (it was there to protect us! not guard us...) Well, who is angry at the government for not being able to visit the moon? It was just the same category of unlikely and impossible - that's how the successful brainwashing worked.   I do thinkt he people were happier and way less stressed*. You had no real choice in what you were going to become, but money didn't matter that much anyway. Rent was cheap, childcare free of charge, everybody had work (be it thinly disguised busy work...) - *that is, if you were happy with the system.

This is the question it leads to - Is income inequality actually immoral, and if it makes you unhappy, is that actually a more significant point than looking at other indicators of progress, say education or healthcare.  The second question is of-course, one that you sidestepped. Skilled labor pays more than unskilled labor. Whatever someone's motivation may be for joining fields of scientific inquiry or engineering for that matter, it is a fact that it pays well, and if you were skilled, you'd much rather take that job than an unskilled one that pays less.

"Very amusing, and nice to stray from my usual conservative fare into the 'BreadTube'. But I think you undersell the sophistication and beauty of markets.   The golden pizza sucks, and that's why under capitalism practically no one consumes it. Costs are high and utility is low, so it is in very low demand - it's just a crass, niche joke for the uber rich. But under communism, we may not really know the true costs of creating such a pizza. Rather than following market signals (which average the PRIVATE information and preferences of millions of individuals into a single price: PRICES ARE AGGREGATED PREFERENCE-COST INFORMATION), communists produce as much as the politburo dictates. This is necessarily arbitrary, because they do not know how much gold pizza we truly want. Under communism, I could easily imagine a scenario where MORE golden pizza was being produced as a percentage of the total economy (it was dictated in some 5 year plan for whatever reason, and they continued being manufactured and thrown in a well for decades). This is not a joke. They almost killed the whales for arbitrary reasons: URL  So while I find your critiques of capitalism fine and reasonable, when you have to offer an alternative, there is simply nothing there. This is the classic 'least bad alternative' formulation of liberal capitalism. I think this is the despair of the far left AND right: they have no plausible alternative to the neoliberalism they so despise.  Incrementalism is necessary. Capitalism may ultimately undermine itself, so may liberalism. But it reminds me of what Peterson said about how Marxists under-estimate the depth of the problem of inequality. This is his point on lobsters - inequality is baked into the nature of existence itself, like the incel skulls. It is the pareto principle, and the hypergamy of the femoids... This is why JP cries when he talks about Pinocchio and Dostoevsky... it is the tragic nature of life itself. Marxists identify this tragedy with materialism and the economic system, but by under-estimating the depth of the problem, and make the tragedy radically worse. Soviet and Maoist communism weren't just 'kinda bad'. Hundreds of millions of people perished. Their historic cultures were wiped out and had to be restarted. The corruption even infected the human soul, which was the point of Solzhenitsyn. Your critique of Peterson was too flippant because you don't seem to recognize this argument, and anyways it is not Peterson's argument, he is just repackaged Dostoevsky-Solzhenitsyn. Make a video ContraPointing that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Socialism fails both in theory and in practice while capitalism succeeds in both. Your argument boils down to: 'theres a bunch of stuff going on that's not good under our capitalist system, therefore socialism', this is fallacious in two ways.   Firstly being that our society nowadays cannot really be called capitalist, the amount of bureaucratic, unnecessary regulation that is placed upon every level of the economy stifles growth and innovation to a considerable degree, to the point where some parts of the Chinese economy is less regulated than that of the USA. Also business are able to successfully lobby the government  to pass competition stifling regulation very easily.   Secondly, capitalism necessarily produces an imperfect outcome, meaning it will never be as good as socialism in the mind of a fervent Marxist. Capitalism is in many ways the lack of an economic system, and is the product of people just acting freely in accordance with certain moral rules. Compare capitalism in the real world to socialism in the real world, one system consistently produces authoritarian regimes and failing economies while the other works to gradually raise the living standards of all while allowing the rights of the individual to come first.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I agree that capitalism is not going to be here forever, and as it has been it shouldn't continue. But I also do not think that everything about capitalism is bad, the original concept of capitalism (my opinion) is beautiful. I don't want money to buy $2k pizzas, I want money to invest in projects and ideas, to invest in people, and to make this world a better place. 'If you had money would the world be a better or worse place?' Most people answer 'Better!' but when you ask them how they don't know how they would do it. The problem lies in not having a plan on how exactly we are going to do that. Money, on itself, doesn't exist, (stay with me and please ask for clarification if needed) 'money is a floating account mechanism from one human spirit to another.' What we put our money into is what we are going to get more of; I want more Contra videos, so I want to support Contra on Patreon. I believe we can create a new system in which we have the three 'p's in mind (people, planet, and profit) While learning from our past 'successes.' We don't need to reinvent the wheel. I don't think we need to stop capitalism once and for all, I think is happening naturally. The moment we create something better and more efficient this old system will cease to exist without having to 'eat the rich.'   I hope I made sense, please reply if needed and I will do my best to answer the question.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Well, i know this is probably going to backfire, BUT, since you have open up dialogue and i am subscribed to the channel and enjoy your wark. I, as a libertarian, should point some things you might consider.  Yes, a lot of criticism about capitalism is fair. (except the ones that are really rooted in marxist 'economics')  Since it is a 2 part video and i dont have good memory i will just wathever and that's it.  First of all the pizza,  yes it is bad, yes it seems like it serves no purpose, but we can not judge the purpose of other people, we can only evaluate the value of sumething subjective, the people that eat this kinda of abomination are not interested in eating a flavorful, delicious, calabresa pizza, they want the experience of eating gold, or some shit. Thats the classic water/diamond paradox, described by the economists.  I'm not an american, but i do know about some of the problems about wealth distribution, and expensive stuff, but there's a reason why medical care is so expensive, and there's a reason why people get paid very different. Its not about the amount of struggle, it's about the creative ways you suplly the market with things people want, thats why you channel is so successful, the left needed you and even some right wingers. There are jobs that no one likes to do, like the ones who involve thrash or...i dont know...reading the comment section of videos about politics, that's why some of those are 'worth' less, works like being a doctor makes tons of money not because of the work by it self, but the amount of people who fetichise being a doctor. At the end of the day its more about who wants the stuff more and who wants less.  Yes, i am saying welth innequality is natural, at the rates we have are kinda of bad, but this amount is not intrinsic to the free market itself, but the state-capitalist society we all live. They are a product of regulations, taxes and labour rights as contradictory as it seems.    Aaaand happiness, it's very hard to talk about this, since happiness is so vague, but i do know that consumerism and the amount of marketing is something we can all work against, with conscient spending and etc. But the reason we endorse the markets is an ethical one, and anyone should think about this way, and not with utilitarian mindsets.  well thats it, i will answer any question, please be respectful. love your work","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"So you want a directed economy but not quite socialism where the state enforces the direction by way of centralization, but perhaps through a shared faith-culture/constitution which defines the guideline to work within while moving forward?  So like adding another 1-2 points to the USA Constitution; one for striving toward an awesome society for all citizens but without explicitly enforcing such into law with specific policies because it is too vague & subjective, but could work toward redirecting revenue investments by societal collective faith(?) and another one for the guidelines to work within moving forward so that the wealth generated does not stray too far from desirable developments and is focussed toward a unifying principle(?). ~Hm~ Good luck with that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Hey Contrapoints amazing video...  After listening I have a few questions that I'm trying to process through...   1) How should one begin designing guidelines on ethical distribution of personal wealth? - Or How should I be spending my money?   - Ya I know... Not really a question you ask someone else. Lol   2) Where is the line between spending money on something that's personally significant to you, such as a sail boat. ( A big dream of mine) vs. the guilt of spending so much money that I could be using to help empower others? Who get's to decide were this money goes? Doesn't me choosing who to empower others through my money resemble the same thing that the current 1% already does by supporting their friends etc etc...    3) Is there such a thing as healthy and ethical advertising? Or is any version of programming a need into an individual unethical? (Selling the dream)    4) I'm a sales associate and damn good one.  Since I'm the gatekeeper of individuals who choose to participate in our business, how can I make sure that I'm doing a good job vetting people who will receive genuine value and empowerment vs those who are just purchasing us because of capitalist programming?  I wanted to pose these questions because I want to digest this information with other people, not just be told the 'right way'.  Except I'm not sure where to begin...

"Does what you earn belong to you or does it belong to everyone else? Yes you Could buy 100 meals for 1000 dollars or you could buy one meal for 1000 or any other variation of cost but in the end it is what you have earned that you are trading out for sustenance. Currency isn't something you just hold it is made to be traded, The business that made the $1000 pizza now has 1000 dollars that then Could be used to buy 100 kids $10 meals. Nothing was lost in the transaction, People are allowed to be stupid with their money.  Now the reason why people are more stressed by earning more money is not because of Golden Pizza but instead that rich people have to balance finances for their income i.e. People are rich because they created an economy at their own risk (economic or personal) and doing so is *Stressful.* The key factor is that these people created an income rather than making a labor trade with someone with more money. That's why sweat shop workers aren't millionaires, they rely on an individual to give them money rather than several individuals. However Sweatshops are an overseas concept today and they're communist over there.-\_(tsu)_/- We aren't a planned economy here so there is no point arguing against it. Since there are problems with the economy, it is better to see it as a flow than static structure like a river. If people aren't receiving water because water doesn't flow to them is that because A. They are somewhere where the water never flows or B. The water was redirected? In either case we want to either move the people to the water or move the water to the people, any way that it is achieved will have its own hurdles as is life. Therefore if People aren't receiving what they need to survive (in this case money) we have to look at Why that is, if down the river it's that someone is choking the source then unchoke it. We don't want to flood the river (inflation) or cause a drought (prevent money from moving) but a choke is not the same thing as a dam so we will be safe by removing the choke.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

No, there's still as you said going to be things to buy under socialism that gets sold through capitalist ways and YES there WILL be advertising to sway people to buy from them over another retailer of a similar product. Socialism sounds like it would be great however I don't feel that it is fully understood by most advocates for the system. While I enjoyed listening to you talk about the liberation of the masses I don't think you're thinking much after that. Do more research, do more videos and also talk to people with opposing views also don't just talk about the grand things such as toppling the lizard people, talk about what I brought up, how you will spend your money and through what ways the market will operate and how you will buy the things you need and yes want because the best form of advertising is seeing someone else use a product that you don't have, even if it's just on the street.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The argument that capitalism is materialistic doesn't really resonate with me. I lean to the right on the free-market spectrum, but open to changing my mind.   I rent a small room in an apartment with 2 roommates. I don't own a car. I walk/bike/uber around town (suburban Atlanta). I'm a minimalist and all my possessions can fit in two suitcases. What I love about the free market is the diverse ecosystem of services and experiences, and new things are being innovated every day that make it even less necessary to own material possessions. I don't have cable tv. I don't read magazines. I avoid crowded places with billboards. I don't feel constantly bombarded with advertising, and so I don't understand why people who feel there's too much advertising don't just remove themselves from the places where all that advertising is.  I'm in favor of a social safety net, and making the current safety net more generous. I'm in favor of progressive tax system, and making our current rates more progressive. I also think markets are amazing things and central planning and too much government regulation can be bad. I think that makes me some kind of social democrat.

Under communism all economy is ruled by the government, jobs are guaranteed for life.  In communism this can become boring and under capitalism it is to say the least dangerous if your business does not survive.  What would be great is that there could be a mix of the both.

"I've been working at Merrill (formerly Merrill-Lych) for a few months now as an executive intern for an acquisitions manager and what I think most people seem to miss in the conversation of capitalism is that capitalism is amoral at it's core. Capitalism is a robot designed to generate the largest amount of money possible, irrespective of the implications of those robotic processes. The morality of applied capitalism is much more a function of government regulation than of economic purity. Human intervention on capitalism is what got us here in America in trouble. As the capitalist machine grew, politicians hijacked it for their own benefit.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Okay, I've just sharpened my quill so, lets start with the question: What defines capitalism? Private ownership. Okay, that's found in literally every society, since even the bushmen has their own lionsloth. Add private ownership of means of production. You get feudalism. Just to note, when you live in a comunist hunter and gatherer tribe where there is redistribution of products of work, then just forget that you alone would benefit from your work. Even the most stinky douche from your tribe will have a share from the hunt and if you mind it, you're out. Add explotiong of the worker. Not going for the same answer twice, but the institution of slavery or even servantery (? is it a word?) that is ancient and world-wide is also a nice example. So how about exchange value - look at Kula trade of Polynesians, the most precious thing they can imagine is a shell armbend (quite pretty just for the record) and it's use value is like for any jewelery, it's so valued because it has a symbolic value, it's about prestige. Well that's pretty fetishistic. And they also trade other things among their tribes instead of producing them alone so that's pretty capitalist of them. You know, even if you look at the gift economy like Mauss described, it's always the same principle, people evaluate the thing according how much it seems valueble, there's no 'use value' or 'value derived from work' since it's all arbitrary  'well how it kinda seems it should be priced, guys, what do you think it should be? value' , and than they give and expect to get your payment in another gift or your loyalty (there it goes the reification of social relations) but no one's giving a thing for free, it's all cold calculation and promise of profit. Income defferences - royalty. But I really like a feature that was described by Wallerstein: capitalism is supposed to be built on protestant etique which means work and work and work and be modest, don't spent, so there's gonna be plently of product just stickin' in your butt completely unused. So there's the seed of the bottomless pit of the throat of a capitalist, the bottomles abyss in their heart, the thing is not what it is, but what drives it: the infinite accumulation. That you would take the surplus value and innovate so you can make more and get the surplus and innovate and get even more until your anal cavity explodes! But as I said, you can observe an interesting shift in the reasoning: the definition derived from 'why', from the motivation. And where do you get a motivation? Well, from your values, and those are provided from your world-view, your cosmology, your religion, they tell you what you should value, what you should want, what you should do with your life. Let's imagine that those managers and CEOs and owners would just one they say: okay you know what, I think I had enough, I just don't need more zeros on my account, I'll just give another profit to emprove the health care system for common people. Nuh-uh, no way that would happen. Because mummy didn't say: boy, you should built a state where everyone's happy, no, she said: boy, beat them all and be the best, and when you make something then shove it up your butt immeadiately. I repeat, immediately, or those poor basterd will rip you off. Just ask yourself: would you prefer, your kid to be succesfull, capable, smart and rich or good hearted? Aha! so there we go. Capitalism is not a living thing that you can fight, no don't be delusional, it's a tool. It's a tool in hands of people that use it idioticaly, because the good old fashioned christian values are now not good enough anymore and weren't replaced by any other system. Today's world-view that drives us is generally absolute shit, it's incoherent and it's explanatory potential is near zero so people concentrate on the lowest drives and every low-selary worker, if he got the opportunity to be rich, would just kick the asses of his once commerades, because now he made it to the top and that's the thing! Most people are ill-equipped to deal with social question of a complex globalized society and the postmodernism culture is not helping much as an answer for it because most people can't handdle the fact that 'nobody knows what the fuck the truth is', so they just hole up. So you know, when someone says: 'I don't really like capitalism' they say 'I kinda mind that the world is a cruel place and it seems we're all fucked' and the cure for it is then not 'let's fight capitalism, the economic system that provides the most opportunities and freedom of invention and desire' but rather 'let's find some world-view providing values that would enable to use capitalism in a way that the majority of population wouldn't get fucked in the ass, and also provide a lifestyle that makes as little damage to the psyche as possible. I've spoken.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"You make an utilitarian analysis of capitalism with 2 holes.  1 ) you mention capitalism is bad a distributing goods. Capitalism doesnt distribute goods, economic liberalism does. A communist society is capitalistic too, it's just that all the cpaital is in the hands of the bureaucrats..... therefore it's not *liberal*  2)you claim capitalism/liberalism is bad at maximizing happiness, however a true utilitarian perspective requires to compute hapiness *in the long run*. It is usually perceived that poverty (unbalanced supply an demand) provides the incentive to find a better supply /demand position. In other words, you are peeling potatoes in a factory, your salary is rock bottom, because there are many people willing to take your job, instead of bitching about capitalism/liberalism you are supposed to find another activity that will reward you more.

"Capitalism doesn't have to fail and there need not be a revolution. The great thing about capitalism is it invites competition. Organizations can be created, anything you want, and it can compete with established organizations that create inequality. The problem is the perception of the masses---people love Steve Jobs, but he would not have succeeded in business if he were not able to convince people to invest in his ideas. Jobs was loved by people because of his success--after the fact, not before. When the masses decide to love inventors, makers, etc., because of their socialist leanings as well as their ideas before they become successful--to invest in them, then things will change for the better.    And, I blame the Jews for circumcisions. I am missing my foreskin and I demand reparations. (I looked for a lawyer to represent me in this matter, but unfortunately, all the good ones I know and trust are Jewish. Oh well.)  (this is my attempt at humor, before I go on a rant.)    And, I blame them for interest rates. Which is true, Jews did invent interest--the tool currently being used to enslave. After all, I could build you house that lasts for 500 years and amortization the cost over 300 years without charging interest at all, if I had the wealth for the initial sunk cost--but that is too much for most people to think about, I imagine. It is all a fiction that seems like a force of nature--but it is made up. Interest rates are determined by the Fed, and mortgages are for 30 years usually and a house will last from 30 to 60 years. All convenient numbers nobody bothers to question. But I could do a mortgage in house, without the government and without interest and still make a modest profit, if I only had the initial sunk cost to kick off a construction/lending organization designed to last for millennia--like the Catholic Church, for example--(Notre Dame, 800 years old, while the little slaves live in disposable housing). Religions figured this stuff out already.   Any takers on kicking me some money--I need about 250 million to make a go  of it--so I can build really affordable housing, excellent for the environment, will keep people safe in a hurricane and last for 500 years? Probably not. If I made 250 million on my own, would I build houses with it to prove my point? Maybe. But why should I? Where were all the detractors of capitalism who supported my socialist ideas but wouldn't invest in them when I was starting out? Maybe not.    All the problems can be solved in the capitalist system we already have. The problem is human nature, which won't change. I am a nobody, so why listen to me? But I need you now so I can bring about equality. If I were millionaire, if I were extremely successful, people would pay attention---but then I don't need people, I am already successful--why should I help the little people now that I am rich? No one would listen to me when I was poor and full of idealism.   So, don't blame capitalism. Take a good look in the mirror. People live in houses with granite counter tops and foundations so pathetic a new industry has sprung up that specializes in fixing cracked foundations----and this is normal. Instead of building fireproof homes we have smoke detectors and about 3000 deaths a year due to house fires, mostly the very young and very old--and this is normal.    The world is exactly the way people want it to be and it won't change no matter the form of government. A revolution would change a damn thing--there would still be the haves and the have nots.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Truth behind capitalism: every human wants to have a higher income, but buys a cheaper goods. So, cheapiest goods, that people are buying in largest amounts, are literrally MADE OF bad working conditions, most likely, in third-world countries.   But what an average socialist wants? EXACTLY the same. But FOR ALL THE PEOPLE. But if we take practice, not the theory, the equilibrium is impossible, because people expect different 'ideal incomes' and have different ideas about 'fair price'. So, if if you want every worker to earn $ 70,000 a year, then you can't make pizza worth a dollar. The purchasing power of these 70,000 dollars will fall, and the level of 'comfortable' income will increase.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"_Ugh, there is so much nonsense here. You are presuming in your happiness analysis that the function of accumulated capital is to simply consume more commodity goods as opposed to operating an enterprise, developing new ideas , or investing in large scale research. Peter Thiel doesn't aim to consume large amounts of golden pizzas, but rather intends to build an organization that can make things better and better, more efficient, productive and invest in new ideas. He wishes to operate his own organization rather than be employed by one(including the government, because....fuck those guys), or as Von Mises would say, he wishes to direct his own human action rather than have another direct it for him. He, AS AN ORGANIZATION, leads labor via his accumulated capital. He doesn't engage with labor to consume golden stuff. That is simply a caricature. He is an INDIVIDUALSIT that believes individual initiative should be rewarded and be given the ability to develop new ideas, new methods, discover old archeological sites, (a lot of billionaire Germans used to do this with their money for some reason),build private educational systems (looking at you Peterson) with its own respective philosophy, develop homes of worship, etc,etc,etc. Reductionist should be your channels name. Moreover, you said post scarcity. HAHAHAHA. Scarcity will never be done with, whether that be scarcity along metrics of material goods, property holdings, informational mastery, theological grounds, psychological grounds, athletic grounds etc,etc,etc..Information is the new source of scarcity, of the many that already exist, and has become a bedrock for SPECIALIZATION (a word you should really look up) in which individuals are being reimbursed. Youre guiding individuals along the deep Information sets of Leftist literature (Mostly outrage drivel that is Apriori ANTI EMPIRICAL) is reimbursing you with physical capital conferred along digital formats, a method of Transfer that wasnt developed until some capitalist brought it to you for you to utilize.   I also love how you keep saying DISTRUBTED, as if the pie generated was just randomly produced. That my friend, is called a tendentious argument. Nobody distributes the income centrally. People are reimbursed, in general, for the risk profile they consensually assume in conjunction with the amount of human capital they put forward. Everything you are saying is pure, 19th century debunked, reductionist nonsense that has a thin veneer of intellectualism to it. Look up methodological individualism folks, and all this pontificating agitators' propositions fall flat.  And oh, my god, 'They have to be poor for others to be rich?' Who tells you this nonsense? That presumes a ZERO-SUM PRODUCTION OF THE ECONOMY IN WHICH THE GDP GROWTH IS STATIC! And you already showed from your last video that the GDP is NOT static. You are deliberately indoctrinating, polarizing, and lying premised of unsubstantiated nonsense. If the market did generate a zero-sum outcome, then living standards and consumption of goods would remain stagnant. There is a reason why a 'poor' westerner consumes and lives a more enriched and leisured life than Rockefeller, the richest man of the time, did.  And as I said before, YOU are not compensated for ONLY how hard you work. You are also compensated for risk assumed, innovation, productivity, efficiency, and total number of CONSENSUAL transactions achieved. I can work all day making mud pies, work very hard and be very good at it. BUT IF NOBODY WANTS MY PRODUCT, then it doesn't matter how hard I work. I have to engage in consensual transactions millions of times for peoples labor tokens to actually be transferred to me and enable me to become a millionaire. Those invented sufferers that you claim work so hard to feed their invented flock of children, a very specious argument that is antiempirical if you ask me, but I will play along, are the product of their OWN mismanagement and poor decision making probably. If you spent your days NOT INVESTING INTO HUMAN CATIAL, but rather consuming, never differing gratification, and not serving others with utility, then you are not going to be reimbursed. Easy as that. You don't saddle yourself with large amounts of debt obligations if you do not have the human capital or literal capital to contend with such SCARCITY. You know, accountability?

"From the last nonsensical video you posited -Yeah. That's not true at all. THIS IS PURE MISINFORMATION. All you did was hold a bunch a variables constant and describe how those things are evil. You are aware that 'those reptiles' are people like Peter Thiel, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, James Harris Simons and all the rest right? Where were they 30 years ago? Nowhere to be found right? That is because they were SO PRODUCITVE, EFFICEINT and INNOVATIVE that they generated new value for people, in the interest of capital, that wasn't there before. Duh. This is economics 101. You are reimbursed for the level of human capital and skill you endow to the market. Prices and value conferred are simply a reflection of how many CONSENSUAL TRANSACTIONS YOU ENGAGED IN. You can make mud pies all day at your house, and work really hard, but if nobody is willing to exchange labor tokens for them (aka money), then your effort was all for not. Nobody designs this at all. Prices are simply a reflection of scarcity. The scarcity is generated by the hyper-complex, grand INTERDEPENDENCY known as the free market.  You also are aware that the 'CEO Lizard is reimbursed' in a completely different fashion than the 'poor worker' right? That CEO is taking 100x more risk than the labor. His compensation is pegged to the performance of the company via shares and bonds, NOT HOURLY INCOME. Company dies, he gets booted, and the LABOR ARE TO BE REIMBUSRED. CEO's come, and go, come and go. They are not static positions that are unaffected BY COMPETITON! Also, that angst you speak of is typically sourced from students who took no PRACTICAL OR PRAGMATIC considerations into account when applying their free time to fields of study. Accounting and engineering, computer science and medicine solve more PRACTICAL problems, therefore, over time, they TYPICALLY get reimbursed more than theatre arts homie. Duh. You keep making it seem as if reality IMPARTS NO COSTS ON HUMANS. You are aware that if nobody engages in accountancy, companies and organizations, hell, even households will be needlessly wasteful in how their production is allotted and consumed right? You are aware that if nobody engages in appropriate civil engineering techniques, bridges will fall right? It doesn't matter if we feel like engineering is boring, hard, or too technical. What matters is that REALITY will impart a cost on you for dispensing with rigor and dispensing with practicality. Yeah, and advertising? Umm, that is an attempt to convince you to consume. IT IS A CONSENSUAL TRANSACTION!!! You are not obligated to consume, but rather you can apply your earned capital elsewhere. Who told you to consume? Nobody. You simply say, NAH, I'M good, and then move on. They have the right to advertise, and you have the right to reject or consume. YEAH, FREEDOM IS PRETTY COOL.  And I love how you bitch about Uber, a company that never existed until like 5 minutes ago. They are a developing firm trying to make everyone more efficient. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO WORK FOR THEM. If you don't like the deal they put forward, then walk away and apply yourself elsewhere. Easy as that. Freedom to engage in contracts is nice. And bloated loans? Yeah, that's a consequence of BLOATED, CENTRALIZED, BUREACRATIC government, not the free market. There is no truly free market in medicine or education thanks to people like you dumby. And those homeless people? Uh dude, you need a more precise picture of it bro. How can you dictate what their every individual choice was? Some of those individuals chose it, rejected every helping hand, committed crimes, financially mismanaged their wealth, couldn't conform to a routinized life that a domesticated home necessitates, etc,etc,etc. (My wife is a social worker, so I can attest to the EXTREME COMPELXTIY that generates homelessness) And yeah, the lack of support is a consequence of DILLIBERATE MISREPRESENTATION BY AGITATING, POLARIZING HACKS LIKE YOU.

"12:20 Generally, I think there are two main reasons why upper management and executive positions are payed far more than positions lower in the command chain. The first is to provide motivation for entry-level employees to work harder. If the higher paycheck is something to be envied, then it can be seen as a goal to work towards. I can't speak for everyone, but speaking for myself, I like the idea of being paid more for better work because I know I'm going to work as hard as I can. If my best just isn't good enough, at least I know the best product is getting put out there. The second reason I think the pay gap is so wide is that executives (should) carry the responsibility for every downfall the company may face. (See 'Sword of Damocles') If the company takes a hit, it should be the executive's responsibility to ensure they stay afloat. If not, it's the captain who must go down with the ship to ensure that the rest survive. Obviously not all executives are so virtuous. I do believe the pay gap between the lowest employees and top executives in certain companies are beyond ridiculous because it exceeds the risk that being in the position of power entails, (Disney, Apple, Comcast, just to name a few) but I think these problems can be solved within the capitalist system. The simplest answer would be to just stay humble. Obviously that's not very realistic as it can't really be enforced by anyone. Maybe CEOs shouldn't be allowed to earn more than 1000 times more than their lowest paid employees? Idk, maybe they'd just outsource all their work to independent contractors or robots then. Maybe companies should be allowed more freedom to vertically integrate, granting them direct power over the distribution apparatus. It could a sort of 'i do me, you do you' sort of thing. I don't know, I'm not an economist.  On an unrelated note, the concept of measuring an economic system's efficiency by levels of happiness seems to be attributing issues not inherent to capitalism itself to a society that merely happens to be capitalist (granted, you could argue it's not even 'real' capitalism, whatever that means). As for what exactly IS causing capitalist malaise, I can't really say. As for me, I'm happy enough I guess. I don't get much, but I have enough. I don't give much, but I give what I can when I can. To be honest I don't really expect much either. Capitalism seems to be working for me just fine. It's not like some lizard-man snuck up behind me and injected me with depression-anxiety juice in order to brainwash me into buying more stuff to fill the gaping void in my heart.  I don't hold any of these to be ultimate truth. I'm still learning and I just accept whatever makes the most sense. If you can prove me wrong, please do. I assure you I will be more than willing to listen.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think there are some much stronger versions of the argument for Capitalism that you preemptively attacked.  For the sake of brevity, I'll make the strongest versions of those arguments without what I personally think of them.    The first two are connected so I'll deal with them together Real income inequality from wage labour exists primarily because of differences in labour productivity and degree market concentration, rather than being determined by how hard someone works. If cleaners and medical researchers were paid the same, assuming labour supply is wage elastic, diminishing marginal returns on labour means that the value of the greater cleaning done is less than the value of the medical research lost. Income is not the only determinant of where labour is allocated or how hard people work but it is an important one - if teachers were paid as much as investment bankers there would be a lot more teachers.  If you're a utilitarian, the fact that income doesn't correlate with how hard someone works doesn't matter in and of it's self, if you're not that Nozick's defence is the classic one, although slavery, class and oligopsony mean that property was neither attained fairly nor is the transaction fair.     The third argument is just poor, but it is entirely true that what interest group you align with informs what you advocate for, even if that has no bearing on the argument in and of itself.    The argument that socialism will inherently turn into authoritarian dictatorship is that by giving the state complete economic power, as would be the way to achieve socialism without using revolutionary methods is that a) a lack of economic freedom is a type of oppression itself b) that there will be resistance to this and, if one rejects democratic methods, dictatorship will have to be established to enforce socialism and c) that giving the state this much power will make it much more able to abuse it's power and that Marxist ideologies creates opponents who are considered justified targets for revenge and finally that there will be no one who has any actual ability to put a check on state power.

If there is an excess of food than some animal is going to eat  it, no one is born with an internal limiter, we can say no to stuff but we don't want to say no. This makes Capitalism problematic but the same will apply to every other system.   Let's say we tweak things a bit and take $ from the top and give it to the bottom. Than we create other problems of a similar nature. How much is enough? If we create the utopia, where everyone has his basic needs met than no one will take very unpleasant job. Reason is very very simple.   We don't want to do very unpleasant things if we don't have to.   Most unpleasant jobs are done by people because they have to. You can increase the wage, but this will not gonna help because fact of it being unpleasant is still there. Person gonna seek the more pleasant job, or gonna settle on not working if there is nothing else to do.   There is also a problem of producing wealth. Capitalism is good at it.

When you see companies like Walmart with lots of low value workers, those bits add up, and there's really not that much that can be done, at least from a business perspective, with that money that doesn't look like a waste.

"I absolutely love leftist critiques of capitalism, and no, this isn't some back-handed remark. Not only is it good to listen to opposing view points, but the very different perspectives on these issues really shows. A right winger looks at capitalism and sees opportunity cost, trying their hands at working the system, supply and demand, and all of this other stuff that is exclusively dedicated to the study and mastery of the free market and its efficiency. On the other hand, the left takes a more 'big-picture' approach to capitalism without studying the intricacies of how markets can be efficient based on their experience of where it is quite obvious they are not efficient. If anyone on the left wishes to examine right wing political philosophy from a right wing perspective, I'll paint the general picture. We want a society as close as possible to the one you could form on a deserted island, these are your inalienable human rights. Add in more people, and the scene becomes more complex and you must discard some freedoms to retain others. It is the goal of right wing philosophy to minimize the number of concessions in this framework.

"Really appreciate the nuance. I find myself conflicted a bit, and perhaps it's mostly semantic. It could also be because my partner is a self pronounced anarcho-capitalist and I've grown tired of debating him (and being called a communist) ((I still love him, he's a treasure)).  Capitalism as he understands it is...just the exchange of goods, and that the real enemy is the state; that a world devoid of the state would naturally turn towards capitalism and individualism, creating networks of exchange and, apparently, champagne for all.  I hear that criticism to a degree. Capitalism on the small scale seems to serve the common good, at least for individuals....but then that's assuming that you alone make, harvest, find, homestead, all your product, and that all other people you collaborate with do the same, or that you at least don't violate the sacred Non Aggression Principle (NAP) @_@  In part one you mentioned that capitalism only maintains it's power by the state. Not to be a tabbyist (I grew out of my catgirl phase), but it would seem like the best course of action would be to actively erode the state by creating grass-roots institutions that serve the community. Like, instead of police we organize our local communities to be something akin to minutemen militias with less hatred for the english and more an emphasis on grabbing your shit and hitting the street when Old Lady Minerva down the block accidentally sets her kitchen on fire again while baking quiche. Food pantrys are another good example, and if expanded might they not be able to erode the deathgrip big box stores have on our world? But then, I suppose there is a loss of luxury standing in the breadlines, unless the bread is covered in gold or something...  It's a complicated issue to be sure. I think that there are moves we can make in the now that can actively affect neoliberalism, which I think it a more effective target than either the state or capitalism. The state seems, to me, to be an emergent property of human social dynamics. John has the biggest stick so John gets to make the rules. As Thucydices (yay greek) said 'The strong must do what they can and the weak must suffer as they must' (he was probably a giant asshole). There does seem to be some real, depressing truth to that. Just as capitalism disperses wealth in horribly inefficient ways, it seems like humans, be they communist, capitalists, fascists, anarchist, or what have you, tend towards dispersing power in terribly inefficient ways.  I'm just a transy theologian, so I don't really know what I'm talking about.

"Good video(s). However, there is a serious problem with your critique. The word 'inequity' assumes that value is objective and well-defined from the perspective of the economic system as a whole. But the reality is that value is fundamentally subjective, which means that different people value different things differently and at different times. A glass of water is not worth the same to a person lost in an arid desert as it is to a person standing next to a natural spring. Similarly, the wage disparity between a CEO and a janitor is bound to reflect the comparative difficulty of finding a person to fill each position. Capitalism is not a coherent set of values or beliefs. It is not an ideology in the same vein that Marxism is an ideology. Capitalism is an umbrella term for a set of phenomena that arise as a result of the subjectivity of value. The same phenomena will emerge in a communist, socialist, or anarchist society, even though the currency may be power instead of money.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"While purer forms of capitalism genuinely do have the problems raised in this video, I don't believe getting rid of capitalism entirely is the answer, or is even possible. As long as people are willing to trade they will not be able to eradicate currency, and any attempt to prevent capitalism from recreating itself out of simple trade due to people all having different wants will require a form of law enforcement which must operate above the ordinary citizen, creating a heirarchical inequality again, blah blah 1984 or something.  The reality is that things can't be evenly distributed when people can't percieve it as an even distribution, and that's simply to do with the problem of wealth & income inequality.  Another problem is ads. There would be no ads if there were no free markets, right? Yeah maybe, *but* there would also be no ads if there were anti-advertisement restrictions placed on still capitalist marketplaces. This would mean people would have to start shopping by product reviews and prices, helping with the realization that the best product isn't always the most expensive and the best place to buy it isn't always the one they saw on TV that one time.  But what about free content? Donation-based content! Public grant funded content!  But what about patents and trademarks? Can't people and corporations own monopolistic rights towards distribution of certain products? Yes, but having currency doesn't mean having patent and trademark laws. Abolish them, but like, in a slower way than actually just abolishing them outright. Replace them with a system of giving credit, like many copyleft lisences have, where instead of making sure nobody else can steal your idea, you gotta make sure they have to say it was your idea.  So what about the people who live in poverty, those who can't afford the basic human rights? Get some goddamn social infrastructure in place so that everyone can afford to live regardless.  But what about the lazy asses who will try to just live off welfare and not work a day in their life? Well good thing they're not getting killed off, as you can tell though living off of social infrastructure isn't exactly a life of luxury either, which is good if they don't deserve luxury.  But what if they can't work? More social infrastructure. Have them prove or and provide them compensation.  Basically I believe in capitalism, but without ads, patents, or trademarks.

"One of the few effective things that I think people can do to resist or revolt under a capitalist system is to try to even out economic inequality. This means coming up with low-cost, low upkeep systems that make basic necessities more accessible to everybody. A prime example would be starting a community garden or convincing established institutions or businesses to dedicate some of their property to edible landscaping for anyone to harvest. Alternatively, find ways for people to benefit from what others are throwing out. If you can turn something that is effectively viewed as garbage into something of value, you have effectively created more wealth from something that was being squandered and likely cost little. Obviously, this could be done corruptly by a corporation, but when the goods or profits made through upcycling benefit the underserved and impoverished, you have essentially fabricated additional wealth, which could provide a slight advantage to those struggling to thrive in a corrupt economic system.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I'm very glad you made this second part and didn't leave it at 'lizards are controlling everything'. May I suggest a third part that tackles the 'I don't know how to overthrow Capitalism, who do you think I am?' by taking a look at how Capitalism is already being replaced in niche projects like gift economies, solidarity agricultures and anarchist communes and how some of the ideas used in those projects are present even in our normal day-to-day lives? Not everything we do is dictated by Capitalism (yet). When we go camping with friends and share food, when we voluntarily take the trash out without being paid for it, when we babysit each other's children. I honestly feel like if you leave it at this, with a vague 'there must be better systems', it'll do little to alleviate people's despair and hopelessness, and thus their begrudging acceptance of Capitalism.

Basically, getting rid of capitolisim would mean people would actually have to believe in their ability to do things without being forced to do them and it would take people actually having a desire to share with each other, and an understanding that if they don't share with each other, they are giving other people permission not to share with them. It would take a dramatic overhaul in how people think. many of us are already there. That's why I think socialism is going to be expanded and we will all have healthcare and an education within a decade, as well as access to jobs and clean energy in a way we never have in this country before.

"Another fantastic video! My humble thanks!   A couple of points, Kuznet, whom developed GDP cautioned about using it to measure welfare to begin with. Governments lost that in translation a long time ago.   Also, happiness is a tricky one as its hard to define. Often feelings of happiness, showing emotions, are more often demonstrated to the highest degree by the poorest countries..Paraguay, Costa Rica, Panama, Uzbekistan and the Philippines.   Happiness measured by life satisfaction sees typically the Nordics placing very high, yet very low in terms of showing emotional happiness. I highly question the usefulness of happiness studies as no matter how happy us westerners are or are not, we are leading a horrible example on how to live on a planet with finite resources due to our political and economic systems require growth in order to maintain stability...which is juxtaposed to where we need to go.   I would suggest humanity needs a new mission and that is to live within planetary boundaries. This would legitimize our existence and give us a sense of purpose. This can be extended to solving other global challenges as well. Personally, I think happiness is achieved when  we are able to self actualize which in turn means being able to serve others.

"Alot of the points brought up in this video as a critique seem to be more of a critique of government controlled programs rather than actual buisnesses. Capatalism is not forcing anybody to take up a job you dont like. It is the lack of competition brought in by a lack of a true free market that is making people buy overpriced shitty products or work for low wages. When capatalism is fully embraced, we actually have better services and cheaper products. Just look at privatised healthcare for instance. Privatised healthcare, although not very cheap, still has brought us innovations we would have never had if it werent for the competetive nature of the free market.  The free market I refer to is a market that provides the goods and services that the people want. The more people take part in this free market and the more trade that occurs, the more people will be more well off. This is the essence of capatalism and this is why I am proponent of it currently.  Now, I do not think that capatalism is perfect. On the contrary, I think capatalism will be a detriment to many people as we move into the future. Due to automation and technological advances, we are going to see more and more of workforce without jobs as their skill will no longer be applicable. Now, granted, this is still another 10 years away, but thats still pretty close in the grand scheme of things.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Fighting a major illness that has lead to daily doctors office visits for radiation has lead me to have major medical bills which I think are unfair. This illness has also lead to my being out of work with plenty of excess time on my hands to watch Youtube videos... Anyway, why do the rich continue to stockpile money? With people like Gates and Bezos you would think that they would eventually realize they have enough and yet both continue to earn more each year. I think it starts out with the need to survive. In order to survive we need money and the more money you have the easier your survival becomes *gulp* er.... as I was saying they feel the need to move 'above the heard' where they can survive more easily. Once they reach this point however it becomes about happiness. 'The more money I have the more stuff I can have. Stuff makes me happy. I want more stuff hence I need more money.' Yet stuff does not make us happy it only gives us a temporary high that quickly wears off. Proof of this can be spotted at any Goodwill where you will find the state of the art electronics of ten years ago collecting dust in the corner. CRT television anyone? So people like Bezos need to buy more and more stuff to keep them high. Eventually they realize that stuff is not making them happy so it becomes 'well, what else is there?' At that point I think making money becomes more of a game. Each dollar represents one point and the object becomes about seeing how many points you can rack up. This likely also does not make them happy and so they are likely just as miserable as the rest of society. The trick is to somehow get them to see that the system is making them miserable too and that changing that system would probably be a good idea. If anyone has any ideas about how to do this I'm all ears.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Socialism does scare me a little bit though. I mean, I hear about the shangri la these European countries have and I imagine we should adapt what appears to be working. But then I hear about these yellow jackets all over Europe talking about how they're being taxed out of house and home as well.  When the founding fathers came up with our govt with all it's checks and balances meant to predict and deter the corruption and unregulated greed we see today, they had 'the citizen's right to the pursuit of happiness' in mind. And they had that in mind b/c of the persecution they fled from. They saw how miserable and hopeless the citizens were in the old world b/c they all knew they were never going to work hard enough or achieve anything that would allow them to escape their social class. And they saw how important it was for people to have hopes and dreams and ambition for a better life and to feel that they could pursue their own happiness, even if they never achieved it, there was still a chance.  BUT.... Like every other successful empire, where there is money... greed will find a way. To corrupt those checks and balances and rob the people blind, beyond hope of bringing them down or getting the power back.

"The arguments you address here are the sort of low-brow arguments you hear mostly from conservatives who don't actually understand how or why capitalism works (or at least, how it could work if we had better economic policies). They are not the arguments you'll hear from educated neoliberals or classical liberals. I'm not exactly advocating cutthroat small-state capitalism, nor do I think you would be particularly sympathetic to the arguments of its advocates. On the other hand, if you were to look at social-democratic economists or neoliberal economists who favour redistribution, I think you would not only have a better understanding of its advocates, but you'd also be able to make a much more insightful criticism of it, as you are already making very insightful videos on other topics.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Capitalism is good, actually.  Okay well, capitalism is pretty shitty as you've made an excellent case for, but markets are a necessity. Neoliberals do not defend capitalism on grounds that some people *deserve* more income than others. In fact many neoliberals (though certainly not all) are very much in favour of minimizing what we call consumption inequality (which differs from wealth inequality because it is decidedly in the interest of society if investors are allowed to keep investing).   In Scandinavian countries, we have a habit of redistributing incomes and making tax exemptions for certain services. This is a pretty good approach and you can see how it works with regards to making living sustainable for everyone (well, almost everyone - Scandinavia has an extremely grim side as well that is rarely seen but that's another discussion)   Now, neoliberals do happen to span a very broad spectrum and differ a lot with regards to what they think about helping the poor, but the kinds of neoliberals I am in the interest of defending will tell you that a healthy economy does not require huge inequality in living standards, and that redistribution and social safety nets are actually often helpful as they allow people to take risks and become entrepreneurs without risking having to live a very hard life if they fail. Poverty, in other words, is not a necessity in a well-regulated capitalist economy; it is rather the property of lacking regulation which largely stems from the particular kind of regulation needed seeming undesirable and making for a poor political platform.  Let's examine this latter claim for a moment: What sort of regulation is needed for a prospering economy wherein people can work minimum wages and still live in decent apartments, support their family, eat decently, and have adequate healthcare? Well, since too high minimum wages are harmful to economic efficiency, this will need to be achieved at least in part through redistribution, such as via a universal basic income or a negative income tax - a welfare state, in other words. Now, as we all know, a welfare state is extremely expensive and the money has to come from somewhere. Ergo, we need to remove corporate taxes and capital gains taxes, raise VAT and income taxes *a lot*, and make people pay more environmental taxes and property taxes. It would take a while to explain why this is the proper approach, but for quick confirmation you can use Google and confirm that this is indeed the Scandinavian model. Considering the optics though, it is easy to see why it is hard to implement a welfare state in the USA.  TL;DR: You're exactly right in wanting to redistribute the champagne, but this can be done within a capitalist economy, and in fact it ought to be. Don't redistribute investments (ie. taxing the capital gains of the elite), don't even redistribute labour (ie. subsidies, minimum wages, income taxes without exempting services), but do redistribute the champagne (consumption tax, property tax, basic income). Everyone deserves champagne.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Just a comment on Maoist China:  Mao Zedong was actually a war hero and brilliant military strategist who repulsed the invading Japanese during WW2, and overthrew the corrupt Nationalists to set up Communist China.  But in terms of Economics, his policies were a disaster. One prime example was Mao's policy on Partridges. He literally commanded everyone to slaughter Partridges on sight, because allegedly Partridges ate the rice harvest.  Tragically, Partridges also ate locusts, so with all the Partridges all slaughtered there were no predators to keep the Locusts in check. As a result, swarms of locusts destroyed the rice harvests over a number of years in China, leading to great famine that caused millions of deaths during 'Mao's Great Leap Forward'.  It was Deng Xiao Ping, Mao's immediate successor...who endeavoured to bring in Foreign Investment and Foreign run factories, and allowed Chinese to slowly run small businesses that China's economy began to recover. I.E slowly reviving capitalism in China help China become the Powerhouse it is today. But as the quality if Life increased in CHina, morals and ethics amongst Chinese went down...so the trouble with Capitalism is...when used properly Capitalism can lift people out of poverty and better economic circumstances, but Capitalism can also result in greed and materialism that erodes the moral fabric society is built upon.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"A couple points I wanted to argue about:   1. Income inequality, the wealth disparity; whatever it is, is really irreverent. If there are 8 slices of pizza, it would not matter who gets the money; 8 slices isn't going to feed 10 people. Whether it's a shortage of tomato sauce (tomatos, herbs, etc), or the dough (wheat), or the cheese (Milk, cows, etc), the BEST thing we can do to feed the 10 people, is to provide the extra ingredients, give more land to the farmers, give them better tools, etc.   2. Capitalism actually is very old, as old as agriculture, because humans are naturally lazy. In a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, food was caught/picked  on the day it was consumed; the prospect of being 'rich' in the future wasn't as good as enjoying life in the moment. It takes additional incentive to get people to save up, like if we know that it's going to be a bad winter, or that the herds are migrating.  Nature was the first at introducing scarcity, which made us start farming in the first place. But because we settled and farmed, we were vulnerable to attack by other groups (or animals), The natural response was a militia. Who paid for the militia? Farmers.. and by force.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Capitalism is great. It creates a system where competition breeds the best outcomes. It helps ensure under-served markets are catered to. It lets individuals determine where their interests lie, and spend their resources on those things instead of everyone getting the same stuff. It creates hard workers who earn their better pay. BUT. It doesn't do that when left alone. Capitalism cannot be the only system in place. Free markets cannot be allowed to run themselves. 'Anything goes' does not work. You needn't even watch this video to come up with examples of how unchecked Capitalism makes everything go tits-up. But it's the most sensible system, it aligns with our innate ideals that effort breeds success. But the world we live in is not compatible with unregulated markets. IMO, Andrew Yang has it spot on. Healthcare should not be a constant worry and something only working people get. Even looking at it economically, when someone lets their medical problems go unchecked, they end up costing more than they would have if we just gave them the care they needed, no questions asked. Money-earning should not start at $0. We have this amazing country where we're more prosperous and advanced than any civilization in history and the fruits of our collective labor have developed all sorts of technologies that will make the future so much better for everyone, but our vision of 'better' needs to include the people whose hard work is displaced by those technologies. That's not some dreaded evil, it's a natural progression of society, a move from a world where everyone has to put their 40 hour work weeks in just to put bread on the table, to maybe one where we have 24 hour work weeks, people get to spend time with their families, the prospect of losing one's job (and therefore extra income) is not a disastrous threat but instead a real option. We need a world where artists and big idea people get a chance to contribute their own skills that don't fit under the structure of soul-sucking corporate ownership of their lives. We need a world where the massive corporations with tons of power aren't calling the shots in every way.   Capitalism is a necessary component of a successful society. I truly believe we cannot simply discard it, or we lay the groundwork for our own demise. No matter how we distribute the wealth, no matter who we entrust all the power to, there are fundamental flaws in a system that does not place incentives for individuals to contribute their very best. But we are swiftly reaching a point where having every able-bodied person doing their best is completely unnecessary. Soon human labor will be about as relevant to the market as horse labor. We'll still have some jobs people will always be better suited for, and we'll always need the best and brightest working on the technologies and innovations of tomorrow (and educating the children who will one day replace them) but your average Joe toiling and sweating over a hot grill is doing a worse and less efficient job than a machine would. Steve drifting in and out of consciousness as he reaches hour 11 of driving his truck across the country to deliver a load of fidget spinners is far more costly and dangerous than a self-driven truck. I think a lot of the ills of capitalism are solved when we introduce other ideas. Elements of socialism, a safety net of UBI, free healthcare... sure, some people at the top will earn less for it. Let them cry into their gold-plated yachts about it. Nobody (who's even slightly realistic about it) is saying their wealth needs to be straight-up redistributed or that their important job needs to earn as little as my simple one does. Frankly, I don't see how a system like that doesn't just crumble. But if we keep the incentives, let people earn vastly more and control most of the wealth they earn, but raise the minimum earnings level up to a livable wage and make necessities available universally, we would have a much, much better country to live in.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"So, in the off-chance you get to see this: You did ask for feedback on economics and why capitalism is good.  Capitalism is the free exchange of goods between consenting individuals. That's it. It's just the way you can trade with a wine maker for his production, or with a butcher for his meat or... with a gold-nail-maker for her gold nails?  Point is: It's not a system designed to keep others down, steal other's people property or anything. Quite the opposite, in fact. It's about cooperation and figuring out how we can maximize our own happiness through individuality. We must seek our own happiness by ourselves. It's the recognition of self-ownership, private property and peaceful, consensual trade among people. To be honest, I'm all in for smashing the State because it is not the support for capitalism, but the very thing choking it! (Anarcho-capitalists are a thing. I'm one of those.)  We could keep this going but this will turn into an effing essay. I'll just say that I do think labels such as leftist and right-winger are severely outdated and barely have any relevance anymore. I'm more in favor of a spectrum between individualism and collectivism. All that said, hope you're having a good one! :D","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"To quickly address a point in 15:30, capitalism with movies. Movies are art. Movies are expensive. Artists need investors and big companies with all their VFX and sound teams, camera crews etc. People who invest the money get a say in the art. Art turns to a design by committee, art by committee has always, and always will be, horrible. On the other hand, the solution to this is capitalism. Investors that shove their ignorant and uneducated input into the art and ruin it will lose their money. It's a big dilemma. The problem isn't really capitalism (since that is the solution), the problem is a lack of trust and the inability to take a risk by not forcing art to be made by a committee and instead follow the artists' vision. Look how Game of Thrones blew up to be an international success. That was not art by committee, David & Dan shared George R R Martin's vision passionately, what we got was art that is completely faithful to the original artist's work. The result? So much fucking money it's hard to comprehend.   The problem all the YouTubers have with this is the value of something comes from its usefulness. A PS2k gold pizza? It will rot, it'll last a few hours before going cold. The value is very low. A PS69.99 stand mixer for someone who makes bread dough for pizza and bread every other day? The value of the mixer is high. A PS69.99 stand mixer for someone who bakes only a few times a year? The value of the mixer is very low, probably only around 20% of the RRP. What is a PS2,500 gaming set-up with VR that you can only use for two hours a day, compared to a PS1,000 set-up you built over 5 years that you can use six hours a day?   Capitalism, as a theory, is ethical and great. Capitalism, how it played out in Human history, resulted in exploitation. Because of globalism, modern economies can exploit underdeveloped economies with sweatshop workers. Unfortunately, it's hard to fix this. If your cotton t-shirts were made by people paid a living wage that affords them the luxuries we can get in our system, then the people working unskilled labour with low wages will struggle to afford them. In the UK, the supermarket Morrison's (somewhere around 15-30% of market share in the supermarket industry?) sell milk and butter that is identical to other milk and butter, but costs more, with the extra money you pay going towards the farmers who produce the goods. The solution to all of your PS1.80 T-Shirts made in Bangladesh? I don't know either, but look at Fairtrade for cocoa. Fairtrade isn't infallible and still has issues, however, if you brand your T-Shirts as being made from people paid a fairer wage, you'll allow people to actually have the choice of not contributing to sweatshop labour, or at least, give the conditions to allow sweatshop labour become more tolerable for the sweatshop workers.   The solution to all these problems? Genetically engineered catgirls.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Since you asked for it, here it goes... I will not answer every single one of your points because frankly I can't be asked.  But I will answer some on your main points and give a general vibe of why capitalism is not some crappy economic system where we only care about profit, or the least evil of all evil systems. But rather actually is THE GREATEST SOCIAL IDEA TO HAVE EVER BEEN THOUGHT OF. And you might just find, that you are already more capitalist than you realize.  First things first, if you are going to argue against capitalism, it would at least be nice to give a concise definition of what you consider capitalism, because guess what, different people have different interpretations of capitalism. Even the word capitalism itself is problematic, since socialists such as karl marx and Lois Blanc heavily influenced its definition.   So let me give you the definition of capitalism that I will be advocating for in my comment. When I say capitalism, I simply mean a system where you are freely allowed to do what you want as long as you do not violate other peoples rights.  So here is a bit of irony for you, if a bunch of workers want to come together and form a means of production where said workers own said means of production, guess what, that's capitalism baby, since you are not violating other peoples rights.. In fact, in a way, we already have such a a means of production under capitalism, its called a cooperative, and its perfectly capitalist. The problem comes when you want to steal said means of production from another owner and claim it for the workers, because here you have violated the original owners rights.   Under capitalism, if you want to buy a piece of land, and build you perfect socialist utopia there, go right ahead, I'm not going to stop you. Plenty of people have tried by the way, and all of them failed.  Now let me ask you this, can I do the same under socialism, can I buy a piece of land, and try my perfect capitalist utopia? In fact, If I don't want to have any part of you socialist nation, can I opt out? Can I say, I don't want to participate?  Now to address some of your points: -The worth it boys are one of the most PRO capitalist works ever produced, because they show that value is subjective, just because you can't see the value in a gold pizza, doesn't mean someone else will. For example, I value getting my fingernails at $0, there is absolutely no value in it for me, and I would not even pay a penny for it. However there obviously is some value in it for you, you value getting you fingernails painted, and that's fine. So to answer the worth is boys question, IS IT WORTH IT? Depends on who you ask.  - Karl Marx's theory of value is correct, for him and his followers. But it is not the way I value things. VALUE IS SUBJECTIVE! So using that as a rational to prove your point is irrelevant, since I will never agree with it because I value things differently to Mr Marx. There simply is no universal truth of value.  - You like shiny things, Congratulations for disproving Mr Marx.   - Using 'I like things' as your first economic axiom is flawed, because again value is subjective. What about the monks who reject all worldly possession? How do they fit into you economic theory?  - You are right, that buying expensive things you don't need will not make you and most people happy. I would certainly not recommend it as a path to happiness. However, it might make some people happy, you can't speak for everyone. Also, I would say this is a problem of psychology not capitalism.  Some things are inherently rare, and humans like rare things out of some reason and therefore it is more expensive, you can't blame capitalism that humans like rare things, that's all  Darwin's fault.  - You want to get really efficient at maximizing human happiness, inject everyone with dopamine, there you go problem solved. Happiness is overrated anyway.  - The economy should not serve anything, because it can't, the economy doesn't have agency to serve. It is simply a word we use to describe humans interacting on a macro scale. You are basically saying, shouldn't humans interacting with each other on a macro scale to serve peoples happiness. That makes no sense. Stop thinking of the economy as a computer we can reprogram, and more as an ant colony we are observing.  Get some of the more obvious objections out of the way: from a capitalists perspective:  -Income inequality exists... because of work harder...  Often said by many right wingers who do not understand capitalism. No income inequality exists because of supply and demand, some types of people are high in demand and low in supply, such as computer scientists, engineers, physicists and yes CEO's. Other people are high in demand, but also extremely high in supply such as Care workers, Phone line operators and sweatshop workers etc. Then there are the worst of people that are low in demand and high in supply, I think you can think of a few.  How hard you work has ZERO to do with it. However having said that, harder working people tend to be high in demand and low in supply. Also a lot of the jobs that are high in demand and low in supply are that way precisely because they require hard work (its not easy to become a physicist), but not every job which is the reason why you get those self entitled celebrities and you think 'How the hell did they get so rich?'  Anyway, I can't be asked to go on anymore, I hope you take some of what I said to heart even if you don't agree with it. This is just the tip of the iceberg by the way. I encourage you to fall down the rabbit hole and research it further.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"If the rich just hoard the money and never spend it, what is it worth then? Nothing.  If they would simply start sharing their money, what would happen? The value of the money would drop. Would the people start producing more and consuming more? Perhaps, and partially to their own harm, but there would be no significant change in how the system works.  Why there are free people (not slaves) who are poor, even in countries with cheap or free of charge education? Because they don't produce what other people need (in a sufficiently efficient way).  If the rich people would use their money to try to change the humanity and make a better world, what would happen then? Nazi-fascistic-Communism.  If the poor people would use their power to try to change the humanity and make a better world, what would happen? Communist-fascistic-Nazism.  And yes, a communist country ruled by the one and only all-controlling party with monopoly over everything is extreme capitalism. Note also how quickly and easily a communist regime can turn into Nazi regime, start wars all around them and lose them all in the end (hint: Serbia 1989-1999).  What is the source of problems if it's not the capitalism? Corruption in the broadest sense, including monopoly and shutting down the competition in illicit ways. Including moral decadence, especially of the kind 'if I can make fools of other people or even enslave them then I'm really smart'. Vanity.

"I think income inequality isn't the prime driver. In the capuchin monkey example, I think the monkey may be more upset that he doesn't have a cucumber than that the other monkey does, and the first monkey knows that there are cucumbers out there to obtain. To check this, I would guess that if you give the first one 5 and the 2nd one ten, neither will be very upset at all. In other words, inequality is only a problem if it necessitates scarcity for some. Granted, fulfilling everyone's basic needs may make it near-impossible to create such gargantuan levels of inequality as currently exist, but if by some caveated fair process someone was able to accrue a billion dollars in wealth in a system where everyone at least got what they needed at a minimum, I don't see a problem with this. I might be surprised at it happening, but at that point it's simply an acceptable byproduct of a that allows the creation of post-scarcity-enabling conditions in the first place.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think the argument from diminishing returns of wealth/income on happiness is a good one.  A criticism of this video series, from the same 'happiness research' angle, is that it promotes ingratitude, which is very bad for happiness. (The term isn't meant to imply that there is anyone to be grateful *to*, so basically what happiness researchers who use it mean is 'appreciativeness'.) Consider how insanely rich the poorest Americans are today; at least the ones who have housing. It's awe-inspiring. People under the American 'poverty line' enjoy luxuries the kings of France could never have dreamed of. That doesn't mean the disparities between people are fair, or that they don't matter.

"The 2000 dollars isn't gone, it exchange hands from the hand of the payer to the producer and the seller, and if the waste is people working on the pizza or the gold on the pizza I have this to say: gold is valuable because people want it, it can produce technologies and apparently pizza but if you dump a ton at the sea no actual lives will be lost until we are out of gold and there are technological consequences, and if you are feeling sorry for the people who worked for making the pizza I think its safe to say they got alot of money for something they had no use for so they are good, and if you think you are the victim, why?, what did you lose in the exchange of the pizza, does the rich pizza mean you had no normal pizza left?, does the existing of the restaurant mean another restaurant at the same location that could help you doesn't exist? maybe, but as you mentioned, there are tons of restaurants and stores, the shortage in our advanced time is generally not accessibility but products themselves, how much space did that restaurant take that could be used for agriculture or production of something 'usefull' (I will stop right here because such a question can be answered with an entire book), to avoid it lets indeed agree with ContraPoints: we want shiny things, so the pizza isn't the problem, so lets go back, the problem according to ContraPoints is that people aren't happy, but is it capitalism? lets remember ContraPoints mainly pointed out that unhappiness in capitalism is mostly inequality and that she wants shiny stuff, so lets assume we are somehow in a communist society with shiny stuff, will people be happy, that's it?, is there no chance that unhappiness also comes from the density of the city, or that people spend their times mostly in their home because computer,phone,jobs,videogames,movies. all I am saying is what you are saying about past communist regimes that failed, if x failed while y existed, y isn't necessarily only/directly/remotely caused x to fail, and as long as you give yourself the benefit of the doubt about communism being a cause of hunger, don't blame capitalism for unhappiness.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

All the problems that you mention on yout video can actually be 'fixed' inside capitalism, like distribution on wealth or power in economic relations.   2- Most of the Marxian Economic Theory isnt functional. Use and Exchange value are useless in the way to operateas well as the Labor value theory(problem of tranfomation, how get prices from value).   3- According to the Marxist theory, you should consumpt as many products as possible with bigger organic composition of capital to acelerate the fall of capitalism.   4-Capitalism is really efficent in order to maximize the resources and services, but it totally depends on the framework where its working, how you deal with externalities, monopolies, r>g, and many others market inefficiencies","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'The problem is capital itself.' Nono, the problem is just a bit deeper. Capital is supposed to represent work. Work is required to grow food, the inescapable truth is that human need exists, we have very basic needs, not just desires, and sometimes we have to make the choice between our needs and someone else's needs.

"I'm going to leave some comments and arguments, even though I doubt any of this will ever be read considering this video is 10 months old at this point.  1. 12:45 The problem here is that janitorial work is unskilled work not just due to its importance (I will go into what 'importance' should really mean in this discussion) but due to how easy it is to replace a worker. Anyone can be taught how to clean in a relatively quick time, so a cheaper, less costly worker could easily be found if a current janitor demanded higher wages. Alternatively, executives and doctors are highly paid because it is far more costly and difficult to find someone else with an interest in the job, train them (often through years of education and experience), and then see how they work out. On a more traditional argument, the importance of a job is also key. For example, a sweatshop worker is not all that important. Once again, they are easily replaced, but furthermore, their job does not hold a position of importance in their workplace or industry. Their actions and beliefs do not really impact the greater company. I have no doubt that people will argue about how 'corporations are built on the backs of unimportant workers', but I think that idea ignores that each individual worker is, in themselves, unimportant. It's why one person will get fired if they miss work, but a whole bunch of people can successfully strike. In contrast, an executive or doctor is extremely important to their organizations. Executives are high-level managers who make sure a company operates correctly in a number of different ways, which gives them a lot of importance; if an executive messes up, an entire company could feel the consequences. Thus it becomes important to treat executives nicely, in order to ensure that the position attracts, and keeps, the very best a company can get.  2. 10:22 and 11:07 I agree with the assertion that there is a certain level of income which allows people to reach peak happiness. I also agree with the idea provided that it is due to families being able to pay off debt, rent, education, food, and all sorts of other bills and costs. I don't think, however, that income redistribution, which seems to be the most common tool of non-capitalist economic systems, is the answer. The better answer, in my opinion, is that more support for programs that provide basic resources such as food, water, shelter, as well as reductions in the cost of education would be a better method. This would allow an efficient system to be set in place that allows people to survive comfortably but still pressures them to work hard and contribute to society in order to fulfill any luxury or additional pleasures they want. The US does however already have a system like this in place, but I am willing to concede that it could be bolstered.  Once again, though, I disagree that income redistribution - specifically: taking money from the rich through extremely high taxes and giving that money to programs for the poor - is the answer either. A better answer to bolstering a system of basic resources would be to make government spending more efficient so that it spends less on military and 'secret budget items'. I think this would not only incentivize the government to be more efficient and open about its budget matters but would also promote the greatest public good by helping the poor without hurting the rich. It is also a system that heavily favors individual responsibility, which is a very important concept people need to be kept to.   3. 11:25 I completely agree with this idea, even if our conclusions are different. I think that one of the biggest parts of the whole socialist movement is envy. Some people have everything while other people have less than everything (not 'nothing', because that isn't true for people who don't actively deal with hunger, starvation, disease, and war), and it seems to make those with less angry at those who have more. That isn't justified, it's selfish. If you want more money because you think it will provide you with happiness, then go out and earn it. Construction jobs pay very well. If you want happiness, realize that money most likely isn't what you really seek, and go find a career (ahem, this sort of addresses an argument from the first video) that you actually enjoy and find meaningful.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The system there is socialist. Socialism is not taxing the rich. But making sure no one gets rich beyond reason. No one in Mondragon makes more than 35 times the average workers' income. Look it up and wonder what it would be like if Apple, Amazon, GM, Toyota,... were modeled like it.

"I have a couple problems with what you argued.  First with exchange versus value. Yes there are products in which the use value, or economically the marginal utility does not match the price. But this does not apply to all people. For some, the utility of a 2000 dollar pizza comes explicitly from that price. But beyond that there's another solution. Don't buy it. Capitalism's assumptions come from people acting rationally. Yes, people do buy things and regret it because they find the use they got from the product was not worth it. But the solution is to better one's financial decisions in order to act more rationally. Capitalism assumes rationality because people tend towards these rational decisions. If someone regrets buying something, they're rarely gonna do it twice.  In terms of distribution of wealth for human happiness, capitalism still arguably does that well. How? Well yes happiness scales with wealth until a certain point, but wealth is ultimately meaningless. See the value of wealth comes from what that wealth can buy. And capitalism's incentive toward bettering production improves what people can buy.  The major thing I'd like to stress is that money is not a consumable resource. Money is exchanged. When you buy the 1000 dollar pizza, the money goes to the company that made it. It is then split between the workers, the supply production for more pizzas, and yes, the CEO. But when these people receive their paycheck, this money doesn't go away. It's fed back into the economy.  So when people get their paychecks, assuming it's disposable income, they either save or spend (Non-disposable income is always spent.). The spent money goes to others and is cycled through the economy as previously described, fueling more production, lowering the cost of production through creation if capital, allowing more people to buy things to raise happiness. Money also goes to workers, letting them buy these products.  But what if the wealthy save, ruining this cycle. As their mountains of cash build up, wouldn't it stop this cycle? Well, money not spent is essentially useless pieces of paper. It's almost as if you burnt the money.  Now removing money from existence deflates that currency. Deflation for an economy is bad because deflation encourages more saving since money is worth more in the future than now, increasing deflation more, and less money is being used in the exchange of goods which lowers happiness since people can't buy things because they're expensive compared to the value of their currency.  But here's the thing, if your economy has a central bank that prints money to regulate inflation like many capitalist economies, like the US, do, than this isn't much of an issue. Maybe you could argue that hyperinflation may occur if all of the wealthy spend their mass amount of saved money all at once, but this doesn't happen for multiple reasons. First the central bank can react to increasing inflation and decrease the amount of printed money. Second, it's ultimately against the best interests of the wealthy since it would lead to recession and hurt their means of income. Third, it's unrealistic to expect this sort of spending without warning.  And ultimately it's in the best interests of many of the wealthy to spend rather than save. While it might seem like CEOs are the boss, they are at the whim of their investors. And investors don't care about wealth accumulated, they care about increase in revenue, which only comes from the purchase of capital.  Those investors gaining money can now invest in more companies, leading to the purchase of more capital, the creation of more companies, and more increased production. (They can also spend it on consumption or save it, which I already mentioned)  Now there are problems with capitalism like markets where demand is incredibly sloped like in Medicare, or effects that hurt society, but not the individual, like climate change and pollution. But that's where government regulations come in. Some of these regulations even come in the form of creating new capitalist markets for a limited number of permits.  While capitalism does have wealth inequality, that doesn't matter if the standard of living stays higher than any socialist nation through how much capitalism incentivizes productivity.   Nonetheless, this was a very entertaining video, keep doing what you're doing. :)  EDIT: I wrote this entire essay on the value of capitalism in an economy and ended it with the wrong your.

"It's easy to criticise a system and point out flaws in it. It's a lot more difficult to construct a better system that works in practice and not just in theory. As they say 'the road to hell is paved with good intentions'.   Now that you have pointed out a lot of the flaws of our current capitalist system can you also explain how a communist regime would solve any of those problems while avoiding the pitfalls of past communist regimes? Can you perhaps do a similar review of the flaws of communism? Obviously there are a huge number of communist theories out there but then there are also a huge number of different capitalist and hybrid systems that could be implemented.  I certainly don't think that capitalism is the best economic system imaginable. But changing economic system isn't something you should do without being absolutely certain (and ideally there should be a broad consensus among relevant experts on this) that what you're doing is an improvement because it's going to effect millions if not billions of peoples lives. At the very least you should try it out on a smaller scale before you try to implement it in society at large. Reality is incredibly complex and just because something works in your head that's no guarantee that it actually works in real life.  Plus isn't the whole difference between communism and democratic socialism that democratic socialism is, you know, democratic? Granted current Democratic Socialist parties in Europe are more hybrid regimes than purely socialist ones (because it didn't work out so well for them when they tried being more purely socialist) but still.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"13:08 LOVE THIS.   But also here's some more info on Jonas Salk, to deepen interpretation of his actions and also further prove your point about accessibility, innovators, and fuck capitalism: 'Adminstrative powers above Salk (his involvement is unclear) determined they could not legally patent the vaccine, given previous works. Still, three vaccine shots and a booster priced polio protection only within the reach of middle class Americans and above.  So infection rates dropped among demographics that could afford the Salk vaccine, while rates expanded in lower income communities, especially among under-served minority groups. This was an economic as well as access problem: pediatricians could command higher prices as there was high demand for the multi-course regimen.   Dr. Albert Sabin, another polio researcher, knew that Salk's vaccine was not the best possible solution or even sufficiently safe. His arguments for impartiality and caution were largely ignored by the council backing Salk's vaccine (see link below), yet Sabin labored on. He developed a single orally-dosed drug that allowed low-cost, wide-scale distribution of this life-saving treatment. [...]  Of course aspects of Sabin's work were built off the work of Salk - all of science is inherently iterative. But we as a community and society at large need to have systems in place to ensure credit is given where credit is due. Thanks to a half-century of good PR and first-mover advantage, Dr. Salk is heralded as the vanquisher of polio, while it was Sabin's dogged persistence at achieving a better solution that tipped the scales (not to mention countered an economically and racially-biased course of treatment).  There is an entire subset of scientists who passed through history largely undetected, while making tremendous impacts. Female scientists have made up a disproportionate amount of this subset, routinely discouraged from research (e.g. see comments in this post). For every triumphant Salk, there is almost always a Sabin (or Rosalind Franklin, et al) who deserves equal if not more recognition. Hopefully with improved access and documentation, the scientific community can better allocate credit, resources, support, and realize improvements faster.' - Source: URL","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

If I went to school and got bullied for being a nerd for two decades while my peers goofed off, I don't mind laughing at them from the top of my office building now that they're getting by and I'm (relatively) rich. Could we make a system where half my income was given to them because I sit in a chair all day while they do backbreaking labor in the sun? Probably. Do I think they deserve it after choosing poorly their whole life? Not particularly. Do I think they should have some means of making up for their past poor decisions nowadays? Yes.  Things that are more expensive are supposed to represent more value. People that are paid more are more valuable people. If a society values the wrong things then it needs changing, but at its core this system of rewarding people who produce the most valuable goods and services with more value-certificates (money) is probably the best. Those external systems that rely on government funding for unbiased research, social programs, and the other things should still exist, because the game of Monopoly is no fun when everyone is too poor to play, but on the whole it doesn't deserve abolishing.

"The problem with being against a system of governance or economics is that it's not enough to be for example anti-capitalist, you have to be pro-something in its place for any of the points to be applicable and not just basically indirect violence mongering, how do you tear down a system with no actual political plans or at least understanding how the fucking thing works? Idiotic activism where you inconvenience people going to work by marching in inconvenient places and smashing stuff, it's moronic and it becomes stuff like 'punch a nazi' where you just hit people you disagree with while Mr. Monopoly, the guy who you are actually against, sits in his ivory tower laughing at you while embezzling money from the poor.

But it's kind of hard to hook you up with a supply of champagne bottles, especially because ever once in a while you also want stuff like food and clothes. So what if, instead of giving you champagne bottles, we give you money and you get to decide how you're going to divide that money into champagne bottles and food. Also, the more you go out and fulfill other peoples needs, the more money we give you, which you can spend on getting your needs fulfilled. Now we have an incentive for people to go out and help people, not only that, but an incentive to help people in the best way they can. Imagine there's a doctor shortage in California. For whatever reason, being a doctor simply isn't appealing to the Californians. Because of this, the doctors are undermanned and overworked. There are also a lot of patients not getting treatment. Basically, everyone is suffering. Now imagine that there's a guy in New York, who wants to become a doctor. He also wants to become rich, because he likes stuff. So he looks around and sees that being a doctor is much more worthwhile in California than New York and decides to become a doctor in California. Because of money. The local doctors however are finally getting relieved and the Californians are finally getting treatment. The doctor is feeling great as well, because he is getting rich. Everyone is happy now, because the doctor wants money.  This is basic supply and demand, which you haven't even touched on in your video.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"If you seriously want to understand economics you have to study...(Surprise!) economics, and not just read Marx in a philosophy class. These videos make it very clear you've never taken ECON 101. I mean, you're not totally wrong - like Marx, many of your criticisms are valid, but your understanding is shallow and woefully incomplete. And just like Marx, your comprehension of how the world actually works is based on false assumptions. For example, money is merely a tool we use to measure resources and cannot be eradicated in even a totalitarian society. And the same goes for capitalism, black markets will always arise, because 'capitalism' is merely the right to conduct business. It's not the boogy-man that Marxist/communists think it is. Is a 9 year old setting up a lemon-aid stand an evil capitalist pig? And with each criticism of capitalism, you've failed to ask 'as opposed to what?' For example, It's easy to say you hate ads, harder to ask if you have the right in a free society to advertise the fruits of your labor, like, say...your Marxist philosophy videos. Or your Che t-shirts. It's easy to say you hate your job at Uber or Comcast, without addressing the fact that you had the freedom to quit and become a youtuber, a job we can assume you enjoy doing. You're only able to name 1 video game produced by 'communism' (less economically free), weighed against millions produced by 'capitalist' societies (much more economically free). There's a reason why no one in the economics field takes Marx very seriously. I highly recommend binging all of Planet Money and reading liberal economists Paul Krugman and Robert Reich.  The TL;DR version is this: There's no such thing as a purely capitalist nor purely socialist economy. It's a completely false dichotomy. The real question is how much do we as a society privatize vs socialize the economy. Oh and also fighting corruption and crony capitalism might actually be a good idea maybe.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There are a few amendments being discussed/tried right now, so our only option isn't Tabby. ;) I'd be curious what you'd think of UBI... the initial results from Finland look good. It's similar to your observation that some of the most important human achievements have been accomplished by people wealthy enough to not have to worry about money. If people's' immediate needs are met, then they can pursue passion projects, which might look like creating art, innovating, or curing cancer.   Also, are you familiar with Peter Joseph? He makes the internet rounds occasionally with some decent ideas about how capitalism could be transformed by technology--things like car sharing, for example, which are starting now, could change how we think about ownership, for example. Why do a need all the expense of owning a car for only my personal use? Wouldn't it just be better if I had one when I needed one?   In general, I guess, although presently there are some huge concerns with how neoliberalism (Uber) abuses the notion, the sharing economy might point towards a way out. Neoliberalism is founded on classical liberalism, which is in turn based in part on contract law (ownership). So then, theoretically, any move away from contractual obligation (sharing) is a move towards the end of capitalism as we know it?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The value of pizza seems to be irrelevant, as in the price. 2000 dollars is specific but that's not what it means, the 2000 dollars doesn't just symbolize something overpriced, it symbolizes the different perception of value amongst people.   It's the same as spending money on Supreme or diamonds. The simple prestige that comes with the ingredients used, a mixed bag of highly valued items considered to be 'delicious'. Being able to spend money on something considered to be high class, it brings pleasure to some people's mind, seemingly casting the illusion of standing above the common rabble with the purchase of a stupidly extravagant item most people can only dream of.   Perhaps, part of the reason why the ownership of commodity is so alluring to some people, that is also partly why some people can commit acts of immorality without any hesitation. That pleasurable sense of dominance that present in that immoral act tempts many and it is also that which disrupts the brotherhood among many of their fellow men.   There are several things we seemingly do not need. A large house, for example, we can live together in a modest apartment, a room each to reduce carbon footing from the excess construction and also save space, reduce housing price, yet we don't.   Living is a simple thing, you consume the necessary nutrient to stay alive after working, if we were to bog down all of our wants (Electrities for tv, drugs, laptops, large house, extravagant meals, expensive hobbies) to our needs, imagine how much money we could have and how much of it could be spent on others living in misery right at this moment. Do the rich fulfill this theory? Do everyone who lusts for the excess do? What will happen if we all choose to live like Buddhist monks?   Are humans inherent hedonist and lust power? Does the centuries of pillaging, conquest, and bloodshed prove this point? Perhaps not. We also lust after other things, love, the desire for meaning, self-sacrifice, and brotherhood. But were they able to overcome the former? Perhaps this is dualism. That men are both of these things at the same time? Or perhaps there are different men for different things?   My last question seems to be, is it then capitalism that made men, or men that made capitalism?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

What happens,  like the majority of people, we accept a half shamble system because it seems to be working and its the best we have got at the moment.

"Here are five myths that cloud our perception of both the past and the present in terms of our judgement of capitalism  (1) The 'robber baron' myth, which holds that in late nineteenth-century America there were powerful men who became rich at the expense of the poor. The reality is that they became wealthy by being productive, and that there is no other period in history which saw such a rapid and widespread improvement in the well-being of the average individual (and you cannot say that communism or socialism did so that is patently false) (2) The myth that the Great Depression (or any other depression of that matter) was caused by a failure of business, when it was, in fact, produced by a failure of government and specifically (in the case of the Great Depression) by the Federal Reserve System (3) The myth that government in the economy has expanded in response to public demand, when, actually, the public has had to be sold 'hard' for politicians to enact every major social program (4) The 'free lunch' myth, which forces the individual to pay more, no matter how the government raises money - by taxing individuals, by taxing businesses, or by printing more money  (5) The myth that government, like Robin Hood, transfers wealth from the rich to the poor, when the reality is that the government usually transfers wealth and income from both the very rich and the very poor to those in the middle.

"So I'm not going to pretend I'm an economist, but I have studied economics and considered changing my major cause I just loved it so much, but I am also a liberal and I love your videos. This is the only one I've ever disagreed with. I'm not going to refute your claims point by point, but I'm going to outline some reasons why I think capitalism is very compatible with liberal values and is good for society.  Here's one: capitalism has built-in incentives against racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. This may sound crazy, but it incentivizes equality and a level playing field in terms of both supply and demand.   On the demand side, everyone's money is just as good as the next persons. Black in the south in the jim crow area, local storeowners would massively inflate prices for black customers, on top of forcing them to wait until every white customer was served. This gave a company who would serve black customers equally, at market rates and quality of service, a competitive advantage. A company, called Sears, did step in to do so who allowed all customers to order through a catalog. When white storeowners tried to destroy the catalogs, Sears even gave out instructions so customers could disguise their orders and drop them directly off at the post office. The competitive advantage that Sears wielded was one factor that put many racist storeowners out of business.    In addition, when companies are revealed to be racist, homophobic, or sexist, customers can boycott them, which is very effective when it comes to pressuring companies to change their stance. In this way, capitalism has built-in tools for self correction when it comes to equality on the demand side. Source: URL  On the supply side, it is beneficial for companies to treat all of their employees with respect and give them as many opportunities as possible to advance. If they do not do so, other companies who listen to all of their employees ideas and recommendations will have a competitive advantage. For example, a janitor at Frito-Lay had an idea for a new product catering to Latinos. Because the company encouraged their employees to think like owners, and the CEO was willing to hear a pitch from a low-level employee, and they provided him the opportunity for upward mobility (basically making the playing field as level as possible for his ideas) they got a fantastic new product: Hot Cheetos, and Richard Montanez went on to become the VP of multicultural sales for PepsiCo America. If they treated him poorly, he might have made his pitch to a different company, and that company will have reaped the benefits of his invention. Or he would have stayed a janitor, but frito-lay would not have as good of a line of products, giving more companies who treat their employees well room to outcompete them. Source: URL  This may seem like just a few people who 'got out of the system' but capitalism works on a macro scale. Some companies will survive even if they are racist. But they won't have the same competitive advantage other companies who value an equal playing field have. However where this begins to break down is when companies become monopolistic and change laws to benefit them, or make the free market 'unequal' by undercutting smaller competitors. This is why we need government to step in with regulations to keep the market free and fair.   Now, why wouldn't this work on an even larger scale? I believe a country to treats everyone equally, who invests in helping disadvantaged people level the playing field, who accepts everyone, who will try to get everyone the best education they can possibly have, will naturally have a competitive advantage over other nations. This is why corporations should be taxed. It will actually be good for the entire country (yes, including them!!!) to do so! Because there will be a more educated, more agile, more resilient workforce, and government can keep them from short-sightedly spending themselves into a depression.  Also I know I said some reasons and this is just one but this comment is way too long already. I have others if you want to make an capitalism apologist liberal character!! I would be honored.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As someone born and raised in Communist Romania in the 80s It's mortifying to see that you condone communism. You cannot even begin to imagine how bad things were - aside from the economical shortcomings of not having things to eat, empty supermarkets, people queueing up to buy chicken feet, no heat, frequent power cuts, 1 hour of television per day,  you had 25% of the population as members of the Secret Services (Securitate) who just snitched on relatives and friends for whomever cracked a joke against the party or the Supreme Ruler. Maybe you have not heard yet of 'Fenomenul Pitesti' - probably the worst tortionary system ever developped where victims became after years and years of sadistic torture, tortionaries themselves made to torture their best friends and family. Those were the years when the New Man according to Communist ideology was supposed to emerge. There is no communist society to have ever been economically successful or humane. From North Korea, Khmer Rouge Cambodia, Eastern Europe, Albania's Enver Hodja to present day Venezuela, communism presented the worst of human beings. Capitalism may have its flows, undoubtedly, consumerism being one of the more prevalent ones, but it has single handedly been responsible for the the world's economic and technological achievement. The communist Eastern block just copied whatever the West was inventing. China opened itself to capitalism (free economic initiative) under Deng Xiao Ping and in the course of 4 decades it lifted 40% of its population from under the poverty line.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I am so, so late to this video, but your point about GDP being an inadequate metric often has no counterpoint by people who instinctively support capitalism without much thought. Personally, I think capitalism could provide the things you're asking for in an economy---but America has never sought to achieve that.   Two distinct strains of capitalism exist, at least from my point of view: pure capitalism, which is the famed 'American Dream' where small business thrives and your employer does give a shit about you because she's at the store every day; or corporatism, which is Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Ford, etc.---the kind of corporations that dominate multinational, multi-billion dollar trade. These both function on the same fundamental ideas of capitalism theoretically, but practically they play out very disparately. There's something to be said of shame, and the majority of people aren't going to eat that golden pizza right in front of starving orphans. Your small business owner can theoretically treat their workers as shitty as corporations do, but they sorta can't because their neighborhood or town or stretch of farmland would be pissed as hell, and their business would dry up.   Adam Smith was right about a select few things and pretty wrong about a lot of others, but one thing he kinda sorta had right was the need for the government to get out of business. Except, not really because regulation is vital to any economy succeeding and deregulation is directly responsible for 2008, but in the sense that there are, again, two kinds of regulation: micro-regulation, which is the government dictating comparatively small aspects of the market or business; and macro-regulation, which is focused on large-scale issues like banking regulations or 'hey don't dump toxic waste in the rivers' or 'hey monopolies and oligopolies actually fucking suck so stop'.   Macro-regulation is absolutely necessary, and without it we see some of the worst distribution of wealth America has seen in almost a century. Deregulation on this front is majority to blame for the economic shit show we have now. Micro-regulation, on the other hand, has created a monster. And it's not the 'fucking red tape' kind of monster, though bureaucracy is its own beast, but when government meddles needlessly with Wall Street, Wall Street will answer in kind. High earners and corporations keep politicians in their pockets and are so blatant about their greed that sometimes the letterheads on top of legislation still has the lobbyist group name on it. Business needs the illusion of mutual exclusivity without it truly being so. The Invisible Hand actually has a fuzzy outline like Wonder Woman's jet, but we all /pretend/ it's invisible because pointing it out wouldn't help anyone and just cause a fit.   I think pure capitalism has redeeming features and encapsulates the best aspects of capitalism as an economic system, but corporatism can burn in hell along with the monopolies of the 19th and 20th centuries and the oligopolies of the 20th and 21st centuries.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Again, weak points. People are not unequally paid,  I feel like you're implying that all people should be paid the same salary regardless of their job because all people are equal, while in reality, while all people should be equal in RIGHTS, people are not equal in many other aspects, some are smarter, some are healthier (mentally too), some are more durable, some are stonger, etc. Some people are just going to naturally produce a better product than others, is it unfair to reward them better than those people who can't produce a quality product because they were born this way? Yeah, I guess so, but you know what? Life is also unfair, deal with. It is also wrong to take those natural privilges from people and giving it to others because that is your perception of justice. It about luck, than eveeeel lizards.  It's also not about working hard, it's about working smart, which is actually harder than just working hard, even a monkey can do a simple task the whole day, but does that mean monkey deservers pay equal to a nuclera physists or someone like that, who've spent multipe years (sometimes up to a decade) to get a degree, studying books and practicing skills day and night, which other people are incapable or/and unwilling to do and rather swipe the floors?  Yes, says the communist, let's pay the same salary to a janitor, a work which requires no academic knowledge. Sounds kinda unfair, doesn't it?

"There must be an incentive for things to be produced, after all the redistribution, who will produce? The only way production will occur once you remove the incentive to acquire capital is through state mandated labor, and we all know how that has gone before. There is nothing wrong with people voluntarily owning, selling, and buying property, the fruit of your labor. Yes hunger occurs under capitalism, but how can you attribute hunger to capitalism when socialism has always made such situations worse (Venezuelans have lost  in average 24 pounds since last year, 90% of them live in poverty), and when capitalism has been introduced it has always lessened the issue (take into consideration the fact that we are facing an obesity epidemic in the U.S). The only places in the world where you see extreme poverty is wherever governments have massive influence in the economy, not where it's more  lassiez-faire. And that's the crux of the issue, the problem isn't capitalism, it's the state and cronyism. The problems you outlined in your previous video (healthcare prices, college debt, etc) are directly caused by this. Would be interesting to see you make a video on libertarianism/anarcho-capitalism (what I'm espousing)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's weird how you think capitalism started to exist at some point. It's the nature of human trade. Capital systems were made because we already traded to get either the highest exchange value or personal value in an exchange. Even in socialist and communist systems, people would privately trade.  I'm not only talking illegal cigarette trade here, I'm talking everyday interaction: I do your homework, I get candy from you. Means, candy is worth more to me than the time I spend while for the other person it's the opposite, we both win. We didn't need some philosopher to tell us this, we just did it, because we both profited from this exchange. And that's why I think capitalism is the natural and ever way of exchange. Because even if we try not to, we can't exceed our humanity and not exchange in our own interest. So if we do that, let's at least have a system that rewards two sided trade.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I'm a leftist myself, a form of anarcho-mutualist and I'm confused what you're trying to say with the points you're raising in your video. Am I misunderstanding you as I interpret your views that everybody should have the same salary?  I can understand that it would be great to only have people actually being driven by passion to study and become doctors but what about us who are more or less driven by higher income. I was a failed carpenter apprentice/store clerk/cleaner and if I could I would have stuck with carpentry instead of spending my valuable time studying this degree in computer science. Knowing that, how would a modern society fill all the work that needs to be filled by academics if we're not offered a better deal at the end of the road? Great scientists might have done significant breakthroughs but their work has also largely been done on the shoulders of a huge number of nameless academics that never got the credit. How many people within actual computer science are famous? Okay OS founders. How about the IT-workers (which is my field)? Can you name a single IT-worker? Yet we still have a significantly better internet that allows for HD streaming platforms like YouTube. A lot of people claim to have a huge passion and that they were always meant for IT because they liked hackers in movies. Personally I just picked it because I wanted to study something in computer science and regular work wasn't working out for me and I doubt all the people in IT has that much passion for it. Probably some interest, but not passion.  I'm often presented by this question myself when talking to other people and if I wasn't getting a good career out of this and the potential to earn more money I might have never even considered university. I'm doing pretty well too so it's not like I'm bad at what I'm doing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I felt like most of what was mentioned fell into either 'Capitalism doesn't do X, which ideally, we'd like it to do' and  'Y can happen under Capitalism, Ideally we wouldn't want Y to occur'. Which doesn't amount to much of a criticism of the inherent properties of Capitalism itself.   We can surely agree that the Ideal system would seek to maximize happiness (even though it is an ill-defined and poorly measurable concept) and wouldn't allow for the current level of inequality. But does that mean that every system that doesn't achieve these ideals is 'bad', per-se?  If not, then I don't see how the case for 'Capitalism is bad' was made with these entries.

"I want to preface whatever I end up writing that economics is a science that deals with maximization of benefits extracted from limited resources. Because resources available to humankind are always limited, be that due to geography and distribution of natural commodities that come with it, labour availability, efficiency of infrastructure and institutions already in place and other important shit.  The thing is, it is really easy to compare the present situation in the US against the utopian version of communism and point to all the failings the American variety of capitalism has. However, there's no certain way to achieve that utopia since the underlying notion of existence of a state-controlled market more effective than a privately-owned one is inherently flawed. Because government-controlled economy is inefficient by the virtue of, well being controlled by the massive and unwieldy organ that is the government. Any government.  Keep in mind that as long as the government is in complete control of the economy, decision-making processes immediately become bogged down with every bureaucratic rigidity that comes with collective decision making of the legislative branch. Time to respond to demand increases to a point where the economic equilibrium (i.e. supply meeting demand) cannot be established, like, ever. Budget is, after all, decided on on an annual basis, so whatever happens in-between has to be tied to decisions made based on incredibly outdated information. Even on local level small and medium businesses have to make day-to-day financial decisions to stay afloat and juggle its funds from one area to another. On global level, unless the entire world is miraculously transformed into socialist countries too, the plans for imports and exports in such a country will clash against a rapidly changing and unpredictable privately-owned international market, so the trade balance is fucked too. Private market provides flexibility to respond to changes in demand quicker, even when that demand is for a two thousand dollar pizza. Which ties into my next point.  Remember that since the legislative branch is in control of statewide market supply across all industries, it can simply disregard human needs it does not deem essential and relocate funds that would otherwise be serving, for example, the entertainment industry, into something like healthcare (yaaay!), or infrastructure (yaaay!), or military (yaaay?), or salaries for the government apparatus (yaaay???).   /Tangent/ It is, by the by, hard to imagine a system with more conflicts of interest than the one where chief business executives and policymakers happen to be the same people. Corruption and embezzlement in the USSR was something of a legend, and it was one of factors that eventually led to all but legally pronounced merging of the executive and the legislative branches of the government. This is a consequence Russia still can't get rid of today, the most notable symptom of which is the fact that Putin, for all intents and purposes, is sitting his fifth term in a country where the limit used to be two consecutive terms (and each four years instead of now six). /End Tangent/   Also remember that since the state will overall have less money to distribute among the industries - because the economy is less efficient - the question of how essential any federal expense is will gradually become more and more important, and therefore even in democratic regimes where the voters decide who occupies the office at any given time the candidates campaigning for those essential issues will be more attractive in the eyes of the electorate. No one will run on promises to invest into films and press - oh, by the way, all press safe for spare-time Internet blogs is state-funded too, that also goes well all the time - when political opponents run on promises to make the pharmaceutical industry great again. So, death to fashion is imminent, you are right about that, but you can also forget about video games, possibly in their entirety. Because people in the government are not exactly young and hip and they couldn't care less for all your young adult interests unless it serves the reputation of the country or re-purposed for money laundering.  Imagine standing in a queue at a shopping mall in the capital to buy, say, a sweater, for four hours, only to find that the state-run shop has run out of sweaters for now, but they have black leather Hungarian shoes and leggings from Romania, and that's all you can buy now, try your luck in a week or two to see whether they stock something you need next time. That's what shopping for anything other than food in the USSR during the eighties was like. The supply just didn't care.  The thing is, you have all the tools you need to fix the situation. Taxes and legislation of the private sector. Tax the rich more to redistribute income (forcefully disassemble monopolies if you need too, capitalism isn't without its sins in that area as well) and keep the companies in check on labor conditions and environmental impact, and any other issues that may arise. Don't allow commercial organizations to lobby via middlemen NCO and make tax evasion difficult. The US has demonstrated time and time again that its institutions are capable of enforcing the laws, so make that law-enforcement non-selective and you'll be fine.  Lots of stuff I didn't mention, but this is long enough as it is for a YouTube comment from a person who is not really qualified to talk so extensively on the topic.  P.S.

"The institutions that create Capitalism: the market, commodity production, private property, etc. predate Capitalism as a whole. I'm not advocating that Capitalism is immortal because it's institutions predate it, but actually a case that we can build pieces of Socialism under Capitalism while we wait for the unholy alliance between the institutions that create Capitalism to fail on their own. Community assemblies, common ownership of key parts of society, and mutual aid, can all be created and function independently from one-another to achieve different goals: positive community cohesion, efficient resource distribution between people, and cooperation to achieve common objectives, all of which, if used independently, can actually benefit and help the working class understand itself and its place in the Capitalist system.  While the market and private ownership prior to Capitalism existed, they didn't cooperate. Under Feudalism, private ownership of the means of production lied within the institutions of governance: the lords and monarchies, and manifested itself as the Manor Economy. Markets existed, but were separate from the Manor Economy, primarily with traders and merchants. Their practices would be the backbone of Capitalist methods of selling commodities for profit: advertising, investment, even banking.  As technology improved, colonization was under way, and trade began dominating Europe (yes, I specify Europe because the West itself is the hub of the Capitalist system. Not racist, because Capitalism is shit. It is what it is) the Manor Economy became irrelevant. The need for self-sufficient communities decreased when a workforce can be hired, or, forcefully imported, to till the fields and operate the tools instead. The colonial-era slave trade played a major hand in Capitalism's rise, with the market playing a big role in the success of this new economy.  This created a problem: the European systems of governance were created and structured in such a way that they functioned most efficiently under Feudalism and the Manor Economy. Once Feudalism began to collapse on itself, it wasn't because the Capitalists rose up and overthrew it, replacing it with a form of State that was structured to organize a society built on a cooperation between the Market and Private Ownership under the decendents of the merchants and traders: the early bourgeoisie. This state is the Representative system. Almost every state today possesses a form of Parliament with political parties vying for control. Even dictatorships, such as North Korea, possess a national assembly (fancy phrase for 'Parliament') with a political body in control. This new system of governance was strikingly similar to the structure of the new economies: political bodies competed for control (similar to how companies on the market compete for profit) with a twist in using propaganda to manipulate the public into support and votes (similar to how companies use advertisement). The Representative State is a Partner, and interweaved, with Capitalism. All key elements to both predate them, but as the preexisting system began corroding away due to its natural contradictions and ever-globalizing material conditions, new conductions would arise for a more flexible form of economics and governance.  Similar to how the German Peasants Revolt of 1524 and the English Civil War saw a new trend heading in the inevitable direction of Capitalism and the Representative system, we see naturally occurring trends (not ideological ones) beginning to flourish showing signs of the system that will replace Capitalism. The early 20th century 'Socialist' revolutions aren't good examples- they were forced, only reactions to ideology, not because of Capitalism itself. The latter half of the 20th century saw Revolutionary Democracy begin occurring naturally, and not ideologically (1968 France, 1994 Mexico, and the Rojava Revolution). The justifications for why these events even happened/are happening is because of contemporary conditions beginning to support their rise: ecological disaster, the corrosion of the current economic order, and cultural suppression by the Representative Nation-State, rather than 'some guy in a book said this system is bad and oppressive'. These revolutions and events happened by nature, not nurture. The YPG was founded as a result of the Arab-centric society in Syria over the Kurds in 2004, not because Socialism was more appealing. They only began building an ideological platform after their formation, and a platform they saw would fit the needs of the people in that region. Same with the EZLN in 1994.  I wouldn't go so far as to call these movements 'Socialist', however. The Rojava still maintains several institutions of Capital. I would instead call it what it is, a phrase I mentioned earlier: Revolutionary Democracy. The primary changes in the Rojava are more oriented towards changing the cultural and political relations, and less about economic relations- councils must have 40% or more of their body be female, policies are made locally, active attempts to integrate all kinds of cultural communities by building a platform capable of sustaining them: which can't be centralized. This is what the new political body will look like after Capitalism, at least a primitive version of it: decentralized and egalitarian.  But what about in the realm of economics? Unions? I think not. Unions are failing, and are a product of existing labor relations: something a post-capitalist system will lack. The labor relations of Feudalism were different, and most certainly the labor relations of a society post-Capitalism will be different.  Cooperatives? A possibility, the amount and success of cooperatives economically and when it comes to integrating their workers as compared to traditional business models is certainly different and beneficial, but if they are what's coming next, they are certainly in their primitive state: still bound by the existing economic order.  I think the fact that these, certainly revolutionary, but definitely not Socialist, at least not yet, institutions actually beginning to form today naturally is a sign that things will change. Capitalism isn't self-sufficient, it requires various institutions and social orders to even function crudely, unlike Feudalism, so it certainly won't last as long as Feudalism did, even though it's wayyy more powerful. So things might be coming around soon enough for the common masses, but definitely not for at least several more decades.  I'm going to end here and let you contemplate what I've said. Please don't trash me, I'm not a political master.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Ok so some economic facts  - capitalism in all its flaws does creat wealth and that distribution can be more even than you think which is why World poverty rates since 1980 have been cut in half. This is to suggest that developing countries with child labor are just that 'developing' and capitalist endeavors prove to be an overall good for the world in this sense.  -There's never a zero sum game in terms of economics and systems that produce wealth. The idea that new wealth only goes to the top is false the portion of the population within the higher middle class and middle class in American has increased 11% since 1980.  -capitalism has its best effects when it is allowed to fun free for instance the cheapest goods in America (things that have actually become cheaper since 1980) are the items least regulated by the government for instance cars, refrigerators, dishwashers, food, and any consumer good you can think of. Americans spend the most money on housing, health care, and education which are subject to massive regulation by federal government via subsidies, quotas, mandates, and zoning laws.  Capitalism isn't prefect but if you think Marx can do a better job for us I will point you at the 20th century ask you if you want to try the Soviet Union again.

"I think capitalism died in the 2008 recession because it died the minds of a generation capitalism mocks every chance given - millennials. If not at the very least the veil has been lifted if only for a second, so it makes you wonder just how fragile capitalism really is. Even on the simplified examples capitalism is a 'supply and demand' system. but if you demand nothing..then...ya know. But of course, that's not possible. But so is sustaining a whole country on all these god damn same 5 stores found in every American town. I guess what I'm trying to say is eat local food and support local small business not because it's the hipster thing to do, but because in some small way you are making it harder for your money to find it's way back into the hands of the already rich.  This leads to my second comment, at what point are you so rich (person) or so fucking huge of a monopoly (company) that people have no choice but to funnel their money into your wallet. People would have to go to extreme measures to avoid giving you their money. You're so rich and big you have become part of...society(?) for example. Real Estate will never fail because people will always need housing. Telecommunication companies can now never fail because society can no longer live without it. You can't erase the existence of the telephone or the internet. Individuals can survive without a phone but not society. These industries are both too big to fail and too necessary to ever revolutionize. At what point have you perfected the art of your trade so well, you are the fucking market. These mega rich families not only can't commit 'suicide' but were they to collapse someone else would quickly take their place.

"Hello I was sent your way by Paul Camplos at Lawyers, Guns and Money (URL Really enjoyed watching your series on what's wrong with capitalism and looking forward to seeing some more of your stuff when I have some time. You did ask for valid critiques of the video/defenses of capitalism so here's mine, with the caveat that I generally agree with most of your points about utility maximization in capitalism.  You address this briefly in your video but it's worth noting capitalism has created the most maximized human environment for innovation in all of human history. You reference prior innovators briefly and note that their motivation for their efforts was contributing to the common weal, not profit maximization, because they were already wealthy. But it can be argued and is probably true that it was a condition precedent to their efforts that such historical innovators were wealthy, which generally allowed most such innovators in human history the independence to pursue innovation for the good of man. Your rebuttal on this point is weak (and I do keep in mind you spent about 10 seconds on it).   The era of Capitalism has unlocked the most sustained and consistent course of innovation in human history. I don't think examples are necessary in my opinion, that statement can stand on its own. In comparison to previous era of human existence innovation for the last two - two and a half centuries has been proceeding at an extraordinary pace, and most of it has been coming out of nations that have embraced capitalism. Historically innovation in pre-capitalist society proceeded at a snail's pace, probably precisely because so few people had the independence necessary to devote significant resources to innovation, and further because the rewards for innovation were less predictable in a society that did not have any meaningfully developed intellectual property laws. It's arguable that the modern era's period of innovation also comes from fully embracing the enlightenment and the scientific method, and people in previous societies were hobbled by poor modes of thought, however it's notable how much innovation has come specifically out of the United States and Britain during this time period and how much of it was profitable, indicating capitalism is playing a significant role.  True socialism does not meaningfully address the innovation component of human activity sufficiently. Classic marxism destroy's significant incentives for innovation that exist in the present system. And halting the process of human innovation would be a tremendous net negative for humanity, one that we need to be mindful of when proposing what should follow capitalism. We need to keep in tact these incentives for innovation and creativity and build a society around forward progress in the sciences, engineering and other high-level forms of human endeavor (art/philosophy/etc.), and disproportionately rewarding people engaged in such endeavors is an important means of doing so (maybe philosophy in the latter half of the 20th century has suffered and fallen into meandering minutia precisely because it hasn't exactly been a money maker (unless you like Focault or the cast you roll called in your video and think they've genuinely been meaningful in comparison to Socrates, Hobbes, Descartes or Marx)).   No answer's here but I suspect in the medium term the goal will be to socialize the bottom rungs of Maslow's hierarchy of needs while creating even more hyper-capitalistic environments for the attainment of the top sections of the pyramid. Some of this is playing out already, independent of dollars social media cred is it's own form of currency and value, though it correlates tightly with dollars most of time. Ideally we should socialize up to love/belonging to create a safer society (reduce anti-social behaviors) but I'm not sure how you would socialize love/belonging or if that's even possible (maybe drugs/robots/VR for the wretched cases?). We can definitely at minimum strive to create entitlements to food/shelter/medicine for all people though, we have the resources or will in the future. Meanwhile innovation will still be highly rewarded with stuff/societal esteem in a continued capitalized/competitive environment for more high-level goods.  Anyway thanks for the efforts, cool video, looking forward to seeing more of your work!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

On the contrary, I was struck by clear signs of its transformation into a hierarchical society, in which the rulers have no more reason to give up their power than any other ruling class. Moreover, the workers and intelligentsia in a country like England cannot understand that the USSR of today is altogether different from what it was in 1917. It is partly that they do not want to understand (i.e. they want to believe that, somewhere, a really Socialist country does actually exist), and partly that, being accustomed to comparative freedom and moderation in public life, totalitarianism is completely incomprehensible to them.         George Orwell, in the original preface to Animal Farm; as published in George Orwell : Some Materials for a Bibliography (1953) by Ian R. Willison  For the same reason any decent socialist (I'm not fully socialist; I mix socialism, liberalism and green ideology, the idea is to be pragmatic and longterm..) should be against say Cuba as the leadership are having it supergood whilst the rest do have a lot less. How could a rich elite represent the people? Why is that I who is supposed to be equal cannot even start my own party? Why is that only recently computers were allowed? Clearly some animals are more equal than others and that won't hold, and of course it should be said that total equality is not ideal either as some do in fact work more than others and therefore deserve more. But do we need to increase the income inequalities for instance. Could the British government skipped austerity after 2008 and instead borrowed money to get through it so that it wouldn't cause mass-suffering and even DEATH?  Austerity linked to 120.000 deaths: URL  And no capitalism won't fully crumble, because the capitalists have bought the government as well, a number that few people have heard is 7.7 trillion dollars. This is what the fed pumped into it to rescue US state capitalism (Chomsky's description is more accurate). Basically privatize wins and socialize losses. Although they had to pay money back, they did it with incredibly low interest, much lower than students can borrow for their studies.. So no true capitalism exists either, because if say USA would implement it then it would quickly be overrun by other states where the state pumps in tons of money into privatize businesses, as this increases their competitiveness.  Notice too that capitalists are perfectly fine with the oppressive system in China, if the workers were to demand  more for themselves, like in rights to form unions the Chinese government would be against it. And that government is not communistic / socialistic either: URL URL If you are a socialist wanting a better society for the people in China you will have a really hard time. Orwell was again right in Animal Farm where he said the difference between the Stalinist and the capitalist is not really great at all. It's as usual the upper class screwing everybody else.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Wealth is created collectively, but privately appropriated. The economy doesn't care where the wealth comes from or goes to. Over time it has allowed for pools of legacy wealth to accumulate and has created a massive imbalance in spending power in the economy leading to the worst off people not having enough income to meet their daily needs. To remedy this, governments could introduce a constraint to the economy that would ensure that a certain portion of money would have to come from individual consumers.

"We don't live in a capitalist society, if by 'capitalism' we mean a system where industry and trade are privately owned. This definition assumes a real separation between the state and private enterprise. What we in fact live in is a fascist system, where governments and the global corporations are united in purpose (at least mostly), and this is true for a lot of the world. The 2008 'Great Recession' illustrates this point nicely. When the private banks gambled irresponsibly and failed, the FEDERAL RESERVE, a government appointed but privately owned bank, created massive sums of money to bail out the banks under the guise of bailing out the economy. Other central banks did the same. This in turn bailed out the private owners of the corporations whose stocks were all plummeting, causing a massive stock market boom that is only now beginning to roll over. Unless we can fully understand the structure of our society, we cannot imagine adequate solutions. Giving the state more power, for example, is no different in our society from giving it less. This is because there is no independent state. Capitalism would in fact be an improvement. Under a capitalist system, for example, interest rates would be set by the market, instead of being set by a privately owned bank for the benefit of the global banking/corporate elite. Remember that normal people are still a large part of the market. A good way to ensure the people have no power is to ensure they are poor and a good way to ensure that is to make saving impossible. Capitalism might be an improvement, but this is not to say I am endorsing an Ayn Rand libertarian society either. A free market requires law and oversight. Capitalism requires a separate state power to regulate it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As someone who studies economics, I am not sure what is meant by anti-capitalist. There are certainly problems with some of the results of capitalism but at the end of the day it is merely a very efficient debt management system which reduces hording and ensure greater employment of resources by allowing for a profit for lending unused resources. I can agree that maybe this extreme employment of resources leads to excess production of useless things, but that is more due to subsidy than capitalism. Subsidy is in many cases a symptom of corruption.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"A good example of a communist economic system is seen in government agencies. The managers of individual units practice budget maximization in order to make sure they get the same or greater amount of resources the following year.

"I completely understand that there are problems with the wealth distribution structure of capitalism in it's current state. However, to throw out the resource management side of the system seems extremely counter productive. Capitalism does make essential commodities much cheaper. It is making these essential commodities so cheap that makes it so the excessive commodities could exist at all. There are some notoriously hard essential commodities that are very difficult to make cheap due to lack of portability. Housing and healthcare are two examples. In these cases a socialistic approach may be helpful but would involve long waiting lists. Would a capitalist system which was made up of  workers cooperatives, as opposed to companies which represent very few interests, quell some of the issues than anti-capitalists have with capitalism?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Just on a side note market access used to be almost impossible before for the average person. Furthermore non-self directed investment schemes like 401ks only give the powerful more power. In a non-democratized market the arguments against capitalism seem much more valid. However, these days if you want to 'own the means of production' save up some money and buy some of it with Robinhood. Will you have as much power as the rich person or institutions in shaping the economy through your investment choice, no. However, if more people actively participate the economy should greater reflect what we want. This type of participation does require a different view to investing than is traditionally used. The institutions have the time and resources to manipulate small investor actions by playing on their greedy. However, I think we will see a shift in power and economic composition as active investing becomes more normalized for even the low-end wage earners.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

This could be addressed by enshrining in constitutions that large wealth (as a percentage above a threshold) can not be passed down to heirs in any form, and instead goes to fund support for at-risk populations in some form.

"I've really come to love your videos over the like, past 72 hours during which I've watched basically all of them for the first time, BUT - ohgod I can't do this.. Let's skip the but.  I've really come to love your videos over the like, past 72 hours during which I've watched basically all of them for the first time. What strikes me as a little bit peculiar in these two videos though, is the seemingly lacking sense of self-irony in regards of capitalism and the lifestyle that your videos could be interpreted as portraying (which is different from saying that it was the lifestyle that you had. Obviously I don't know you - other than for that you like shiny things, but then, who doesn't?). You can take unchecked concern for appearances, sexualism, hedonism and pleasure and combine that with social justice and liberties and equality and present it as superficially something hugely progressive. But under the realities of current availability of resources, under the realities of capitalism, that can only ever be local. Outside our sphere of pleasure someone pays the price of our champagne, costumes, the layers of makeup. That's largely the Chinese factory workers, at the moment. Or if you're really into cocaine, then it's the innocent bystanders of cartel wars and farmers forced to turn their fields, that used to give them food and thus grant them at least a theoretical means of self-reliability, into seas of coca plants.  In my opinion, the best direct action you can take against capitalism and global inequality is to minimize your consumption. This said, I'm not meaning to be overtly critical of you as a person; *even if* this was a flaw of you, one flaw doesn't break the person, but might as well be that it's something you're well aware and also take into account in your daily life outside these videos.  In any case, to me, personally, what actually makes your videos even more charming is that I can interpolate the lifestyle portrayed in them to such an absurd degree that it becomes this dystopia of pink curtains and golden lace and bubble warp made of silk. And I do honestly believe that your style is particularly effective in reaching a certain part of the jaded young generation.

"As a liberal who has studied economics, stuff is not that easily attainable without some form of capitalism incentivizing people to innovate and start businesses to produce stuff. There needs to be natural selection in the market place in order to end up with quality stuff. It works because people figure out what people are demanding and work to satisfy that need with the incentive of profits, which leads to production and a healthy economy. Mass starvation happens in communist countries because people aren't producing optimally because the government is controlling their decisions. Since the government doesn't know what the best decisions are locally for the food producers but still tries to control them, food production suffers (best example of this is China) and GDP is too weak to pick up the slack with imports.   That said, people worrying about starving to death while the rich get richer is bad for a free market too since the rich simply hoard their money while most people are too worried about working so they don't starve to death to start businesses or innovate. People need to feel safe to take risks, so worrying about making the bare minimum to survive or losing health insurance also hurts the free market. There are also things like the environment which nobody is considering when acting optimally for themselves, so you need government regulation to incentivize people not to break the environment.   To maximize well-being, people having the freedom to decide what's best for them works pretty well in most cases, but having a safety net and rules to protect from collective harm are also extremely important. I believe in taxing the rich a lot more and universal healthcare and education, but pure communism is not the answer.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There is a missing linkage in the comments which few communists apparently understand. Yes, companies pursue profits. How does a company offer a service or product at wide enough scale or with wide enough margins to keep the lights on? By meeting demand! A non-corrupt company produces things people actually want and need. The profit motive could never be serviced without actually providing for other people.  No single plan is as adaptive or responsive as the decentralized, organic system we call the free market. There are elements in capitalism which are exploitative or unpleasant, but if you like having your wants and needs met by competent organizations, and if you like a variety of choice, capitalism is for you. If you like one kind of shoe (determined by a planner), one kind of car (determined by a planner) and one kind of pizza (determined by a planner), then please go seastead a communist paradise (there's an oxymoron) into existence.

"So many great points in this video. I wish people would also let go of looking at things as black and white, all or nothing. It's entirely possible to form a society with a capitalistic economy that's tempered by socialist policies, or maybe other polices that come from whatever other 'ism' you please. We don't have to be ALL capitalist or ALL socialist,  we don't even have to use those terms, we can just be a society-with-whatever-rules-we-deem-work-for-us-ist. Honestly capitalism needs a bit of socialism to work anyway, because as much as some people are trying to pretend otherwise it's undeniable that it needs healthy and happy humans to achieve peak performance. Capitalism is supposed to work as a cycle, where businesses employ people and make products, and those workers make enough money and have enough free time to go out and become customers for other businesses, so that those businesses can make money to use to make their products and pay their employees, and the cycle continues. People need to be able to eat well, rest well, and afford healthcare so that they stay healthy physically and mentally enough to perform their work, in order for the business to run well. When people get overworked they'll start having trouble doing their jobs and customers will be affected either by getting bad products or service, or worse - the biggest contributor to the spread of the cold and flu last winter was people coming into work sick because they couldn't afford to miss a shift. So you have a business literally spreading bad health because they're not looking after the health of their own employees on a larger scale. Whether it's because of bad products, bad service, or bad experiences like getting sick from the person who served them, this will cause a decline in customers. So now the business is suffering a fall in the quality it can provide and losing customers too, and they'll usually try to compensate by pulling even more support from employees and cutting corners on their product, and that only lends itself to making the situation worse and worse. Right now we have all these people up in arms to defend pure, unfettered capitalism, as if there is no greater imperative in the world than generating money, but I agree with Contra - what good does it do to raise all that money if it never translates into a better life for the vast majority of people who raised? And in fact in many cases it gets used to lobby politicians and instill policies that not only try to ensure those people never see a return on all their hard work but actually get less and less of it. In the best case scenario it just gets put in some off shore bank account and sits around never being spent, but collecting dividends that the few powerful elite will splurge on all the while never directly using those funds to truly benefit anyone. Is preserving the freedom to just drain the economy and hoard all the wealth that the country collectively generated so that a handful of people can grow fat off of its fruit while everyone else fights for the scraps that 'trickle down' to the people who did all the hard work really a freedom worth preserving? Is it actually moral to preserve all freedom, even the freedom to destroy other people's lives? Historically society has not allowed this, that's why there are laws saying you can't kill people, or steal, or do other destructive things. We've never been free to indulge in just any and all desires and impulses, yet these corporations are trying every day to establish that kind of freedom for themselves as if no harm could come from it, totally disregarding the massive amounts of harm already being done by them WITHOUT that kind of unfettered freedom. People need to stop looking at generating money as the end all be all goal, the only thing that isn't evil. There need to be checks and balances on all human systems so that they don't collapse. Capitalism can't be allowed to grow disproportionately more significant than humanity, they need to work in tandem. Otherwise It would be like putting a jet engine on a tricycle - it wouldn't do any good because the thing would just rip itself apart and be impossible to steer before it crashed and burned, both the engine and the bike. But, you put a small motor like one of those e-scooters or e-bikes have onto it and you have a perfectly functional tryke that's faster and easier to use. You put a jet engine on a jet and you've got yourself a perfectly functional really fast plane. You mesh the two things (in this case the economy and humanity) together in a way that they can support each other and make the most of each other's strengths, and you get yourself a functional society.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"The difference between capitalism and socialism? Capitalism has lots of rich people, socialism has a handful of rich people and lots of poor people. The poorest in American are richer than the middle class 100 years ago. The poorest in America aren't flocking to Venezuela for some weird reason. Our society is not perfect, but it has been a story of continual improvement since the very beginning and it will continue on as such unless people who share your agenda are somehow successful in taking down capitalism (I note, without a functional substitute in mind).  This video should have been called 'lots of strawmen.'  I'll take a page out of your book and give it a whirl- You say the wealth needs to be redistributed. You think the wage gap is real. You think white men occupy a privileged position.  The obvious answer: taking money from men corrects the imbalance, taking money from white people does some work in erasing privilege.  Here's the issue- Men already pay 70% of the tax and receive 30% of government benefits. Women pay 30% of the tax and receive 70% of government benefits. In what world does skewing that statistic further toward women's benefit strike you as equality? Oh, and men work way more overtime on average. Even if job choice were evenly distributed, men would still earn more. Should we try to iron out that imbalance as well? I guess you're suggesting men should just work a lot harder and smile as the tax man hands their money away in ever greater proportions, enforced, as all taxation is, at the point of a gun. Like all dopey American communists, your real answer is to rob white men at gun point (but it's a government gun, so it's ok).  Aren't strawmen fun?  Here's another one for you. The top 0.1% pay 20% of our nation's taxes (at about a 30% effective rate). If you were rich, would you want to pay one half of every dollar you earned to the government (as some do in CA)? Meanwhile, 44% of Americans pay no income tax at all. To put it in extremely harsh terms, why should the rich be forced to subsidize the useless (again, at the point of a gun)? There's a humanitarian argument to be made, but not much else.  There is value in earning things. People who get handed things their whole life, whether by rich daddy, or by daddy government, tend to turn out useless to themselves and useless to the rest of us. In America, it's easier than ever. The death of the university is a good thing! If I have certificates from an online course catalogue indicating competence in differential equations, linear algebra, number theory, topology and so on, an employer will happily hire me to use that skill set. Even a cut-rate data analyst makes way more than a burger flipper and online courses are extremely cheap.  I have a friend who was born into hell. Broken family, drugs and crime everywhere. He himself was arrested on felony charges, struggled with numerous addictions into his early adulthood. He taught himself how to code, no degree. He makes twice as much as I do now (I have a physics degree from one of the best schools in the country). Don't point fingers, don't waste breath blaming others. Work on yourself, build your skills, build your understanding and the world is your oyster. If you have a shitty family, or a shitty school, or you're getting fucked some other way, the best way to get revenge on those you hate and those who hate you is to find success and happiness. Those things don't tend to find whiners and complainers however, and success is outright allergic to communists. (Marx was semi-sane, never worked a real job, died poor)  Definitely try a real job, start a company, or have a real discussion with somebody who has done either. It's easy to write those experiences off from the outside, but for most people (myself included) they are utterly transformative.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Historical point: countries that were based on a communist ideology did many horrible things.  General premise: if any country based on a particular ideology did many horrible things, then that ideology should be rejected  Political conclusion: communism should be rejected.  Now the conclusion follows logically from the premises, and the premises look plausible.  But the problem for the anti-communists is that their general premise can be used as the basis for an equally good argument against capitalism, an argument that the so-called losers of economic transition in eastern Europe would be quick to affirm. The US, a country based on a free-market capitalist ideology, has done many horrible things: the enslavement of millions of Africans, the genocidal eradication of the Native Americans, the brutal military actions taken to support pro-Western dictatorships, just to name a few. The British Empire likewise had a great deal of blood on its hands: we might merely mention the internment camps during the second Boer War and the Bengal famine.  This is not mere 'whataboutism', because the same intermediate premise necessary to make their anti-communist argument now works against capitalism:  Historical point: the US and the UK were based on a capitalist ideology, and did many horrible things.  General premise: if any country based on a particular ideology did many horrible things, then that ideology should be rejected  Political conclusion: capitalism should be rejected.

"It's not about the hardness of work, it's about the scarcity of the skill. Supply and demand. Relative importance is more or less irrelevant. Relative scarcity is what matters.  This creates some incentives that are bizarre, but scarcity can explain them. Not justify, but explain. Value under capitalism is entirely disconnected from utility. I would argue that is good, because it is the most pure expression of democratic ideas: consumers (all of us) voting with our wallets on what should be valued. Which, I guess, is the Kardashians: we, the people, chose them with money. Yuck.  Marxism is thus inherently anti-democratic: it seeks to connect utility and value even when people explicitly do not want them connected. People reject marxism because it takes away choice, even if it might make them happier. People don't want to be forced into happiness, they want to choose their way into happiness, and marxism is antithetical to that pursuit.  Turns out that was a really long explanation of why generals are paid more than janitors and why it isn't really a bad thing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've always been a pretty big fan of capitalism, but your points were very good ones so I will have to think on my stance more. One thing that I do worry about communism is the nature of 'hard work'. And I say this in quotes because I agree that minimum wage workers are incredibly hard workers, but there's a difference between being exhausted by your job itself and voluntarily putting in late nights at your job because you want a promotion. Although I wish to maximize happiness, I feel that a reasonably successful economy requires some degree of stress, pressure, and fear among all employees in order to keep profits up and put more money into the system. If all work was rewarded relatively equally, I know so many people in my personal life who (bless them) would totally slack off. I hate to say it, but the number of people who would abuse a communist system would outweigh the number of people who would put in extra work just out of the goodness in their hearts.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Oh and no economy can bring about happyness. Happyness is a feeling. And like all feelings, they come and go. It is impossible to feel happy all the time and it would probably suck.

"Solution?! GEORGISM. We need to get out of the trite dichotomy between capitalism and socialism.   Georgists agree with socialists that capitalism has failed to reconcile fairness with efficiency.   Whereas capitalist policies increase national income, they also cause extreme inequality.  Georgists agree with capitalists that socialism is inefficient because government monopolies are rarely any better than private monopolies.   Most policies to help the poor by equalizing incomes have the negative side effect of reducing the productive power of the economy.   That is why China and Russia shifted from socialism to capitalism in recent decades.  Georgists believe it is possible to unite fairness and efficiency by taxing away the rewards of privilege so that people can earn money only by being productive.   Since much of the power of modern corporations derives from those privileges, proper taxes could reduce that power.

"So capitalism is good at making lots of things and money. But mostly for people that already have lots of things and money. Proper Government intervention can shift how much of that money goes to people who don't have lots of things and money so that more things and money can circulate in the economy because people with fewer things and less money spend more of what they get than people with more things and money. But the people with lots of things and money are very good at avoiding taxes and if you make taxes too high many of them will move their profits outside the country with or without actually leaving the country. So you need good laws, a careful balance, and not too much corporate lobbying (I think 0 is a good amount). So it is complicated. But with a certain degree of democratic socialism, you can redistribute wealth enough to ensure universal healthcare. It isn't that hard, all the cool countries are doing it, we aren't drowning in taxes, and the waiting lists are mostly only for elective surgery (non-life threatening stuff). I think that it could be possible to socialize basic nutrition and housing, as it has been done in times extreme hardship through charity. And if charities can do it, governments can do it too. Charities only take from the nice people (or people who want to look nice), taxes take from everyone (hopefully). And charities are often very inefficient, like food drives near Christmas that collect tonnes of canned cranberry sauce which is unusable and unfit for human consumption when if they were given cash, they could buy exactly what they need. And tax money is much more consistent and reliable than donations.   So while capitalism has some problematic tendencies, they can be moderated to some degree and it does have some strengths. Mainly that it is good at harnessing incentives to get things made and exchanged. If people don't have incentives to do things, they probably won't do them. And the marginal benefit of spending your time doing one thing over another is what is important, not the absolute value. If everyone is paid the same no matter what they are doing, there are no incentives to make them do the work that actually needs to be done. So while our current system can be greatly improved I don't see how it could economically function without some degree of capitalism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hey there, 'unskilled worker,' here.  I wanted to say something about one of the points brought up around 12:50 by the fake response lady in the comment section.  Some of the engineers I have met are honestly the biggest morons I have ever seen.  I've seen them almost decapitate themselves.  Often.  They tend to stand on the shoulders of big innovators that came before them, and try to retrofit ideas into very different problems.  I remember one guy messed up with a robotic clamp for picking up boxes; the clamps didn't come near tight enough.  The solution he came up with was to duct tape a piece of wood to it.  I'm really not kidding.  The machine he built cost maybe 250,000 dollars.  That's before wood and tape costs.  I lost one of my goddamn eyes because when I went to the doctor to see why my vision was getting weird, they said pink eye, gave me some drops, and pushed me out the door after taking my damn money.  It was actually really bad scarring that kept getting worse until the eye was useless.  Awesome.  Had to retake my driving test and I will never know how far shit is from me.  Can't afford a lawyer either (and I've stopped caring.  Don't know if good or bad).  There are a lot of people that are doing the bare minimum in college and going down the obvious routes to making the most money.

"I dont think the problem is capitalism itself. Capitalism has brought a lot of good with it. The poor today are infinitely better off than the poor a few hundred years ago. The problem is the coruption of capitalism, which I think is/has happened in America. The system works when everyone has a chance to make it and the losers dont fall into crushing poverty. But the rich has used their money to rig the game and secure their wealth, concentrating it around themselves and removing it from the social programs that can benefit the ones who doesnt make it. THAT is the real problem. I think the best system is a mix of capitalism and socialism. Where there is a basic living standard that is bearable, where you are not feeling crushed by poverty. You can eat decent food everyday, and you might not be able to afford the fancy car, but you can still afford a cheap car so you can get around.

"What I personally worry about is that in the end capitalism(even if it has socialist elements which doesn't harm it often so long as capital or money is still important to people) rewards people for innovation and discovery e.g. it rewarded apple for making smartphones as we know them today(bit too much but who am I to say) or how it rewards computer hardware companies for pushing the market forward with competition.... The idea is in a system where there is either no demand nor personal need to perform much better than your peers by starting a business innovation may not be halted but slowed.  The problem is we reached a point in science where normal one person is not enough to conduct research on complex topic normally you'd need many people from many different professions and if you don't stand eye to eye what is the banner almost everyone in a capitalist society is united by? Bingo money.  While money poses some great issues I really do think that there are solutions to these issues that don't involve abolishing the whole system in a communist revolution...

"Very thoughtful series! I do think there are some important pro-capitalism points you didn't address. I'd appreciate it if someone who opposes capitalism reads this and responds; I haven't seen these concerns adequately addressed IMO. The below is pretty rambling and way too long, but I'd really appreciate it if you read it anyway!  I have three major unaddressed objections to anti-capitalism: the empirical, the theoretical, and the moral. I will discuss them in order.  ____________________  Perhaps the strongest argument for the current system is this: it works better than anything else we've tried. The percentage of people living in extreme poverty has plummeted under global capitalism. Seriously. 250 years ago, about 85%-95% of the world was living in 'extreme poverty', as per the UN definiton. Today, it's 9%.  That's not to say the system is any good---it isn't---but please don't replace it with something worse. Namely, don't replace it with anything we've already tried.  Look, by any metric, this is the best period in human history, and it's getting better. The fact that it still sucks is a stark reminder of why we can't afford to go back to the way things were. Prior centuries make 2018 look like a goddamn paradise, so let's not fuck this up, okay? We need to FIX capitalism, not annihilate it.  On a similar note, partially-socialized capitalism is the best form of capitalism, according to the data. From minimum wage to social welfare, socialized capitalism has made the world a better place and addresses the failures of capitalism that it could never fix itself.  ____________  That's the empirical argument for partially-socialized capitalism: it sorta-kinda works, if you're nearsighted and squinting and blind in one eye. And as pathetic as that success is, it is, relatively speaking, a triumph. But why? Why does it work so 'well', relatively speaking? If we can understand that, we can understand what parts of capitalism ought to be defended and what parts ought to be torn down. In my view, it comes down to diversity and fault-tolerance.  Different people have different values and outlooks; if they are free to pursue what they want to pursue and express themselves how they see fit, it should result in people being successful. That's obvious. What might not be so obvious is the efficiency that markets experience when they leverage this diversity. When people are free to follow their passions, you end up with people creating the digital revolution in their garages. Since good ideas can and do come from anywhere, any attempt to enforce conformity and control innovation is bound to slow progress. Similarly, when acting independently and in aggregate, human society converges to a reasonable approximation of the aggregate of what people know and value. Prediction markets/futures markets are the best example---they show the wisdom of the crowds, as long as the members are sufficiently diverse and acting sufficiently independently. I can expand on futures markets if the discussion goes there.  Interrelated to this is the fact that capitalism, like democracy, has a degree of fault-tolerance not seen in any other economic system thus far. Here's what I mean: for any large-scale human societal structure, ask yourself:  *If everyone involved are greedy bastards who care only about themselves, what happens?*  Communism and other forms of totalitarianism fail this test instantly: if power is concentrated, then a selfish leader will fuck everyone else over for their own benefit. Anarchy suffers a similar fate. But democracy and capitalism fare much better. In a democracy, if you only care about your own personal power, you should faithfully execute the will of the people. Otherwise, you'll get voted out and lose your power. Similarly, in capitalism, if all you care about is money, you should make products that people want at prices people like; otherwise, people won't give you money. In particular, you need to keep making better and better things, or more and more food, and do so at cheaper and cheaper prices. Otherwise, a selfish competitor will surpass you.  Obviously, the above is an idealized version of how things are *supposed* to work. Things like monopolies, trusts, and false advertising can break down the system. That's why you need consumer protection laws: their purpose is to ensure that the markets are free, competitive, and based on informed consent. But, in my mind, there's no denying that capitalism fares better under the 'everybody sucks' thought experiment than, for example, communism. It does even better if democratically-enacted consumer-protection regulations are present.   Most of all, I don't want to see *a single point of failure* in a socio-economic-political system. That is, there shouldn't be a single point where, if it breaks, all is lost. When you concentrate power (e.g., by putting a single entity in full control of all markets), you get gulags.  ______  Finally, I want to argue for the morality of capitalistic ideas. As I've alluded to in the above discussion, I think that there are foundational human rights that anti-capitalism denies. If you're opposed to capitalism and have made it this far into my ramblings, do you fundamentally disagree with any of the following claims?  * Generally speaking, people have a right to own things. Private property is just, and its abolition would be oppressive.  * Generally speaking, if Person A owns Thing A, and Person B owns Thing B, but each like the other's thing more, they have a right to swap. People have different values, and if they are uncoerced and acting in full knowledge, they have a right to engage in trade. Markets are just, and their abolition would be oppressive.  * Markets have no reason to be restricted to pairs of people in the same place at the same time. Money, a social construct, allows dozens or thousands or millions of people to engage in trades across spatial and temporal borders. Insofar as it extends the right to exchange private property with consent and without coercion, the monetary system is just, and its abolition would be oppressive.  * With respect to these rights, all people are created equal, and have no more or less intrinsic claim to them than any other.  In my view, the above are the central moral arguments for capitalism. Communism, for example, explicitly denies each of them---except for the last, for it insists that everyone has no right whatsoever to them, and hence technically have an equal right to them. A system that respects and defends the above principles would be a form of capitalism. When capitalism fails to deliver the above, it is failing to accomplish its goal. But, I believe that these rights can be defended in a democratic society: I think capitalism can be fixed, piece by piece, at the ballot box, *without* sacrificing the things it's supposed to stand for.  __________  Thanks for reading, and I apologize again for the unreasonable length.

As far as what the revolution would consist of, I propose we boycott all corporations and stop buying things we don't need. And start buying all of our food from local farms. If enough people do this the corporations will be slowly starved and will do anything to get our business back. We'll have a list of demands which I would propose include a living wage for all employees. No unsafe working conditions.

"Oh yes, the Capital is the enemy... your very body, your first capital, is the problem. How convenient...  The very problem of your argumentation is that it entirely reposes on human happiness, the most abstract and flickerry thing ever. If happiness is eating and sheltering yourself, *some people say they have found happiness after forsaking all that*...........  The goal of human life is closer to Meaningful Struggle than Happiness, yeah that's Peterson-level of cliche, but it's true. You **WILL** die, thousand of years of happiness can be ruined in 5 minutes of inattention or malice. Your body feels pain and sadness a thousand times more than it feels pleasure (for obvious evolutionary reasons). If happiness is the goal, your entire existence is ill-designed.  If the economy role is to maximize our happiness, well it's already doomed. No, what it is yet one of the thousand tools we have invented to make life bearable enough that we can FIGHT in it, compete with an actual *chance* of winning.

"Gee, am I a little late to the party. (But not the Party.) No matter, here it goes.  I think there's an element of the capitalist world-view (if there's such a thing) and at the foundation of various philosophies that are either in favor of it as an expression of 1) acceptable status quo; 2) a desirable laissez faire state of affairs or 3) an acceptable compromise with bourgeoisie and ((( bankers))) until the Imperium can be reestablished that is like a see-through, yet completely impermeable film, making the Left's and the Right's arguments slide off of each other like water off a duck.  You, for example, assume as self-evident that feeding thousands of homeless is good and a $2000 pizza is obscene regardless of its gustatory achievements (and doubly so when none are evident). With this, I might agree. Kitty-kat in kombat boots may agree. Whole lot of other perfectly reasonable people even right-of-center may agree. Well then, why can't we all then form a united front against all things bad, rallying around all things good?  What The Golden One and The Crustacean Philosopher might not profess too openly, yet is at the very foundation of the Right is the notion which the Left seems to always sort of circle around, yet ultimately not meet head on, the notion that is is GOOD to let millions starve or be destitute, for implacable Destiny had made them weak and deserving of this faith. The Last Man is feeble, economically inept, and wears last year's Yeezzies. Woe to the Last Man. And of course it's good to have a $2000 pizza, ESPECIALLY if it tastes like crap, because this pizza is a flight of Man's indomitable Spirit, and, as true art, it should have no utility. Hooray for inequality and cruelty, the engines of all great achievements of humanity.  Now, the reason the Left has trouble addressing this head on, is not entirely clear to me. One reason, I think, might be that, whether you'd like to smash TERFs, punch Nazies or guillotine the Royals, you can't be too appalled by cruelty. And that's putting it mildly.   But the other reason might be that, historically, inequality and cruelty have been tried and seemed to have worked nearly unfailingly. As long as you don't go waaaaay overboard and cause a revolution (but even those are always started at the top and for the benefit of the top, and I don't mean this in your dirty gay way, I mean the faction of the ruling class that felt itself shortchanged).   And the Left has nothing, short of a few nearly comical and quick-to-fail examples of Utopias and Kibbutzes, to show for its positive example. And no real desire to debate the Right on principles and values, rather than stupid facts. Who cares if the immigrants are the cause of 1.5% or 35.8% of rapes? It's the Golden Ones who should be raping the immigrants. Else how are we to build das Ewige Reich?   I mean, truer words have never been spoken (at least never with an Austrian accent): 'The best in life is to crush your enemies, see them driven before you and hear lamentations of their women.' 12-year old boys of all races understand, Borban Beeberson understands, Camille Paglia understands, even Milo understands.

And overall making your country a nice enough place to live in, both in the present and the future. The problem with this becomes apparent when you actually start making changes in reality. An economic system is a very large and complicated entitiy, that no one person fully understands.

"So, I agree: capitalism has a LOT of problems. State regulations can make it more bearable (look at Western Europe), but discarding it is... Hard.  1. Even communism is capitalist now. China isn't the biggest growing economy because wealth is distributed equally. Their people produce, and if you don't produce, you die. 2. Money reflects want. So if someone makes outrageous amounts of money. It's not because he works hard. But his work is wanted really badly. Suppose a country taxes rich people a lot, it will push them away. This has happened in most communist regimes. 3. In the same way is communism really bad in making people do more boring jobs. If a task needs to be done. But not a lot of people want to do it, there will be a lot of want (money) for the people that do. So it will be done. If you want equal pay, no one is going to do the shitty job. 4. Money isn't all bad. The 'want' that it represents does correlate with happiness. Supermarkets, medicine, garbage disposal, those are all things we want and we're happy with. Want and happiness just isn't the same. And things like advertisements show the difference.  So an optimal system needs SOME capitalism. We don't want the most wanted people to leave. We want to reward people for doing difficult or boring things. It's about finding the line.   In America's case, I think taxing the rich a fair bit more, and providing more economical safety for the poor are fair things to do. Just know what you're balancing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I agree with every criticism directed towards capitalism in this video. The issue, for me, isn't that capitalism entails these systematic injustices.It seems like those advocating for marxism and overthrowing capitalism are primarily philosophers, not economists. I would like to see support for anti-capitalist policies represented in economic circles, but it seems like since Marx, the field of economics has moved on.

"Coming from a communist country I can assure you that as beautiful as Marxist theories may sound to you, the realities of how they are always applied on a country level is always problematic. Why? Because the issue at its core is not capitalism, it is inequality, which finds its roots in all systems. Just ask those that ruled any communist countries, while they launge in luxury, while corruption runs rampit and those that try to rebel or even just leave get killed at the borders. Communism is an excuse for dictators to give empty promises of equality to well intentioned people, only to cash in their money long term without the people even getting the shiny stuff. The average people continue being poor and miserable, they just get no social mobility, unlike in capitalist countries, where even if there is low social mobility, there is more than that found in communist countries. Not to mention that communism also goes hand in hand with country wide isolation and reduced access to the perks from the rest of the world, which for some places can make all the difference in providing medicines and food to the country (aka why Cuba starved for communism).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I read Ayn Rand books for fun back in High School (liked the weird, over the top plots and some of the self-help stuff but she uh...  She's crazy.  And I pulled more kind and charitable values out of it than anyone ever should from something spawned from her philosophy), I gave up and decided to be a business major in college, but I'm not a wunderkind when it comes to economic theory nor highly intellectual discourse on the subject of capitalism.  Yet, from everything I've heard from Rand, college, shit I've seen in my own life, and from discourse on the subject:  You're right.  Yet I genuinely believe Capitalism is the better option for preventing governmental control on personal freedoms while also pushing forward new tech that could help mankind.  But it currently doesn't, and isn't.    I had a whole massive thing written down of every single change I'd want, but the crux of it is adopting more Socialist policies by wresting private control away from public services and instituting a Hell of a lot more regulations and labor laws.  Let a private market exist, let that private market spur growth in luxuries and culture while publically funded works provide their services for free to the people that ultimately paid for it, the taxpayers.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I am an economics major, considering post graduate school. ( I only say this as a way to qualify my perspective not as a way of saying I have the answers).  But I do agree that capitalism is inequitable in its income distribition and its central parogative is around explaining how firms maximise profit and how consumer's maximise utility. I've been thinking about this for a while. Utility, philosophically and quantitatively speaking is an almost useless measure of happiness but it is the only means an economist has of understanding consumer satisfaction (at least in main stream economics).  It's really really difficult to implement philosophical rationals into the real world. For instance, public economics (welfare, social security) can only really be understood mathematically at a more advanced level than most undergraduate programs will aproach.   I know this is super rambly, but I guess my central theme is that this stuff is hard to figure out from the economics framework, and it's really easy for someone with a cursory understanding of the subject to walk away with the impression that libertarianism and small govt is the only only way an economy can function.   However, ultimately I think regardless of what form the economy takes, economics will be a large part of how the economy is understood.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"One thought: the issue with labor and income inequality is partly due to the supply and demand of/for skilled and unskilled labor. As an absurd example consider Lebron James. Not many people have his skills and his skills are in high demand. This lends itself to a high wage. Now, consider kindergarten teachers. While they indeed do hard and necessary work, many people could do (and would want to do) the job. This has the opposite effect and puts downward pressure on wages. So it is not really a question of how hard a job is to do but rather a question of how many people are willing and able to do the job compared to how needed (for lack of a better word) the job is.   As an example of this in real world, take a look at contrasting qualities of relatively high and low paying college majors (forbes has a good list). Generally, what you will find is that majors that end in higher starting salaries are more difficult and/or unattractive to students yet are in high demand by society (c.f., nursing, engineering, and statistics).   Just my two cents. Great videos.   -friendly neighborhood globalist   PS: I don't mean to pick on teachers.

"So, here's your problem.  When you say 'the economy should serve the people,' that's a little bit like saying 'the climate should serve the people.'  The economy isn't a thing that people make or shape - it's a natural, emergent system that springs fully formed from trade systems once they reach a certain level of size and complexity.  You can't control it to the extent that you're assuming.  For instance, you can't solve poverty.  Ever.  You can mitigate it to a certain extent, and you can narrow the gap, but, as some dirty hippy once said, the poor will always be with us.  So long as scarcity is a thing, poverty is going to be a thing.  You can't kill it.  Somebody will always have more while somebody else has less, and the nature of basic supply and demand guarantees that some amount of demand MUST be priced out of any market in order for goods and services to achieve their fair value (and when you try to stop that...well, just look at the seventies for what happens when price ceilings go into effect on critical necessities, and at the right fucking now for what happens when you put price floors in).  Now, what you CAN do is work outside the economy to balance the scales a little bit (a good idea) or you can try to leverage the market to achieve specific goals (neoliberalism getting a little full of itself).  In practice, the latter course tends to have unintended consequences and they're rarely positive, so the only solution you can trust is to directly intervene with an act that is essentially outside the economy.  Nothing is truly outside, of course, but it's basically economy adjacent.  You progressively tax the wealthy and redistribute that cash to fund the sorts of community improvements that would naturally arise from a more affluent population in disadvantaged areas, and you do more than a little bit of direct redistribution of actual cash money (though in practice this tends to evidence itself not as a check from the government, but a smaller bill).  America has been on a ride in the wrong direction of that particular balancing act for about thirty years now, but it's important to realize that the solution is not in any way Marxist because Marx's understanding of economics was...let's say limited.  The appropriate remedies to the situation are already largely in place - they're just not being driven hard enough.  The good news there is that this means we don't have to reinvent the wheel - just increase funding for social programs and finance that action through taxation primarily or exclusively directed toward the disproportionately wealthy.  The political obstacles to that are considerable (Americans, at a pretty fundamental level, believe that they are 'winners,' and only 'losers' need the gub'ment to give them things - overcoming that attitude is pretty much essential if you want to become more Sweden and less Galt's Gulch), but it's a hell of a lot easier than trying to pitch people on fundamental rearchitecture of a system that you can't really fundamentally rearchitect to begin with.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I personally think that the next big socioeconomic change is probably going to come through automation and AI. Because at some point in the not so distant future machines are going to be better at EVERYTHING compared to humans. So we're gonna need a completely different way of distributing wealth, because we don't need humans to work anymore.  But until then I think we should just try to make the best of the social-democracy-with-a-regulated-market-system (or whatever you call it) we have now, as it does seem to work extremely well compared to everything else we've tried. I mean we do live in the most prosperous times in history. And even the vast majority of 'poor' people have it very very well compared to almost everyone who has lived 100 years or more ago. At least in the western world. And all of the other countries are approaching the living standard we have now pretty rapidly.... so yeah revolution is definitely not on the agenda for me","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"If you want to understand, how capitalism actually undermines our consumer wishes, you just have to think about the internet. With other goods, you might argue, that limited resources can't just be handed out for free (you'd be wrong, but that's harder to explain, so I'll just let that stand). But with data, you can copy it as much as you'd like without it losing any of its properties that make it useful. Imagine all the wealth contained in the internet nowadays: movies, books, music, sources of knowledge, games etc. Theoretically, anyone with an internet connection has an incredible source of wealth at their fingertips. But under capitalism, that access needs to be limited, because you can't make a profit if everyone has access to everything.. So companies have come up with ways of restricting access, prohibiting sharing, thus undermining the very nature of the internet (its very essence being a way of sharing information) itself. In my lifetime I've seen the internet turn from a source of free, nice stuff to a ad-riddled, restrictive nightmare. And finally, I think YouTube itself is a fine example of an incredibly useful product, that millions use all the time, but also one, that everyone hates more and more, with each passing year, with each new problem (just think of the Adpocalypse or the Fair use controversy) because sharing content freely is simply incompatible with capitalism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"TBH I think Capitalism just needs to be diluted. Capitalism on its own is not inherently a bad system it's that it's much to easy for greedy pigs to twist the system to fit their own needs and suck up all of the wealth and therefore power, because that's the only reason the wealthy want the wealth they don't actually want to buy thousand dollar gold pizza cause gross they want the power that comes from being grossly rich. But if we mix in some socialism in and apply some checks and balances to the whole thing we might be able to get a decent society. For instance, have a guaranteed income for everyone who has a net worth of 1 million dollars or less that gives them enough money to live a nice life. Have all schooling and any associated costs for schooling, like pencils, paper, books, food be free to the citizens all the way from preschool to college. In places where it's practical like large cities have free and reliable public transportation. And basic free housing and utilities, including the internet since that's a necessity for modern life now. And tax any single persons wealth once it's reached over 100 million.  And to everyone saying that we need to incentivise entrepreneurism, no you don't. I guarantee that we will get more innovations once more people don't have to spend all of their time working just to live. Cause just look at the maker community and you'll see that 90% of the people who invent and build things do it for little to no profit because they are doing it for the joy of creating or the joy of giving. and the people who are doing it for profit are probably doing that because they wouldn't be able to eat otherwise.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The Lizard People are capital makes perfect sense. We give Corporate Entities rights and 'personhood', Thanks Citizens United, They are for political and 'legal' purposes 'People'.   But a corporation is simply a collection of Money and Resources (Capital) that is essentially making decisions and performing actions in the social and political landscape with its only goal being profit, and that goal is MANDATED by laws inherent in the investment structure. Corporations can get sued for failing to do their best to provide for the shareholders best interest, which in a large corporation of millions of shareholders, simply becomes a lowest common denominator goal of Profit.  Single minded, cold blooded, entities, composed entirely of just Capital, with a simple, hard headed single goal, and the resources and political power to achieve it.

"Having rich pizza is good.  You may not want it, but enough people who do buy it.  And for some people it's worth it.  Having diverse tastes and desires is good.  Diversity is good!  (Unless you only mean in terms of skin color, in which case, you are just racist thinking skin color is the most important thing that matters.) Enough people create things that YOU like.  And more are being created all the time.  Capitalism pushes for this.  So you with whatever unique taste you have is fine.  You can co exist with people who don't like the crazy food or things that you like.  The chance of you liking something that no one else likes goes down as the more capitalism is employed to help satiate everyone's needs.  More capitalism = more needs met for everyone.

"Just came across this. You're not my typical viewing and your...unique personality and proclivities aside, I thought the 2 parter was a good series. Here's the thing, your premise is flawed. I don't blame you, liberal arts does a number on how you approach problems. Feely arguments are valid so long as there is a little data to back you up. I understand where you're coming from, I do. Capitalism feels unfair. Thing is, economics-the abysmal science that it is-still has rational actors. We spend money on stupid things when we have disposable income. Or invest it in business when there is a place we can do things new or even just better. That's where most of us are employed, luxury items like cars, tech, entertainment, retail, scientific research, etc. We can't all be farmers and carpenters. We're rational enough to make the right decisions or we'll drive a market to a bubble and ultimately a market correction or crash. In numbers we make intelligent calls... eventually. Socialism doesn't do that because it's directed by a small number of individuals. No matter how well meaning these individuals are they have blind spots and won't invest in a diverse economy. This inevitably leads to a long term collapse. Venezuela is a best case scenario. Their collapse should, I really hope, be short term. There are enough resources to recover, assy least there used to be or socialism. Soviet communism or socialism in general is fundamentally inefficient because every possible economic niche isn't being filled. It's the same as a healthy biosphere, diversity breads durability. That usually means that when things go bad, and they will in any system, the leadership that controls production is left with limited options, usually double down on industries that are no longer sustainable or hide the failure/blame the capitalists. This leads to long term poverty and even though pretty much everyone is equal, they're all poor. During the 2008 crash how many starved in the US? No one who didn't want to. We'd stored a lot of wealth and had a safety net. I'm not going to argue against those-they're obviously helpful. Some public programs are good. Healthcare, might be viable maybe not. A lot of people will lose their jobs though. Take time to research more numerically based econ. Study the thermodynamics...that's what it is after all. It works, regardless of the system in place. The key is how diverse is the system and how efficient it is. Are cities being built in they middle of nowhere just to put people to work or are people moving to places where there is work? Are new and out of nowhere ideas getting into the market or has the mix of industries gone unchanged for the last 50 years?The whole 1% thing us more complicated than many would suppose. Most middle and upper middle class folks that are middle age to retirement will be in that category for a year or two. It's a generational gap more than anything. And the benefit of that stupid pizza is that it takes the wealthy peoples money and gets it back into the economy. Is it gaudy? Sure. I'd certainly feel uncomfortable eating it but if I could charge some nut $2k for a pizza and employ a few more people, or pay the ones I have better, will I. Probably. That's the brutal truth. Ultimately, that money isn't just going to charity to pay for food. It's going to employees who then themselves contribute to the economy. Are there gaps? Yeah, no system's perfect. But those hungry kids have food stamps so they probably aren't going hungry. And that stupid painting paid someone's mortgage. Happiness, levels off because you have disposalable income and the freedom to pursue your dreams out to just live. We can talk about ways to fill gaps but capitalism models natural economic behavior closely. We don't want to get rid of it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I disagree with your take on Peter Singer here. I do agree that effective altruism is flawed as a movement. It is immersed in - at best, tacitly, and often explicitly, as in Singer's case - doctrinaire Act Consequentialism. This is the first problem with the movement, given that Act Consequentialism is a bad moral theory (see, moral philosophy 1789-2018). Partly as a consequence of this association, it is infected termite-like with pretty hopeless and toxic liberals. The cumulative consequence of this (see what I'm doing, MacAskill?), is an excessive focus on individual activity and an unwarranted neglect of coordinated, wider systemic change (I can hear the Mills whirling in horror in their graves at what has become of their creed).   Nevertheless, the basic arguments of Singer in ''Famine, Affluence, and Morality' and Unger's 'Living High and Letting Die' remain true today. At least not without further argument and serious engagement, the upshot of their core arguments are not corrupted by the defects of the contemporary effective altruism movement: *relatively globally privileged people have an obligation to donate significant amounts of their non-essential income to high impact charities* ; this is the least strong construable conclusion, but the arguments are independent of abstract moral theory and, I would contend, political ideology. Living relatively modestly and giving to charity does not preclude political commitment and activity. I'm sure you're familiar with the arguments and their general cogency: I think they deserve more than the peremptory half-dismissal presented here. I hope you will engage with the arguments more seriously in the future - if for not for the really serious nature of the issue, then because I am sure your perspective will be interesting, reflective and amusingly conveyed.   I hope it is needless to say that this is intended as constructive feedback - I love your videos.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There's a lot left out between 'you only need $75,000 a year' and 'gentlemen scientists used to exist, so clearly impassioned work is its own reward.'  First, a lot of people DO enjoy working hard in order to be rewarded for it.  Working hard because you think of your wealth as a living video game score is what's sociopathic about the billionaire class: money doesn't matter to them in a material way any more than it did to gentlemen scientists in the 18th century.  Most of the people who do want to work hard and earn more than $75k a year think their work is worth more than the bare minimum because they DO have unusual skills or talents, or they realize the cost of living somewhere that isn't a boring rural shit hole is sometimes way more than $75k a year.  Arguing that some labor is rare and should be incentivized surely isn't arguing for the reptiles.  As for the gentlemen scientists, as much as I love Carl Sagan and his 'curiosity lurks in the heart of every child if you don't crush it' ethos, the fact remains that there were *very very very few* gentlemen scientists in history and a LOT of good scientists who demanded to be paid well for their work.  Jonas Salk is exceptional for NOT patenting his cure.  Unfettered capitalism has failed an enormous swath of the population, but it also HAS rewarded ingenuity and hard work in ways that DID improve billions of people's standard of living.  When people walk down the street screaming 'revolution', I don't think most of them have thought beyond eating the rich, like you pointed out in your first capitalism video.

"I'd like to take a moment to question the implicit idea here that spent money dissapears into some sort of aether. When someone spends $3,000,000 on a painting that cash didn't really directly translate into real labour and real goods dissapearing, it just put that potential to force labour and goods into a different direction. Money isn't spent it just moves between people, with the golden pizza, how many useful resources and useful labour was wasted on it? What proportion of it's wasted materials were expensive purely because they were rare? Really rich people handing their money to other people in return for shiny baubles and trinkets that are NOT the result of exploitation any more than normal materials beyond the fact they are rare doesn't really... do anything. Money doesn't represent real value or real goods or real services it represents power to appropriate those things in a particular direction.  I think a more meaningful measure of equality is the difference in available utility to people rather than money since at a certain point of wealth they are spending ridiculous sums of wealth on things with little to no utility above what everyone else is consuming.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I disagree that it's 'capitalism' so much as it is individuals making poor choices when they are given choices and freedoms. (To be clear, I still think they should have those freedoms to make those horrible choices, even if they use that ability poorly.)   The definition that many people on the left use for capitalism, 'the private ownership of the means of production.' The body is the ultimate means of all production, so there is a clear problem with that definition.   My critique of the current economic system is its lack of congruity which is what leads to its weakness and ultimately makes it easier to exploit by those who would seek power above all else.   My conception of capitalism from my study of economics is merely the explicit contractual agreement with your community to not initiate force against people who use their bodies to produce, protect, maintain, and exchange things in a fashion which is voluntary. Law in such a system deals with establishing who has attempted to attain something through the use of force and using force to return the goods. In sum, the goal is 'if you acquire something unjustly or that you haven't earned, you have to give it back.'   The problem is that we choose to support things we shouldn't because we are fucking stupid and we don't understand that consequences of our actions. But, would it be more in accordance with the goal of morality (seeking eudimonia) for us to allow people to make mistakes and poor choices or to force them to be unable to fail? Well... the value in life comes from the pursuit of the good and feeling like you are doing something beneficial with your existence. If you give people all the answers, more people might live longer and fewer people may suffer with challenges low on maslow's heigherarchy of needs, but no one will ever truly attain fulfillment or be able to feel accomplished. It is the level of guidance that we give people through regulations and laws that makes our current society feel so vacuous, not the fact that we are surrounded by what you conceive of as capitalism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"So, Ive done a calculation.   Trump's recent tax cuts which went almost exclusively to corporations and the super-rich were estimated at about 3 trillion.  That's enough to give the 'maximum happiness' amount of 90 k dollars to 33 billion people! Or you could feed the world and still let either the billionaires or the US government have more than two-thirds of the money.  The money is right there, available, and being squandered. The US was fine when these 3 trillion were still being collected, and the billionaires will be fine with like one less yacht.   You don't even need to drastically overhaul the system! It's almost mind-boggingly feasible, sums like these are *already* being moved around by authority.  Keep things as is but give everyone basic income. It worked just fine in Canada. No loss in productivity, but better health, more education, better school grades,less domestic abuse etc. - more buying power = more things being bought + real choice = more growth.   I don't believe that it's just greed- The 'scarcity' / 'contribute to the pack' mentality is ingrained because that's what we evolved for, but its not reality anymore.  A lot of work can be done by robots and AIs these days, and we need to adapt to that.    Heck, forget the US or the entirte world, if you distributed Germany's ca 600.000 million Euros in Tax Revenue evenly across its 80 million inhabitants,  you'd get 7500 million per person, in which the 80k of 'max happiness level basic income' would barely make a dent, especially considering that most of the tax revenue goes to welfare and retirement, which would no longer be necessary.

"4:02 The amount of labor you put into a commodity is a component of its exchange value. But it is not the only component. past a certain point you can't make people pay more for something by spending more on any of its inputs, including labor. The presence or absence of market-power, consumer preferences, and legal restrictions like price floors and ceilings also affect the price you should expect a commodity to earn. 8:00 Before you can make the claim of exploitation, you need a way to know the true value of labor, for only then can you know the difference between its true value, and its actual remuneration. 10:20 This actually depends on how you measure happiness.

"Please read Mao so that you can understand what was going on in the USSR and the PRC during and after his lifetime. Just reading a few of his documents, even skimming the little red book, it becomes incredibly obvious that he never abandoned the road laid down by Marx and Lenin. In fact, he continued right where they left off and gave us even sharper tools for our liberation. Mao wasn't a fascist or a hypocrite; for his whole life he led a people to liberate themselves more and more from capitalism. Capitalism has come back since his death, but that didn't bother Marx when he saw the Paris Commune fail, and it shouldn't bother us either; we already know what's possible.  There's a reason the 60s was turbulent across the whole globe, and it's in large part because of the leadership Mao and the people of China showed the world during the Cultural Revolution. That leadership is a large part of why the black panthers existed, why the troubles started, why May 68 in France happened, and why there have been Maoist people's wars in Peru, India, the Philippines, and Nepal. It shook the globe, and people everywhere took notice in big and small ways.  More than just understanding why capitalism is bad, we have to know how to end it and why its end is inevitable, and we have to grasp that truth not only with our minds but also with our hearts and souls so that we can fight for ourselves and everyone we love. Entire countries have done this before, and the entire world will do it one day soon. To anyone in the US who is interested, I suggest looking into the Red Guards collectives and the organizations they support, because they are inspiring and show that the work can and will be done here too, even if the movement is small right now.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Great video(s) as always, but I'm always frustrated with how critiques of capitalism refuse to steelman capitalism. I mean, high GDP is not the only thing capitalism has going for it. The rate of invention and innovation under capitalism is astronomical. The rate at which capitalism pulls people out of poverty globally is insane. The rate of medical advancements have to tip their hat to capitalism. Sure, there will be inventors and innovators regardless, but money and luxury can be motivators too, and that's fine; it's fine to like stuff. The thing markets have going for them is speed, and capitalistic speed is a force to reckon with. I agree with every critique you have, but i think we should focus on redistribution as a means of catalyzing more capitalism. In my head it looks something like a fairly decent UBI, no minimum wage, and rampant capitalism. But I'm shakey on the minimum wage part.

"I'm not sure we can dissociate glamour from a capitalistic construct, and if we could what alternatives would we point to that do not function as envy-producing, power-perpetuating models?  I am not saying that, for example, wearing glitter on one's body is inherently this or that. I'm only saying that we have to actively redefine it's social meaning, rather than throw all of the glitter we have at our disposal onto ourselves once we've overthrown capitalism. Such celebration is understandable, but is, in the end, capitalism's desperate final attempt to manifest. In other words, if the masses shift toward a gluttonous celebration by way of referencing those luxuries that were prior to this point unavailable to them, we're, in my view, perpetuating the mindless hedonism that capitalism instilled in us (or really perpetuated) in the first place.  If it isn't obvious, I'm not arguing for the deletion of fun and replacing it with pure reasonable responsibility or something like that. Instead I'm arguing for an active, intentional transition process of deconstructing the social value of many commodities, such as those you implicitly (or explicitly) celebrate in this video by assuming the masses can relate to the 'I like stuff' point of view far more than the Marxist jargon initially utilized.  Alcohol, for example, is utterly normalized. From a societal and economic lens, it's transcended its taboo image (maybe since the abolition of prohibition?) and is seen as simply a part of life. Your channel certainly does not challenge this notion (though I admit the argument could be made that you tend to associate consumption of alcohol with the idea that the world is a shitty place, thereby implying that such consumption is our collective desperate attempt to distract from the ills of capitalism).  However, alcohol remains one of the most dangerous commodities in this nation. The statistics are glaringly obvious to me, but if any reader feels they should be cited I'll come back to this thread.  The point is that we are conditioned to value alcohol the way we do at least in part by its market appeal (duh), but most of the alternative factors involve capitalism indirectly, such as the perspective implied- or at least the perspective I interpret- in your videos. Not only do they involve capitalism, they at least keep it as the status quo, and at worst perpetuate it.  On a case by case basis, shit happens and escapes are necessary/understandable (I use alcohol as such an escape myself), however, if in the minds of revolutionaries or 'socially enlightened' figures overthrowing capitalism simply translates to a hedonism no longer impeded by mandatory competition, wealth disparity, or professionalism being the metric for moral soundness,  then I need to seek out a different group.  In short, we definitely acknowledge many of the same problems of capitalism, but we seem to be differing on the degree of emphasis needing to be placed on collective intentionality for cultural innovation so that we're not mindlessly flopping around once we've achieved the next economic reality.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'll say this much about the wealth stratification & happiness threshold (and this is purely anecdotal, so take it with a grain of salt): I live next to a community of multi-millionaires, and they absolutely flip their shit when a property tax is issued or the marginal tax rate is bumped up, even if by a fraction of a percentage point. I straight-up asked a guy (after he had calmed down a bit from raging at the sky) why he was so mad - the tax wouldn't impact his well being, wouldn't impact his ability to leave inheritance for his family succession & wouldn't impact his ability to grow his business.   It impacted his net worth, is what he told me, and this positioned him at a social disadvantage to those who didn't live with such a tax. People over in Vancouver with much more lax taxes would treat him like the weak little bitch with a weak net worth.    There's this entirely new social dynamic at the upper echelons of wealth that we just don't even notice while we're hovering around or below the happiness threshold (which is why Donald Trump's 'real net worth', which most people couldn't give a fuck about, mattered so much to the wealthy commentators who kept bringing it up during the American election).

"I was studying to become an accountant until financial aid ran out. This is one of the things that got me riled up. Current economic theory, specifically Reaganomics or trickle-down economics/voodoo economics/supply-side economics, is that we should sacrifice the standard of living for the GDP. The only reason anyone cares about the GDP is that it is an indirect measure of the standard of living. So, the current economic theory is that humanity exists to serve the economy, and realizing that is how I became a socialist. I lay awake at night pissed as fuck because people think this is a good economic theory. Literally, the only way to support it is to not understand the conversation, that's how goddamn stupid a theory it is. And this is the thing that rules our political discourse, an idea disproven by definition alone, proven faulty by all of history, the idea that humans exist to serve a byproduct of their existence. The only thing that makes this more comical, is that the Republican party, obsessed with the economy as it is, has a worse track record than the Democratic party when it comes to supporting the economy. It's almost like the theory that depends on not understanding what words mean doesn't work","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"From a longer and broader look at history, I would say that much of human history boils down to a kind of class warfare waged by the haves vs the have nots, and occasionally the have nots towards the haves when things become unbearable and too oppressive.         Let's go deeper than political labels, terms, and concepts and get to the root of this.  I think that root and core has to do largely with psychopathy, which is a severe lack of felt empathy and conscience at it's core (the kind of, 'Let them eat brioche' kind of mentality, mind or 'heart' set).  And perhaps in the context of, vs the rest of us--i.e. the majority who have some empathy and conscience.         NO, I am not saying all the 'haves' are all psychopathic. Psychopaths make up a fairly small subset of the general population (depending on what source you cite, it ranges from 1 to 4%  Tbh, I doubt it can even be measured accurately within even a +/- of 2% range).           I'm more so saying that there seems to be a long term, repeating trend of psychopathic types eventually weaseling their way into positions of most power and wealth, and then negatively influencing and affecting the society and civilization they are found within, towards that of eventual breakdown and entropy through corruption, greed, inequality, misuse of power.           In today's society, this avenue of power is primarily through banks, corporations, and government.  I'm not even sure if I should mention government as a separate avenue since it's been so infiltrated by the former two that it's practically, though not completely, an extension of the former two.  Or in common parlance, it's largely become 'bought and sold'.        Who but psychopaths can wage wars for completely unjust and self serving reasons?  Who but psychopaths can develop, foster, and maintain systems that not only promote but reward individuals, groups, belief systems, and ways of living that create inequality?           Yet, to some extent, we, the majority of non psychopathic types, are complicit to some degree or another, so we cannot solely lay the blame on them alone.  We allow ourselves to be duped, bamboozled, and manipulated. They dangle the carrots of materialism (the belief system of happiness via stuff, status, and/or power) and we follow.  We've become an entirely too materialistic society (and increasingly cut off from nature), which is helping them to phase us and society into their image.  That breakdown/entropy point has begun for current civilization.       It's interesting to compare and contrast these larger, more organized civilizations (Babylon, Egypt, Persia, Greece, Rome, Huns, the 'West' + America in general, etc) with smaller and nature based societies (often referred to as 'primitive', indigenous, or the like).  These were aware of and had their names/labels for psychopaths as well, but rather than let them connive, con, and weasel their ways into positions of overmuch power and influence, they usually dealt with them swiftly and harshly once they started to cause problems for the tribe/community.  It was understood and realized that they wouldn't and likely couldn't change their ways of causing harm to others. They were either booted out, or killed.        Being nature and community based, and often having some kind of strong spiritual and/or nonphysically oriented core of ideals and/or beliefs, they could not be bamboozled and tempted so easily by such types.  Perhaps the smaller size and population also just made it easier in some ways, since everyone tended (tends for current ones) to know each other more fully and more intimately.  Plus, everyday survival and relying on one's community and neighbors was such an ongoing and vital part of life that you probably tended to look a little deeper at and into those around you.         Solution(s):  Become educated about real psychopathy research and not Hollywood and media versions which tend to be exaggerated, distorted, and often focus on the rare extremes even within same, such as serial killers and the like. Most psychopaths are too smart, self controlled, and self protective to become serial killers, or even occasional killers, except in the legal and government sanctioned forms like wars. Your average psychopath is your surface friendly politician, police officer, fireman, CEO,, t.v. media teleprompter reader, lawyer, or the like.        Start demanding that positions that inherently give power and authority which can really affect the lives of others, be subjected to a battery of tests that can help to weed out psychopathic types.  Whether talking police, congress, parliament, CEO's, to Presidents, Prime Ministers, etc. There is increasingly accurate and more objective testing being developed such as brain scans, pupil/emotional reaction to different stimuli, and other ways that are already being used in a research way.  As we are learning more, we can develop better testing.       Potential police candidates do go through some very basic testing, but it's along much more subjective, psychological questionnaire and interviewing type, which is not (obviously) adequate. Psychopathic types are often very good at conning those of us with empathy and conscience.  Sometimes they are even downright charismatic and 'likable' on the surface.        Start moving back more to nature and real community as a culture and society in different ways, and start becoming less materialistic and ego based.        Ultimately the change starts with us on an individual level.  The more who choose and align to real Love--(universal) and who become more and more healthy and positive within, the more it will spread, strengthen, and eventually become easier for the many.  It's a quiet, but potent revolution of consciousness, and this too has begun alongside the entrophic societal breakdown.          Though it might come off as 'fringe' and out there for this largely intellectual type crowd (in some ways, I'm much more a mystic at my core, having had a number of so called 'unusual', nonphysical oriented experiences), I would also add that we are getting various kinds of behind the scenes help, and likely will get some dramatic, obvious help in the near to nearish future.  Our unhealthy addictions will be broken for us, and all that psychopath's, and these increasingly psychopathic system's, power is based on (a combo of wealth accumulation and technology), will be washed away, so we can start afresh and unencumbered.    It's a lot easier and much more possible than many might think it is, since our current system is extremely fragile, or rather, based on an extremely fragile physically and technology based infrastructure.  All it would take to completely collapse the whole thing, for an example, is one large, earth directed Solar CME.  At this point, with the increasingly weakening magnetic field of Earth, it wouldn't even have to be a Carrington type level event (which has an average frequency of occurrence of about every 150 years or so, I believe I remember reading). Or see the following for a glimpse: URL      Also, we have wiser, more aware, and mature siblings out there that when the time is right (after the collapse), will begin to interact in a much more obvious and public way.  This will help to shift a lot of paradigms as well.        So while things currently and on the surface look rather grim and hopeless considering how much power, wealth, and influence these psychopathic types have accumulated and consolidated and the kind of future they are trying to (currently fairly successfully) nudge and manipulate us into (one of constant fear, complete materialism, and selfish, uncaring indifference and separatism), I'm not too worried about the future. The probability is that things will change drastically for the better, after a relatively brief period of much challenge shared by all.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You fail to grapple with any of the real challenges to capitalist critiques, almost all you produce are strawmen only said by those attacking capitalism. For instance no one actually defends the view that the ultrarich 'deserve' their billions while the poor toil away in run-down areas (in fact many would laugh at the conception of anyone 'deserving' any level of wealth given the desperate poverty which has gripped most of humanity throughout history). To quote Milton Friedman one of the greatest economists and statisticians of all time, 'Most economic fallacies derive from the tendency to assume that there is a fixed pie, that one party can gain only at the expense of another.' This fallacy is committed throughout in talking of the maldistribution the existing wealth produced by the capitalist system, it is precisely the capitalist system which allows for such accumulations that produces the observed level of wealth. You also fail to mention the value of the price system in allowing for the communication of the distributed knowledge of our preferences so that shortages and waste is minimized. This is not a serious critique of capitalism, but rather crude propaganda.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

For the end question of what to do, more could be said about the role of 'the self' in the functioning of capital. If you haven't already (yet to make my way through all your videos), could you consider how people act out their discontent (whether vague or specifically articulated) in strange, more private, more spontaneous or implicit ways as well as (or instead of) trying to plan and support very deliberate and public collective strategies?   The fascists, the communists, alt-this and that, established political groups... Guilty as I felt, I could never get into them. Sometimes the places you never expect to find subversive ideas like the churches, pubs, rap battles, farms, scooter gangs, playgrounds and whatever else is where you find the real surprising counter-capitalist authoritative voices. A pastor's going to tell a shop owner right then and there that a postcard commodifying a woman's arse is wrong but he or she's not gonna go up to randoms on the beach and say it, if he or she is also an ordinarily decent person who sees others as whole people and not just postcard arses. A rapper's gonna say, 'eh fuck you, i'm better than you, I don't need you' but catgirl I reckon, would complain smugly about not getting employed at a cafe because some sort of ism and phobia, and also about the fact it is not vegan, after she groveled, did up her bullshit CV and bragged to Mum and Dad that she finally got an interview and that her SSRI's have finally kicked in - poor catgirl, bless her. :( We just need to know people who are normal and tough and effectively, authoritatively *act* unconsciously anti-shit-stuff-about-capital.

It certainly wasn't a perfect society, but there's cases where nazi propaganda about the soviet union was never corrected and we still believe them to this day because it benefited our side of the cold war. From the october revolution to stalin's death, you can see the development up to WWII and the destruction after WWII and the rebuilding of their society all over again. The soviet people have had endless wars waged against them. We have grown to have a subtle racism about eastern europeans that we can't even examine their societies for policies that may have worked. Literacy after the fall of the monarchy went to 99%. Life was never luxurious, but afik you still got what you needed, which, for a society that had been destroyed from 2 world wars, has to mean something.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hey! First of all, your awesome! Thanks for the videos. On min 12:20 you said that the problem of inequality is that people working really hard in sweatshops are not making a lot of money. The problem with that is supply and demand, a concept that is key to capitalism and that you didn't address. Capitalism solves the incredibly complex problem of allocating an unimaginable amount of resources both material and in the form of labor in the most efficient way possible (still shitty, no doubt). Now, some jobs are really important but the supply is always low, such as engineering, so you need to pay more to incentivize people like me who don't like to digest a ton of boring a$$ math to go into the field while discouraging overcrowded fields such as unskilled labor. A solution would be free education and a better chance in high school for teens to sample possible future careers paths as well as giving them info on the demand and pay of different careers paths (instead of wasting their time). A decent minimum wage to increase demand (Ford pay his employees well enough to afford his cars) and a general system more like the European one also could be of help.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"20 year old college dude here: I used to be a staunch right-wing libertarian activist and pretty active in their circles... and then I watched your channel. Since early high school years, I've looked all over the internet and debated all kinds of people on political issues, but it only solidified and strengthened my confidence in the ideas of free-market capitalism. Part of why I turned to radical right-wing politics in the first place was due to my family's background. They grew up in the Soviet Union, so I'd been more than briefed on the corruption and atrocities of Stalinist-era 'communism.' I delved into literature  on classical liberalism, anarcho-capitalism, etc.. for years and mindlessly followed the ramblings of the capitalist intelligentsia. It wasn't until I stumbled on your channel, ContraPoints, that I'd heard some of the best critiques of neoliberalism and developments in radical right-wing culture in contemporary contexts.  Thanks to you, I've gradually found myself aligning more with the left and shifting mindsets on all sorts of topics.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

You can have capitalism with less inequality.

"There are still people who do philanthropic things in a capitalist system so the polio example to showcase how a world without capitalism would be more giving is somewhat flawed, especially when considering the system gives  people a reason to work and do the great work that they do. Although people are unfairly paid it constantly gets better because the system helps correct injustices because of buying power from the consumer. Don't like that Nike uses sweatshops, buy another brand. There will always be those who are unjustly paid though because people are imperfect so creating anything that is 'perfect' will always be imperfect to someone else. Doesn't mean that we shouldn't aim for something better but in the words of Churchill, 'Capitalism is the worst economic system except for all the others.' Until someone figures out a better one it's the best system so far. I would argue that as social creatures our lives are more fulfilling when we focus on others as well instead of materialism but the fact that capitalism creates an environment where people do not have to hunt all day for food or build their own homes and defend their land from other humans directly (for like 90% of people) allows us to focus on community, family, and friends more than we would have to otherwise. I think anyone though that believes capitalism is perfect is off their rocker but there are definitely huge benefits that would make a video amiss that addresses capitalism and doesn't discuss how much capitalism has forwarded civilization while at the same time exploiting people. I also believe that the goal of capitalism is not to maximize happiness but to put people in positions where their skills are best suited (like in administrative positions) to try and bring happiness from a work environment to government level. The framework that has allowed inventions like the washing machine, automobiles, and smart phones would be difficult to have invented if the legal and societal structure weren't there to provide resources and incentive ($) to make these things that have helped us get to where we are now (less time wasted on washing clothes, trying to walk someplace, or talk to friends/family so we have more time to talk about why capitalism sucks :) ).

"Theoretically a company that has a lower cost of capital should be able to out-compete one that does not. Capital itself is a cost under capitalism, that's what dividends are, so my suggestion would be to use crowdfunding campaigns to stage hostile takeovers of certain types of public companies by employees and customers. Utilities and cable companies would probably be good targets. I'm not sure the tax code would currently support this but it could be made to support it: the hostile takeover targets could then be controlled by not-for-profit organizations. With favorable taxes and no need to pay dividends, these companies would be able to pay more and attract the best workers as well as charge less for their services and be more conscious of long term decision making. It also has the benefit of being able to co-exist with capitalism as it currently exists.  By the way, I am a rich straight white cis-male capitalist and Marxism is a messianic religion.

"You're wrong. Very, very wrong. You're working on the assumption that wealth is distributed, as though it was a naturally occurring resource that everyone is entitled to an equal share of. It isnt: it's earned. The fact that it is 'distributed unequally' has nothing to do with capitalism. The cause of the unequal distribution is the Pareto principle. Any accumulation of wealth is aportion of the sum of an emergent systemic process of decision making engaged in by us all. What accumulates will inevitably accumulate more in few people, in the same way that only a few stars and black holes in our galaxy contain almost all the mass; they bigger they got, the more mass they attract. The more mass they attract, the bigger they got. They aren't greedy reptilian capitalists. They're stars.  The reason this pisses you off is another erroneous assumption: that in the absence of malign influence, economic outcomes would be evenly distributed. But nothing in the world has ever been evenly distributed.   I like the example of tornado's. Being an apparently ubiquitous weather phenomenon, it strikes people as bizarre when they learn that the vast majority of tornado's occur in one place: the Midwestern United States. But why? Are there weather racists that onlynlet the poor tornado's occur in one place, and do we need to Rosa Parks the mother-fucker and redistribute those tornado's over the planet so that they can finally experience justice and suck up cows into the upper atmosphere wherever they like? Or is it simply that other locations around the globe lack the prerequisites for tornado's to occur.   The tornado's have rights, but...you know. That's life I guess.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You are asking for a government to solve personal problems because.......disparity is bad..... In those 3rd world countries we note they live under authoritarian governments that 'redistribute' wealth just like you want but they are more corrupt than individuals and the disparity is even greater in those 3rd world countries u mention. Sure, capitalism makes use of (or takes advantage of, however you want to word it) communist countries with bad labor ethics, but that is not a flaw of capitalism... that is just smart business. If China was the same sort of capitalism as America, then companies wouldn't be able to do that, and therefore the fault is in China's communism, not in America's capitalism. You literally criticize Jordan Peterson for using lobsters to talk about how hierarchies and disparity exists in any system and shouldnt be blamed on capitalism alone saying its a strawman and that no one claims that and yet here you are blaming capitalism for disparity in the hierarchy of society. You ask for redistribution of wealth because of the corruption and disparity of capitalism which produces the sins of golden pizzas and student loan debts.....yet you want to trust government for that redistribution instead of voluntary exchange, but when government fails and goes corrupt that disparity you accuse capitalism of is made even worse and you get countries like venezeula, or the USSR, or Maoist China, or Cambodia, or Hitlers nationalist socialist (Nazi) germany, where the government became corrupt and killed millions for what it thought was 'best for the people'. In the end you can either trust the individual to make their own voluntary decisions for their well being and you get some corruption here and there like golden pizza but also get the freedom to live off of youtube channels that criticize the very system that pays them. Or you can go your way and you get 'wealth redistribution' where the government decides 'whats good for you' and 'how much you need' but if it goes corrupt with centralization of power required for that (and remember government is made of corruptable human beings like you and I).....well everybody dies.....I think i prefer some student loan debt and golden pizzas as a worse case scenario...instead of the alternative of mass genocide....just saying","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"My partner and I have arguments about this all of the time. My headspace is squarely within the wealth-sharing, egalitarian side of economic theory, whereas his is more nebulously capitalist, with a strong lean towards 'taming, controlling, and regulating the beast'.  He also has a background in finance and business, so his insights hold some value to me as expertise, even if at times it feels more like he drinks the 'kool-aid' than actually believes in its theoretical foundation.  He doesn't think our more utopian vision of the future will be possible until all of our necessities like food, water, shelter, electricity, internet, medical care, etc. are inexpensive or free, universal, and made through fully automated means. Until that point, he believes that careers that earn people less money will always be the foundation of a capitalist economy, precisely because those job paths are inexpensive and multitudinous. An example: most Americans like to eat cheeseburgers and live in houses. Thus, McDonalds jobs and construction labor jobs are easy to come by, but are relatively unprofitable. Whereas, famous, well-received artists are fewer and farther between, so the market values their economic output more. In my opinion, this is of course unsustainable and cruel, but it's the 'nature of the beast' to capitalists.  In his view, the future we all want is one where the necessities of our lives are free, fully automated, and fully regulated, while the Capitalist economy that would still exist afterwards would only be sustained by the value we decide to place into it, via our non-essential skills in more luxurious, consumptive markets like culinary arts, travel, hospitality, sports, design, art, music, film, TV, etc.  In my view, this is just as utopian as my view of an ideal future, and it too heavily relies on a benevolence we would have to entrust the ruling classes with.

"The things you like existed long before capitalism, but the damn thing is just so good at making the things that you like easily available. You might want to cite some number from google about how many poor people that don't got no shit are living in a capitalist society. However, you might want to ignore the fact that those people, (particularly Americans), live in a society that takes their welfare very seriously and implement laws for minimum wages, healthcare availability, and safety nets. Saying that we elected Trump is not evidence enough that capitalism is a bad idea, only that certain tweaks can and should be made to the election process. Saying capitalism doesn't work ignores the very bedrock that those inevitable changes will be built on. I want you people to fight to make changes. I see absolutely no harm in discussing the possibility of making the good thing we have even better. We need it, but what I don't want is a fiery, emotional response to income equality by completely throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Capitalism has effectively made that expensive champagne easily available and sustainable to be afforded by someone who literally makes cute videos for cash.

Is it that I have been so conditioned by my society that I can't see it any other way? I have learned to interpret pretty much every system (monarchy, even communism) as capitalist.  Perhaps it's using 'capitalism' as a short hand for 'power dynamics under scarcity,' but I do feel like acknowledging that sameness across pretty much all of the previous systems often helps to break down some of the ideological divisions I've found with others in my life.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"The problem with your argument, especially the whole Das Kapital trend your pulling for is specialization.  Adam Smith and David Ricardo figured that out and Marx does does too but then says it's awful.  Your forgetting that anyone can be good at a lot of things at the same time but to be great at a few things makes more sense because individual preferences change and adapt.  It brings massive efficiencies and lower costs overall to the general consumers.  This sort of quasi jack of all trades for all makes everything sluggish.  Ironically, Marx and Engles Manifesto, the first few chapters glorify the good things capitalism has brought to societies. This creative destruction that got rid of the old and brought in the new. There ideas was a sort of liberation for people but he forgets or didn't understand at the time about distributive knowledge.  Where as these Marxist societies tend to centralize it all to a few and try to make changes top down.    In fact if I were to make a scientific comparison to capitalism, it's evolution.  Evolution is a bottom up testing to see what works in any adaptive environment.  Capitalism is the same thing.  People steadily test out many things and other people decide if it makes sense.   I get it, there are a few Uber rich people. But think of all the value those people have contributed to society.  I think what people should really look for is rent seeking first before we really start to regulate how any firm or person operates.  Take Amazon, it has brought tremendous value to consumers however their HQ2 is a huge scam and any city that gives tax preferences is a sucker.  Instead of trying to throw out the system maybe tackle those types of rent seeking.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"After spending the best part of the last three days watching your videos, I finally found a direct point you are making that I disagree with.  Happiness shouldn't be overlooked, but it really is not the most important thing, or at least not something I would approve of as a main goal of a succesfull political system. Things like freedom, self-actualization and altruism are on occassion conflicting with individual and collective happiness. It hurts when you don't have a daddy to tell you what to do, when you accept that what you want to be is ultimately unachievable (and even if it weren't, becoming it would not guarantee happiness, in fact, achieving a goal is also connected to a sense of loss of purpose), and sometimes the legitimate demands of others feel like oppression.  Besides, if all we needed was to be happy, why not just take drugs that give us that? Even assuming we could have enough for everybody...  I tried too hard to be conventionally intelligible so I think I earned this: In the words of Slovenian Santa 'my god, hasn't she read Freud?'  Cheers and keep up the good work  P.s. I hope I didn't play down the importance of happiness or how draining it must be to be unhappy all the time because I am generally not an unhappy person and as of now I don't truly understand said experience  P.s. 2: I know it's not in my best interest to tell you this but I am Greek so there you go I sort of fit into your stereotype","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It's definitely not a magic bullet through. Sewer systems and other natural monopolies don't work well under free market conditions, and overall it's prone to corruption and injustice. We haven't found anything better that works though.   I appreciate that you admit you don't have a simple answer that will fix everything and absent a revolution, we should probably focus on making the current system the best we can.

"(This is just me thinking out loud...) I feel like the solution to this serious issue is a yet to be imagined post-capitalism rather than having a revolution and shifting to the increasingly aging alternative frameworks we have. Maybe I'm just one of those people that thinks that major societal ills are just so big and complex that they take generations to solve.  I mean, what does Marx have to say that is still uniquely Marx if in 100 years we effectively eliminate from the globe most human means of production, standardized labor, and agriculture through automation and tech? Looking back on history, it seems like time and the boring advancement of civilization is a greater liberator of people than the impatient tinkerers have been no matter what their politics consisted of.  ....and there are some really out of the box economic systems being hatched these days that may eventually prove to eclipse all the systems we are debating now.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think the most irritating aspect of this 2-part video is that you don't really give any alternatives to capitalism. You consistantly call for the end of it, but propose no system to replace it. You make some very good points on certain aspects of capitalism and how to replace them, which I really respect. But unfortunately you don't seem to provide a solution for an overall new system. Many people in the comments seem to have decided for themselves. I'm especially terrified of the people vying for a communist revolution. Communism, even the kind that has only been realised on paper, is extremely flawed and will only serve to oppress us and regress society even more. I'm more partial to a mild type of Social Democracy. It isn't a ridiculous extreme like communism is, and the aspects that don't work can be changed until it benefits everyone, without going as far as to creating a new communist regime.

"9:16 Capitalism leads to innovations in technology, which in turn lead to less labor needed to do the same work and the currency acquiring a higher value, and those changes make life cheaper and easier, giving people more time to be human.  12:12 Sweatshops don't exist in the US; although, I wouldn't be surprised if there are a few that employ undocumented immigrants. Workers in manufacturing in the US tend to get paid pretty well for their work. Work in factories tends to be very difficult and dangerous. Difficult and dangerous work almost always pays well, and definitely quite a bit more than minimum wage. Those people could find jobs as fast-food workers and janitors, but they choose not to. I would think that factory workers in the US get paid somewhere in the range of $15-$30 per hour depending on where they work. Factories in the US aren't like the sweatshops in many Asian countries. Also, if a worker gets injured on the job, the company he works for has to pay the medical bills for his injuries as well as pay him for all the days he can't work, and the company can't fire him. The workers will sometimes sue the company, and the company will have to invest in improving the safety of the workplace to avoid more lawsuits. The United States has regulated capitalism and big corporation can't treat their workers like slaves like they had done throughout the Gilded Age.  Also, thanks to capitalism, when companies don't want to spend as much money on workers, they invest in engineers to develop more efficient tools and machines for manufacturing. With better technology, we have safer working conditions and less people needed in manufacturing jobs. Therefore, less people being exploited and dying from work related injuries, and a higher demand for STEM related jobs that require higher education. This has also resulted in those companies paying there workers higher wages for their hard and dangerous work. Nobody would work in such a place if it paid minimum wage or anything near it, it would be very illogical.  My dad works in remodeling. It doesn't require any higher education, but the work really makes you exhausted and you always sweat like a dog. Sometimes you work in a very cold or hot environment. Sometimes you work in a dusty environment, or an environment filled with toxic materials in the air. There's also the risk of getting some pretty nasty injuries if you're not careful enough, like getting a nail in your foot or losing some fingers. Working in remodeling can have pretty negative effects on your health; therefore, people who work in remodeling don't tend to live as long. However, in exchange for your hard work, you get paid between $20 and $30 per hour. No fast-food worker or janitor gets paid that much, and those jobs require the same education as jobs in remodeling.  Most wealthy people who would spend $2000 on a pizza would not get a pizza like the one shown in that Buzzfeed video. They would spend that kind of money to buy a pizza from one of the best pizza chefs in the world, because they have a passion for good food. Only some crazy rich people buy food with gold in it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"You're thinking about this the wrong way. Bartering for things of value is human nature. If you try to squelch this because some people are too good at it, you'll won't be able to. Look at the drug war, is it working? No. People are just selling drugs illegally. Why? Because other people strongly want to buy drugs. If I have something of value, or am able to provide a service of value, people will give me other stuff of value for it. You can call this 'capitalism' if you want, but it's not really a system, it's just the way humans are. The best we can do is try to prevent people from getting an unfair advantage. But you can't stop people from trying to acquire things of value. And you can't change the reality that some people will be better at it and will acquire more things.   Trying to implement systems that go against fundamental human nature never works, because people literally can't help defying your system. Sharia isn't going to stop adultery or 'fornication', for example. The drug war isn't stopping drug sales. Banning abortion won't stop 'back alley abortions'. And communism will not, and never has stopped inequality. All you'd be doing is agreeing to willingly give all the wealth to a small group of people who would then use it to mercilessly prevent anyone else from acquiring wealth (and as I said, they certainly will try). And you're trusting these people to 'redistribute' the wealth fairly. Which they won't. This expectation also contradicts human nature. How many examples of this do you need before it becomes clear to you? What are they teaching in philosophy majors these days. Jesus Christ.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Personally I believe that a decent way of combating capitalism is to fight it within it's largest sphere of power...... The market place itself.  The idea is to form cooperatives that would create and sell products like any normal business but the main difference is that these cooperatives would be owned by the workers with elections to decide who shall lead the cooperative. Once the cooperative has become a rather successful business than you atempt to find another cooperative and form a sort of cooperative partnership and the goal is to keep expanding until there is a sort of union of cooperatives in multiple industries under a sort of similar system (or at least under multiple systems that aren't a threat to each other) and if this union of coops where to be formed than that union would be tasked to make as much profit as possible whilst keeping a worker based republic or any other worker based democratic system. Once this union has generated a sizeable amount of income than it can attempt to start new cooperatives as sort of cooperative satalites to be used as expiraments until a successful coop creation method can be formed so the union can regularly expand no longer needing to be be dependent on hoping that other cooperatives would be willing to join such a union. Once  the union is able to fully create its own profit generating cooperatives than it can start worrying about competition with large capitalist businesses and we would just battle it out in the market place and hope the best system wins out.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The human condition causes all economic systems to be at risk of corruption. Changing from one system to another also isnt the only solution, fixing the problems with the existing one is an option. The root solution to most of the shortcomings of capitalism come from forming strong moral compasses in people, and teaching people at an early age the true pursuit of happiness, being self satisfaction who who we are, rather than what we have. This solution would also contribute to repairing many other shortcomings in society, such as depression, failure to launch, inequality as a result of bias, just to name a few. The problem with this solution is there is almost no effective way to roll out this state of mind en masse. It needs to be taught in a one-on-one way, almost like a mentor/protege relationship. This form of relationship already exists in parenthood (to some degree), but isnt treated that way. Millennials suffered at the hands of a system where they were told they could be anything they wanted and have every opportunity made available to them, without being told the other side of that lesson; getting what you want requires effort. Now we have the next generation being raised by iPads and other windows into the internet and youtube.

"I think that most problems you are describing are caused by few main things: 1.) Patents. They stifle competitive market and allow swollen corporations to grow while being grossly ineffective and treating their workforce as crap. 2.) Regulations that require proactive compliance. I believe that you should be able to just do stuff you love and make as much or as little money on it as you like, as long as you are not hurting anyone. Regulations that require proactive compliance force you to use scummy business practices until you can afford to comply with them. 3.) Corporations as a legal business entity itself is a problem. You should be able to do any voluntary deals you like, and earn billions through signing such contracts and employing lots of people, but you should also be legally responsible for your actions. CEOs would rarely do any fraudulent things if they could be personally punished for the consequences.  4.) This is the biggest one - remove a legal responsibility of a corporation to maximize profits! Right now, if you don't do every single money grabbing thing you can think of, you are actually breaking the law. That definitely has to go, and it would solve so many problems.  Removing those problems is very easy, all it takes is to scrap a bunch of laws. Direct responsibility and fair competition with no ability to hide behind a corporation or a patent would solve a lot of that.   And I definitely have to disagree that capitalism must be removed. I am open to less intrusive corrections, like basic universal income, especially when automated labor makes labor of large amount of population unnecessary, but I am strongly against deciding how much someone needs or deserves and redistributing it. It some robs people of ownership of their work and others of responsibility for their destiny, often - a reason to live. You partially or fully enslave some people to partially or fully infantilize others. The reason is total misery, and it is no wonder that any economical model other than capitalism requires tyranny and totalitarian terror to exist. Countries like Soviet Union could only last because of prolific black markets, otherwise people there would have kept starving to death by millions well after the Holodomor.  My basic idea is reducing state to bare minimum, removing both things that harm and benefit the rich people, maximizing freedom and opportunity in favor of security.

"Hi Contrapoints! I really enjoy a lot of your videos, and both this and Part 1 were good at both analysis and entertainment. However, I'm concerned by the use of the lizard metaphor for capitalists/capital itself. While you explicitly clarified you don't mean it to refer to Jewish people, and in your Part 1 you referenced David Icke's conspiracy theory, I think that the 'lizard overlords' is such an antisemitic conspiracy theory/dogwhistle thanks to Icke that trying to use it in a different way just doesn't make much sense and detracts from your overall point. While Icke's use of antisemitism through Protocols of Elders of Zion involves his claims about actual bona fide lizard people, SO many antisemites use the lizard people/lizard overlord metaphor as a dogwhistle even though they don't actually believe in the lizard part. Rather, it becomes a way to blast antisemitic rhetoric about Jewish control of the world without actually saying the word 'Jewish' and sparking outrage, but still signaling their true intent. Someone who uses 'lizards' in the exact way you do to describe capitalism in another context, maybe a tweet or Facebook post or another Youtube video, would use it to mean truly vile antisemitic propaganda. That's something that no leftist should want to associate with! While you mentioned Icke in terms of his selling a lot of books through conspiracy theory, I think it's just a terrible metaphor for trying to sensationalize a philosophical and ideological argument. There are so many better ways to make it interesting, other words to call capitalists or etc, than using this conspiracy theory that has basically become inseparable from antisemitic connotations in modern Internet culture. While it's good you clarify your intention with who you're referring to as lizards, it was still deeply unsettling to watch these two videos and see that rhetoric again and again that has origins in arguments that are so contrary to what you were trying to say. This detracts from your overall message, and probably alienates a large number of Jewish anticapitalists in your audience. As leftists, we need to stand up to antisemitism and show support for Jewish people, and I think that no matter how good your intentions are in this video, using the lizard analogy has such an antisemitic history and ugly connotations to this day that even with your disclaimer, it just can't be fully separated from that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The fact that the $2000 dollar pizza cannot be said to be more healthy nor better for you than a (let's say) $15 dollar pizza should tell you a lot about this whole thing. For all its flaws modern capitalist society has produced a lot of abundance in the principal necessities of life. I guess the criticism here is that men should be spending their efforts and time elsewhere, rather than in the production and consumption of golden pizzas, and perhaps that would be the case if we had different form of government.    URL  - I think the wealth/happiness graph is very interesting, but you have failed to establish a causal relationship between the two. It can be that wealth lead to happiness but could it also be that happiness lead to (moderate) wealth?

We can both be rich if we work just as hard, have the same knowledge, and start from the same conditions (roughly).    URL - I don't see how this study justifies a 'equal outcomes' concept of fairness. The monkey revolted because he was not given the same reward for exactly the same action. In order for you to claim that this has any relevance for your argument, you must first make the case that the poor person and the rich person are performing the same action (and this is ignoring that we are extrapolating one study on monkeys in a specific setting to the wide range of human interactions - a process which could at best be described as pseudo-scientific at best).

"I think comparing capitalism to communism is apples to oranges. Communism is a founded system, whereas capitalism is an emerging system. I create a knife. You need a knife. i give you the knife I made. You promise me an amount of food for that, food that I couldn't get because I was busy making a knife. Of course, I want a bit more food. You know. For resource security. So that I have something to eat while I am between knives. Profit. Since you won't be making your own knife, you agree to this 'favour' I ask of you, and give me a bit of extra food. Simply put, that is the essence of capitalism: 1-on-1 trade with a bit extra on the side.  The problem with 'capitalism' as I see it is not capitalistic at all. Not really. The problem is that an aristocracy has accrued power, and is using that power to gain privileges for themselves, while limiting the amount of power other individuals have access to. And this... This situation will occur in any society. It doesn't matter if you get your soldiers because of the law you made, or because you can pay them. The end result is that you wield more power than others, and wield enough power to secure that power. It's not a uniquely capitalist problem.  As for 'will there be games?' Tetris... Isn't a good example. Because it has zero story. Yes, it is a great game, but gaming today is not just about scorepoints. Story and character perspectives are incredibly important to many people's gaming experience.  Communist countries don't produce a nice diversity of stories. They just don't, because diversity means a challenge to an authority that remains in power in large part because of its insistence on conformity. in our capitalist West, we can make The Last of Us. We can make Dragon Age. We can make the Witcher. We can make Metroid, we can make Skyrim, we can make all sorts of games with all sorts of stories, all sorts of characters, all sorts of perspectives. As long as you can find a market for it, you can make it and sell it, and it really doesn't matter who does or does not approve. The same is not true in a society where you are banned from the market because your perspective does not jive with that of the Authority.  Soviet Russia created especially great music. Bombastic music. Music that celebrated Soviet Russia. Music... Without a message or perspective other than the Greatness of Russia.

"There's a couple of major flaws with your critique. First of all capitalism isn't a system that creates wealth inequality. The problem of wealth inequality is deeper than capitalism and broadly speaking comes down to differences is capability of individuals leading to a differences in value output. These are differences that are rooted in biology, peoples IQ and trait contentiousness plus a lot of other factors, like luck, timing, etc. There has been vast differences in wealth all throughout human history and certainly long before there were any kind of cohesive socioeconomic structures like capitalism. What you are however ignoring is that capitalism has vastly increased the absolute wealth of basically everyone. When you reward high IQ people who have the ability to generate vast amounts of value for the planet to enjoy, they're motivated to keep doing it, they find ways to better achieve that.  Secondly, while wealth inequality has grown, the total (absolute) wealth has also grown massively, while the people at the bottom of capitalistic hierarchies have significantly less wealth than those at the top, they also have significantly more wealth than those people who are equal under non-free hierarchies, ones like communism where the markets are centrally run. And the evidence for that is plastered throughout history, if you look at say the USA post indepedence, they were one of the freest countries from state power, thats why they fought the UK for their Independence because of the tyranny of the government. And look at their staggering increase in wealth and quality of life from then to now. Then compare the same time period in say the USSR where millions of people starved to death.  Sadly this has the classic look and feel of people who don't really care about the poor. If you care about the poor you'd want the best for them and the poor are richest under capitalist (free) economies, than what they'd be under basically any other non-free market system. It seems like all you care about is lowering the wealth of others so that everyone has the same amount of stuff, a race to the bottom. That it's OK to make the poor people poorer because at least then they're on equal terms with the rich then.  Making the argument about happiness is all fine and well, the data on that is clear. But it's up to individuals to decide what they'd rather do, either be happy by focusing less on wealth once they hit diminishing returns. On average the happiness of women has declined steadily since WW2 whereas men's is about the same. The freedom to work and focus on careers has not made them happy, the highest levels of happiness reported by women is when they're mothers and raising children in a stable and provided for family. Yet presumably you would not accept the happiness argument in this context?  Finally the best arguments for capitalism is that free trade absent any coercion/force/violence is the most moral system that exists, it's also one of the most efficient. If A and B want to trade privately goods/services they legitimately own then that occurs with consent of both people. Then if person C comes along and redistributes that wealth somewhere else they have to do it through force, which is immoral. When you have free trade absent force you develop high trust societies and the higher the trust the less the financial overhead and the richer we all become.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It is possible that real communism could work as it has never actually been done. Everyone seems to ignore that whole bit about who we need to enter into a fully socialist state first. This may explain why every communism needed an overbearing state presence, and as we know overbearing state presences tend to grow corrupt and more overbearing.   Having said that I do not think communism is the best end either. I do believe the greed/ status model is the strongest motivator there is (at least in aggregate). It creates quite the paradox because Marx leaves this component out. He is right that working at a shit job to acquire baubles is a hot mess which sucks the soul from you before letting you die feeling like an idiot for having done it your whole life. But it also why we have great medicine, a chance to escape the planet we are destroying, a means to feed literally everyone on the planet (if we cared to) and so on.   An ideal system I think would distribute wealth better but also keep the greed/ status model alive. Not simply to each according to his need but rather to each according to his contribution and none beneath their need. Let the ambitious strive and thrive, but ensure all have what they need. I know the rich would hate this as it means less wealth but in the long run being more wealthy than your neighbor is the only real goal anyway they just don't realize that because to admit it seems so petty. The difference between having 1 billion and 10 billion is entirely about who has the bigger dick...ehem I mean fleet of private jets which they can brag about.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I am so pleased that I found this channel today. I have watched several of your vids today and I have to say it has been a long time coming for me to find someone who has a philosophy so similar to my own on several issues which when I attempt to discuss them always catch ire from either side so deeply entrenched in dogma they can no longer consider another perspective.   Anyway I just wanted to honor your work here and say I hope you continue indefinitely. I am sure at times I will not always agree with you, but if it comes from you I will have to give any point I think is wrong more consideration as you clearly give much more thought to issues than the fall into a tribe camps we see today.   P.S. also props for the way for your owning being Trans in the way you're doing it. I am not part of the LGBTQ community. In fact worse I am a straight white male in America AKA the absolute worst. To amplify that I also grew up in the 80's where only Boy George was allowed to be Trans and not hated and people were openly homophobic. I mention the above to point out it is not only the youth who is accepting of Tran's people but some of us older farts too. And I think the way to do it is not to hide or to pander but to do and just own it and be yourself which you are doing. I am sure you get much praise from the LGBT community but I thought it important that you see support from outside the community as well.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"11:50 'and honestly, I don't really understand how the economy works'  And this is the core problem with your work here... You don't actually know what you're talking about but you're still talking about it like the fool you are. While this is a great example of the Dunning-Kruger effect, what you're doing is irresponsible and you should feel ashamed.  Have you considered that an inefficient allocation of resources literally results in unnecessary death and suffering? As you don't understand how an economy works, you've taken a lot of characteristics of an economy for granted, such as what is driving all the economic activity that generates wealth and improves living conditions across the board, and you don't seem to understand that by messing with the free market, you can only decrease the efficiency of the economy and therefore create needless death and suffering. What you are advocating for, whether you realize it or not, will result in needless death and suffering, which is ironically, what you're trying to avoid. The free market simply can't be tweaked and configured to improve things, as you seem to believe is possible. You either take the free market as it is, or you mess with it and make things worse. There is no third option.  Have you considered that income inequality gets worse when state power increases, even if you're increasing state power specifically to reduce inequality? Basically what will happen if you attempt to re-distribute the wealth of the rich, is that the rich and powerful will use their resources to acquire state power (if they haven't already), which will ensure their stuff isn't taken and re-distributed. By expanding state power, you're literally giving the people whose wealth you think you can re-distribute the power to prevent this from ever happening. Simply take a look at the world right now - corporations are being subsidized with tax money, they receive all kinds of tax breaks, bailouts, etc... Do you not understand what is happening here? They control your precious government and they are using it to prevent their wealth from being re-distributed.   Have you considered that the state is a tool being used by the rich and powerful to maintain their positions in society, and not a tool that the weak and the poor have the resources to wield? Just think about it logically - do you expect people who were resourceful enough to amass a fortune to sit idly by and let their fortune be taken? Or is it more likely that they will employ their resources to seize control of the tool you're attempting to use to take their stuff, thereby making your objective impossible? This really isn't that complicated, and we've seen this play out, time and time again. The state doesn't serve the weak and the poor, it serves the rich and the powerful because only the rich and powerful have the resources required to seize control and wield the power of the state.  It's really sad how people seem to believe the government is the answer to all their problems, when in actual fact, it's the tool which is being used by the rich and powerful to create and maintain them. At the same time, they reject the freedom that what will bring them salvation, by putting them on equal footing with the rich and powerful. Instead, they would rather expand the power of their oppressors while deluding themselves into thinking that they are going to take from a group of people that is smarter and generally more resourceful than them.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

What is the secular basis of Judaism? Practical need, self-interest. What is the worldly religion of the Jew? Huckstering. What is his worldly God? Money.' -- Karl Marx, On the Jewish Question  'The attitude of the bourgeois to the institutions of his regime is like that of the Jew to the law; he evades them whenever it is possible to do so in each individual case, but he wants everyone else to observe them.' -- Karl Marx, The German Ideology  To make its firm stance against fascism more credible, the Left also needs to take on its own antisemitism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Income inequality exists for multiple reasons. 1.  People don't work the same number of hours. 2.  People that work the same number of hours, may not work at the same time of day (such as serving foor at 2AM vs serving food at 12PM), which in the service industry (like, say Taco Bell cook) means that no one is there to utilize your labor as effectively to pay you for your food. 3.  People don't work in the same locations, which means the subjective desires of the place you work may not be the same as the place that others work. 4.  People do not work at the same productive capacity in the same number of hours, e.g, if I work as a programmer, I might not work at the same capacity as someone that has worked as a programmer for several years (I would need to look for reference more often than a pro) OR I might goof off and watch youtube videos while programming. 5.  Certain jobs are in greater demand in modern society, I will make more money building computers than I will building rolodexes. 6.  Sweatshop workers work hard, but what they are doing isn't valued by society.  If I don't need something made in a sweatshop (no demand) then I will not pay for it.  This puts the productivity of a sweatshop worker at $0 if every person were like me, which would put them out of business.  However, not everyone is like me and some people might want whatever a sweatshop worker is selling, it then comes to how much of the customer's labor they are willing to spend in exchange for the labor of a sweatshop worker.  Let's say they are making shoes.  How can a sweatshop worker fight against automation?  By lowering the value of their labor to compete against machines.  Machines require fewer resources to be productive than people in many cases, which means I will either pick the underpaid sweatshop worker's shoes or the automatically manufactured ones.  Automation drives down labor value. 7.  You have to ask yourself why people work at sweatshops.  What are the trade-offs?  Perhaps the government in the area collapsed for budget reasons and heavy regulatory costs made businesses impossible to be run at profit or equilibrium.  Income inequality is more a difference in productivity.  Do not confuse productivity for merit or hard work, your productivity is the subjective value people give to your labor. An example of this is gold, if I have a home and find a gold vein in my backyard, and it takes me 2 hours to collect 2 kgs of that gold to sell, then my labor value is whatever people are willing to pay for that 2kgs of gold.  The going price for gold is about $44,000 per kg.  Therefore, my productivity (excluding the time it took to sell it) is $44,000 per hour.  If no one wanted to purchase that gold, my productivity would have been $0 and so would my labor value.  Remember, a non-profit business is always more efficient than a for-profit one.  You only gain profit when people are willing to pay you more than the cost of maintaining the manufacturing process.  Maintenance: labor, machines, power, negligence, etc.  Profit: business owner keeps what is left over after labor is paid for, machines are maintained, electricity is paid for and damages from other sources are all paid off.

"Here's how we know Marx was full of shit: nothing's value is based on how much time and effort went into making it or the value of the individual parts of a product. What determines value is whatever people are willing to pay for it. I don't care if your pussy hat took you 5 hours to make and is laced with gold thread. If people don't buy it from you for $1000, it's not worth $1000. It's interesting that you shame people for buying a pizza with truffles, gold, and caviar on it and the restaurant that dares to sell such a thing, but Marxists appear completely blind to the fact that those ingredients were bought from the working class. Fishermen harvested and sold the caviar to the restaurant. Farmers harvested and sold those truffles to the restaurant. Miners harvested and sold that gold to the restaurant. Are these people also abusing the common man because how dare they not donate the products of their labor to starving kids in Africa? No, and even in a socialist society they wouldn't do that either. In fact, in a socialist society African children still wouldn't have food and neither would the farmers, fisherman, and miners.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

There are other T-shirts with equivalent labor-time dedicated to it's production, and yet, lower exchange value. Another example would be the sweatshop workers you brought up in your own video. Consider the lack of correlation between the labor-time and the exchange value of their labor (i.e., their low salary).

"Here's the thing, although $2000  pizzas are absurd Capitalism doesn't make many of them because people cant afford them but it does make heaps of 2$ McDonald's  burgers even if they do taste like cardboard.  A million dollar painting is obscene compared to feeding the poor its true, but it also means there are many average paintings worth $200  that give striving artists a living.  The problem with Capitalism is that if it is unregulated and continues long enough eventually all the money ends up down one end. An individual having a billion dollars in itself isn't the problem , the problem is he cant spend it all no matter how much food he eats or  clothes and cars he buys , he is forced to invest it . When too many people have this problem we have a tidal wave of money washing around the planet trying to find a place to live with the highest return.  This is so much it destroys local economies and causes housing and stock market bubbles , pushing prices up far beyond what ordinary people can pay and far beyond the underlying worth of the asset. This in turn causes market crashes and forces ordinary people to spend half their life working to pay for what should really cost them much less. The only was to solve this is to tax the rich heavily.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's very convenient that a political movement funded by top bankers and major industrialists blames capital itself for the injustice of the system and world instead of the group of individuals who actually pushed for and benefit from that system (yes, the very same people who fund/funded Marxism and Marx). Marxisms fatal flaw is its reductionist worldview which never truly identifies the problem and hence offers no working solutions. This point in particular really showcases how it was created to be another tool of the elite which is quite evident by the fact that wall street capitalists among others funded both the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany into existence.  I agree with the problem but to end unnecessary suffering on earth we have to start by lowering our comfort and resource consumption to a level in harmony with nature. Once we can do that we can share our excess wealth with those who need it. I'm sure you could tot hat right now Contra. We cant just wait for it to fall in our lap. It upsets me that Marxism is so commonly dis-empowering to the individual. Even more so we must be the change we want to see in the world. I highly suggest you check out John St Julien on youtube. He's a man who went from being a materialistic drug addict to supporting and caring for over 1000 children in Tanzania through God and compassionate people sharing. We can all do it.

"So, like, capitalism is a process to allocate labor, at least in theory, when labor is scarce, right?  Put value on jobs, incentivize activity, pay out the dosh, which can be used in discretionary spending, right? Or is that just economics in general?  If that's *all* capitalism is, and it says nothing about the inherent rights of those who own the means of production, and nothing about the ability to generate 'value' out of thin air, now that labor is inbelievably cheap... Is it that capitalism is flawed, or that it is no longer relevant, due to advancing technology?  Labor isn't scarce anymore. We're generating jobs just to employ people to keep the money moving.  We purposefully retain a certain level of unemployment because it destroys bargaining power of labor.  That means, this isn't the situation where capitalism is effective.  We need a new system whereby rewards are not given for labor produced, but as a means of maintaining society in a world where our labor is superfluous.    Labor is a tool, and it shouldn't be a means to survive.  It certainly isn't for the top whales, who literally generate revenue by *having money*.  You pay an investment firm to throw your money behind the right people, and you get richer just because you had the money to be rich in the first place.  Good work, well done, we're all so proud of you.  I don't know if we are following a particular process, but this is the outline of a plan.  1. Develop a new system. Figure out a system and all its intricacies that actually creates a society where abundance is shared by all, where necessary labor is performed, where helpful labor is rewarded, where people's needs are met before luxury is distributed.  I know of several proposals, but I don't know if we've yet got a cohesive plan to bulldoze the entrenched systems with.  2. Spread the idea. Once the system is ironclad, even if it moves at a glacial pace, the next goal is to propagandize it. That doesn't mean the propaganda can't have ethics to it, and, ideally, it should be open to adapting new improvements as long as they meet the same tenets laid out above, but in essentially a war for people's minds, in order to be effective, it will require some emotional and irrational propaganda.  This allows for it to develop into a movement, and as a movement, a collective bargaining tool and voting bloc.  This becomes the platform under which politicians can win, if that route is possible.  3a. Support political agents. This is really constrained by just how far the system is willing to allow a change in ideals.  It hasn't been, though this new wave of progressivism *might* be a sign that the ground is fertile for some big changes?  We can hope?  There's not that much cost in this option, so it's worthwhile no matter what happens out of it.  3b. Bring it down. This is the Tabby land.  Smash.  Not really my area of expertise, but really, when given no other options, what is one to do but build guillotines?  I'm not really versed in modern revolutionary theory or tactics, and this does potentially involve conflict with the state, which means it's going to take a LOT of really crafty strategy to even be possible.  4. Ensure the new system endures. Whether by political change or by force, the system upheaval is going to create a weaker state of being. This isn't a capture the flag that ends when the base is taken. The system will have opponents, whether it is the previous beneficiaries of labor who have been deposed, or people sympathetic to them, or those who believed themselves to be deposed despite being liberated, or those who truly believe in 'the American Dream' ideology and its cognitive dissonance.  What does this look like?  This is where I tap out, because I have no idea how to walk this line without encroaching on fascist territory, and I'm not comfortable doing that.  That's actually the biggest problem I have with any communist doctrine I've been handed before; they all suggest using force and coercion to maintain a system, and once you get that far, I'm out.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

(at least, not openly)  If there were more tests available that didn't require subjective views -- or at least tests that could prove they believed what they stated to believe, I would feel more comfortable about these situations and not feel like it's a matter of coercion or dishonesty.  Part of the reason I have this hang-up is because the person I'm referring to is extremely volatile emotionally, which makes me feel like maybe they are using it as a wedge to attack as opposed to a belief they actually have.

"My current (novice, say-it-like-I'm-five) understanding is as follows: The free market incentivises production of stuff, which then leads to more stuff being available for everyone (and since that means more supply, there's less fighting over who gets it). But since the more stuff a person has, the easier it is for them to get more stuff, you get inequality.  Capitalism means most people are better off (Yaay!), but some people are way more betterer off (Booo!). That why I think we shouldn't get rid of capitalism, but we should keep a big social safety net (so that everyone benefits from the more stuff going around), and make the ladders up to getting more stuff easy to climb.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Capitalism sucks but everything else this far attempted sucks harder. Which, as you point out, isn't to say that we can't eventually do better, but the onus is on the critics to suggest something that hasn't been tried before.   I think capitalism and it's forerunners have been so long-lived and flexible because they reflect a lot of what is probably genetically innate in us, at least over the past 10,000 years of our evolution. Nobody knows the nature/nurture split, but suffice to say it seems like we like to fight each other on every end of the earth we occur,  and we like to create hierarchies on every end of the earth where we occur. Capitalism does a good job of preventing only the strongest people from living the good life. It provides multiple avenues for various skill sets and dispositions to derive a live-able existence by exchanging what they have for what they lack.   An under class has virtually always existed in every form of economic or social organization known, so this probably reflects a behavioral tendency in our species towards binary and hierarchy. We always find a way to have a bad so that we can distinguish the good. Someone always ends up suffering unfairly or arbitrarily. I agree with you totally in seeking to reduce that as much as possible. So far it seems to me that capitalism with built in protections for those who get wrecked by it is the best option conceivable. Capitalism ain't something I'm wedded to. As you say, should the economy work for us or should we work for the economy? I say capitalism is the best way to make the economy work for us at this time.

"The middle-later part of the video made me think a lot about tech workers, especially programmers and such. Tech work, like software engineering, is a form of labor that creates a ton of value, and often don't require being in charge of anyone to do so - it's not that much different of a mode of production from being a mechanic, where you just know stuff and make or fix it.  Tech workers get paid way more than most other jobs, but ironically, tech workers care a TON about open source stuff. A big job complaint is not being allowed to contribute to giving away their services for free for other people to use. Ideas about giving away all sorts of stuff for free both as in gratis and as in libre, have come from people who make more money than the general population, and from people who produce extremely valuable things.  'Why would anyone become an innovator or a researcher if they would make a good living as a janitor?' I remember seeing that there's a significant number of tech workers who would take a pay cut if they were allowed to spend more time contributing to open source projects.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Just want to give some counter arguments. Particularly in the definition of inefficiencies associated with distributing wealth. This is an assumption that labor theory of value holds where prices were also seen as absurd. Governments throughout history have held prices constant to be met by massive reduction in production, because simply put: prices signal scarcity. The pizza in this example is priced so high because for one, gold has many industrial uses and is hard to come by. 2, the ink in the dough comes from a rare animal, that for one shouldn't be killed but hey, some people are willing to pay (and with that comes ethics). At the very least, most people are priced out of these expensive endeavors of luxury - dare I say, rightfully so. It's obscene. Nonetheless, capitalisms openess and price signaling,  yields the best outcome we know of given the context of history. Our jobs as agents in the system is to reduce profit margins and reduce costs for goods, overall. I also think looking at labor economies as a zero sum game is rather disingenuous to developing nations, as they too benefit from cutting costs.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The funny thing to me is that gold flake pizzas (and/or diamonds) actually help the redistribution of the wealth you so champion. The reason they cost 2000 dollars is because there is enough tacky rich people out there who are careless enough with their money to buy something stupid like that. Thus, wealth leaves people who clearly can't handle it to luxury item merchants, and then back into the system of economic relationships, say hello to the invisible hand.  The crux of your argument about happiness is built on this a priori assumption that the purpose of economics is to make people happy, which to me sounds like wishful thinking at best. Economics is about distribution of limited resources to those who need them the most. The 1% don't hoard wealth, they actively use it in their economic activity. Of course, this leads to a self-sustain focused system if this process gets out of control.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Part of the problem with the way we tend to view insane luxuries like gold-flake pizza is that we focus on the price tag and not the direction the money is flowing. Some idiot who buys a pizza for $1000 doesn't have $1000 and a pizza, they have '-' $1000 and a pizza. The money they paid is distributed among the members of the industry who created the pizza, many of whom are much, much poorer than the idiots who can temporarily afford to buy them. With this in mind it could actually be argued that worthless luxuries actually do a great job getting money out of the hands of people who have too much money. The real issue is that a number of people with little money to spare are duped in this same way, which is where Socrates, Diogenes and many later transcendentalists assert it is necessary to question the real value of the materials we acquire from the basis that most things aren't worth the energy required to maintain them. Even if they are shiny.  I'd also like to point out that Capitalism doesn't value hard work in the sense of manual labour, and doing so would be totally absurd as a model for investing wealth. Typically in economics the idea is to pay the 'least' for manual labour, and on the part off industrialists is this model of paying the least that has driven businesses to increase the use of mechanization in place of manual labour. It is likely that any attempt to increase the amount paid to labourers will also increase the rate at which industrialists pursue mechanization - which I'm all for, but it won't actually solve the initial problem of poor labourers getting enough money to get by. Capitalism rewards smart work, not hard work. To most people suffering is not a valuable commodity. Reducing suffering is.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Poor people can't afford the most economically efficient versions of things (due to higher cost), so they're forced to buy inferior products, which do not last.  In the long run, they spend more money than they would have, had they been able to afford the most cost effective (but more expensive) items.

"Capitalism's great strength is that it is very nimble.  Imagine that there are ten different kinds of cars. There are pickup trucks, jeeps, sedans, coupes, and so on, and maybe alternate versions of each of these. How many of each should be produced each year? How should that vary from year to year? Where should they all be shipped? These are quite difficult questions to answer for a small group of people working together, a car planning committee, who have to make guesses like how much hauling a family in a particular area has to do, and which families need larger and more expensive to make vehicles, and which only need smaller coupes.   What makes it much easier is the introduction of personal choice to this equation, where each person or family asks for a particular car, but again, people being people, everyone is likely to want one of the more expensive vehicles to make. So, we sweeten the deal - take a coupe instead of a hummer, and we'll give you more of other things at another time. By far the easiest and most direct way to measure this is with money. Flawed or unpopular cars will lose sales to cars that are a better value to people over time, and those car companies can buy out the factories the old ones were made in easily enough. It responds dynamically to people, and gives them a sense of agency in their lives.   So, you've probably considered by now, why not give everyone the exact same amount of money, and have all corporations be state-owned, but still compete with one another this way? Suppose that we had a really great engineer named Sam. Now, she's not some 'great woman' who will revolutionize everything, she's just, you know, really great, probably one of the top 5 employees at the company she works for. Sam might have a passion for designing big, powerful cars, and in an equal pay society, she might choose to do that. It might be in society's best interest, though, that Sam works on a new airliner, something to help bring cheap air travel to the emerging markets in India, China, and South Africa. Knowing that Sam switching over for the 6 month project might save humanity, say, $200 million over the life of the plane, a number should be offered to her up to that figure that would get her attention on the project, because it would help the most people be the most happy. That, in and of itself, creates huge inequality, but it does so by raising one person very far, not lowering anyone else.  It's also worth noting that the investor class is an artifact of this system, not it's engine. The big piles of money that are thrown around by their stockbrokers  do serve a valuable purpose in refining new technologies, but they don't. If most of the profit went to the government instead of the investor, it wouldn't really change how the stockbroker evaluates companies and makes trades, or any part of the useful functions of the stock market. Other than a fear of capital flight, there's no real reason not to tax the investor class extremely highly.  The real issue, as I see it, is the conflation of capitalism with austerity in the public mindset. There's nothing about this process that requires the poor to suffer. The government could very easily send a monthly welfare check to everyone alive, and also let them work to earn more, and people would still opt to drive coupes, and Sam would still build our airplane. If anything, it'd be much more likely, since there would be a lot more people for whom air travel is affordable, but not easily, so the potential profit from such a plane would be much higher, and it would create much more happiness. Arguably, high taxes do generate some efficiency losses, because if Sam is taxed 80% and would have only switched to planes if it would have earned her more than $50 million after taxes, and that does cost society money, but it's fair to balance that loss against the gains in stability, happiness, and consumer power. This type of 'Social Capitalism' is still capitalism, but it's a better capitalism, one we can feel proud of.  If you're fortunate enough to live in a Western nation that isn't the United States, you likely have a major party you can vote for that would define itself as a social capitalist party. In the United States, there are politicians within the Democratic party who want to see the party move in that direction. If this is an issue you're passionate enough about to protest, your goals should be to attend every primary election you can to try to reform the Democratic party towards this end, and to try to talk about the advantages we'd share under a system like that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It sounds like your argument here hinges, to some extent,  on wealth being interchangeable with income. I could write (and have written) a thousand-word tract on this point, but that's irritating for everyone to read.  The main thing is, income and wealth aren't really the same thing. Wealth is income retained and/or put into appreciating assets. If the problem is a disparity in wealth, that's easily fixed with a bit of financial education on how to budget, save your money, and not get swindled by fees and interest rates, along with other basic financial literacy info.  If the problem is income inequality, then accounting standards have to change. Accountants are the ones determining what to pay people based on the value they provide. This is a point that seems to be missed a lot in this conversation. If necessary jobs can't earn a living wage, then either the dollar needs to deflate or be replaced, or accounting standards need to change.  Boiling the capitalist structure down to 'stuff is good' seems a bit misguided, as succeeding within the structure of capitalism is more about avoiding the stuff that's being advertised to you and instead buying the place that sells the stuff and getting a cut of the profits that the stuff earned. That and not spending your money over a long period of time. That's what I've heard from the rich people, at any rate.  I haven't been especially convinced that the problem of happiness in relation to money is caused by the inherent structure of capitalism so much as it is caused by 70% of the population being financially illiterate and not saving money until their mid-30s.

Basically, you seem to subscribe to the same utilitarian worldview that I do; that economic systems exist to promote happiness.  However, where you miss the ball is in your 'moral maths'; you fail to take into account the happiness of future generations.  It is a well known fact that overall, socialist systems (I'm not talking Denmark, I mean actual socialism) have less strong economic growth than capitalist ones.  Even if, in the short term, the more equitable distribution of wealth results in greater utility, in the long run the growth rate is what is most important.  If we implemented socialism right now, we might delay important innovations such as (for example) curing diseases, improving computing power and AI, and making farming more efficient.  So, in the long run, socialist systems lead to a decrease in living standards relative to capitalist ones, thereby decreasing utility.  This is, of course, predicated on the idea that you have an obligation to future generations, but I think it's fairly obvious that we have at least some duty to them.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Constructive feedback: Firstly, overall, good video. Thought about things from a new angle, was entertained. You're awesome, thank you for doing what you do.  I saw that you got some twitter replies saying that the introduction to the video felt slow and/or unnecessary. Reading that after having first watched the video, I agreed that the beginning felt a little slow, and thought you'd said 'I'm a dumb-dumb who likes shiny things' a few more times than was necessary. Now that I'm re-watching, I can't identify anything that could have been cut, because I think everything in the first half does add usefully to the video.  I did feel some confusion over whether you were playing yourself or a character. At the beginning I thought I was seeing a character, but then you went back to your normal voice and the video continued and I concluded you had to be playing yourself. I think I prefer it when there is a clear distinction between characters. 'I'm a dumb-dumb who likes shiny things' also added to the confusion. Clearly you like shiny things, and I would not dispute that. However I do NOT think that you are a dumb-dumb at all. I understand that you're probably using that as a deflection technique but I felt the need to say that I object to you calling yourself a dumb-dumb. Of course you don't have all the answers. Nobody does, and I respect you more for admitting it.   I would have found it helpful if you'd added a horizontal line at $75,000 on the graph at 10:32, so that we could easily see what was above and below the happiness threshold.  It might have been better to use a graph which showed the income distribution at a particular time (with household income on the X axis and frequency on the Y axis, to give a bell curve or whatever distribution US income has). That kind of graph would have the drawback that people would argue you had picked an anomalous year, but on the other hand some people don't have the maths knowledge to easily understand what a difference between mean and median implies. Showing trends over time didn't really relate to your point, and people might draw conclusions about things getting worse that aren't necessarily applicable because that graph doesn't seem to account for inflation and I doubt we have happiness/income data from 1980. A graph showing how far the upper tail of the income distribution extends beyond $75,000 would have helped to illustrate the point you made at 10:57.  When you mentioned video games you could have made a point about how annoying microtransations are.  Finally, I did rather enjoy being called a filthy Q, so thanks for that ;)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Marx believed that man would 'evolve' into a socialist, yet you still like shiny things. You like shiny things because you reject higher knowledge beyond the empirical. If all that can be known must be seen and measured, then you have created the axis on which value is determined. Secularism is capitalism. Marx tried to interject a secular framework for morality which could be solved by economics. This is a fool's errand. The reality of the world is that shiny things have been bartered for a very long time, and will continue to do so if the predominant worldview is one of empirical values in which no higher knowledge can be obtained. His distaste for Christianity was to some degree a form of jealousy, that within that framework was a way to manipulate the value of goods out of the market system by inverting the perceived value of having profane wealth, vanity, and worldliness. Marx could never achieve this by mathematical means, he could never justify *not wanting a gold Lamborghini* beyond an appeal to empathy toward an undefined poor person who could have benefited. But to what is the poor person owed money? What empirical value is there for empathy? You only live for a few decades, why bother? Keep in mind, this is the worldview that the United States wants to export to the middle east. They will help those meek savages by shoving them into the total market economy of Jeff Bezos and A.I. algorithms, so that they too can complain about how they like shiny things but never have enough money, and no means of actually changing the system within its framework. This is of course called 'exporting democracy.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I feel like, begrudgingly, that I must defend life in Socialist Russia and Maoist China. You'd probably be fine living in either, except for circumstances that weren't economic at all. Our associations of Stalin's time should always be considered in the context of a Nazi invasion that killed 40 million Russians, for example. You wouldn't want to live in 1941 USSR, nobody would, because it was facing a Nazi extermination campaign. Instead, you should compare these countries in peaceful times, although those can be hard to come by (Thanks, Capitalism!). Life in the USSR vs life in the US in the 1960s, for example, could be nearly identical, if you were part of a nuclear family. Similar luxury goods, movie theaters and tv and radio and novels (and no, they were not obligated to be propaganda, they were obligated to NOT be Capitalist propaganda). You wake up, you eat breakfast, you go to work, come home, consume some media or hang out with friends, and then go to bed. The big differences would instead be the far greater access of non-nuclear family living situations. Apartment buildings with communal kitchens and group meals were common, for example.  Mothers had no financial coercion to stay with a shitty baby daddy, so single mothers were far more common than in the US.  I understand this instinct to say 'I'm not absurdist left, I'm reasonable left!' but the arguments/dismissals used to express that are too often useless or even actively counterproductive. Seeing life in Communist countries as being miserable and not worth living is a big part of the ole Capitalist propaganda playbook.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Great video Contra! But let me push back on the thesis of this video a bit: that these are inherently flaws to capitalism.  First, let me just say that I'm not talking about really existing capitalism in the US. That shit's trash. I'm merely talking about any system where the means of production are mostly privately owned, there's wage labor, and a profit motive. Let's also add this in: because governments exist, all wealth is accessible. In other words, the government can tax whatever it wants however much it wants (theoretically, of course). And as you stated, capitalism produces the most wealth. So, assuming a good government, that means capitalism makes the most wealth possible for redistribution. Obviously, I'll now bring up Nordic countries: the happiest, most equal, and most democratic countries in the world. They are not communist by any means: rather, they tax at a very high rate, and redistribute wealth through strong social welfare programs.  This seems like the best system to me, producing the most wealth for as many people as possible. Obviously, there's a lot more complexity to the Nordic model, but that's the gist. So yes, your points about the profit motive ruining creativity and making people feel empty are well-taken. But it's the system of government that determines whether this leads to massive inequality or not.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think that the problem with taking down capitalism as a whole is that the golden pizza is offensive to almost everyone. Apart from the people who profit off of the spectacle of being bourgeois (a la Trump), the majority of the actual bourgeoisie would be equally appalled by the golden pizza, and I think that's precisely the same logic that lets them justify their own place of structural power. See most people, no matter how rich they are, feel financial pressure, they feel as if they are using their disposable income to better their family's lives. Most Americans, I think, see displays of wealth as a noveau rich thing, or as something to do when you're not actually that rich, and moreover, most wealthy people see their wealth as the means of making their children's lives better. Therefore, the golden pizza seems equally appalling to the rich, but it's not because it reveals the emptiness of wealth, but because it points at the fact that the wealth enable indulgence, which is an uncomfortable reality when your entire world view is of being 'upper middle class, but still things are tight sometimes' like the top 20-5% of income earners probably feel. No one feels rich. No one, apart from people who are realllly at the top, would say they can afford to drop 2 grand on a pizza. And it's not those really at the top that lobby against school integration, that drive the exclusionary structure of suburbs, that hold the majority of electoral power, it's that top 20%.    So, the problem comes -- how do you convince people to struggle against capital when they see their own capital not as a luxury but as a hard won means of securing their children's future?   I think if you said to the average American -- 'we're going to have communism', their first question would be 'will I get to keep my house?'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Great production as usual. Fundamentally flawed argument, ...as usual.  Fact 1: if it wasn't for capitalism a normal pizza would cost around $1,000! Let's say $10/hour for about 1,000 hours to plant, harvest and mill the grain, plant harvest and prepare tomatoes, cheese, etc., etc.,. But thanks to capitalism a pizza costs the average person about the same as s/he could earn in the time it takes to eat it and the pizza is far better quality than a single person could hope to produce in 1'000 hours of effort.  Fact 2: Re capitalism and the 'exploitation' of people in 3rd world countries. Capitalism targets _and finds_ the poorest people in the world and gives them money in exchange for work. It doesn't force them but gives them the choice of working although you will argue that they are in no position to negotiate the fact is that they are better off working than not. The only failure of capitalism (and every other mechanism we know of) is that it can't reach the parts of the world that are not stable enough for anyone to risk investing (capitalism) to build factories.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"against the 'argument':  > Capitalism as we know it is a devective eonomic system because, altough it's good at creatinf large amounts os wealth, it distributes that wealth in an incredibly inefficient way.  I imagine the argument would be to distribute wages in a more egalitarian manner, right? To avoid this being futile (by way of inflation) all prices have to be controlled.   Now a new problem rises: stores under capitalism sell things for different prices, which mean that apparantly there are different ideas on what the prices should be. if something in the new controlled pricing system is too cheap, it will run out and become the new comodity by trade, either directly, or by promise (let's say toilet-paper notes).   This becomes a new currency and now you're back where you started.

Take some of the money which lives in rich people's bank accounts not really doing much, and give it to everyone so that nobody can't afford basic necessities with a bit extra left over to alleviate the crushing tedium of existence. Obviously, a balance needs to be struck between making sure everyone has some spending power and having some money for the banks to use, because ethical investment banking is an incredibly important thing for making more of the money that we're going to give to people.

"I was laughing so much to the socrates bit. I think there are two flaws with capitalism (well three flaws). Edit; I have pretty much read f*ck all on this: -  1) We are social beings. And so any kind of reward that doesn't come from your peers, will feel shallow and meaningless. I.e. money printing is self-defeating. 2) Applying a numerical (capital) value to risk creates a false sense of security or even detachment from the real risk (hence 2007/2008 financial crash). Though I don't think anything can be done about risky behaviour as it appears to be human nature - controversially, it appears more men take greater risks than women...       ...though, to say this is a hardwired innate feature in males would be vastly over-simplifying. 3) Going from '1)' & '2)', the idea that 'bigger is better' is flawed. On a structural level I think capitalism creates over-centralisation of pretty much everything and in so-doing makes societies more critically dependant on central powers - and drains resources in order to do this. It is inefficient and creates an environment which reduces co-operation for things that humanity genuinely needs to deal with. I would argue it even reduces our conscious abilities. So the only way to maintain capitalism is by force.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The problem is that money never trickles down, it trickles UP. which I know sounds weird but it has been kind of proven that the vast majority of people spend more money when they have more, so it's actually in the capitalists interest that the employees have the ability to buy many goods which is why the minimum wage for anyone over the age of 18 should be raised to, I dunno, 20 bucks an hour? <_< >_> not that I happen to live in a country where that is in fact the case and it's usually rated one of the happiest countries in the world or anything.

"DISREGARD MARX.  Acquire Nitzan and Bichler.  Their capital-as-power framework supersedes both Marxian and neoclassical schools of political economy, exposing their underlying supernaturalism. Both assume that prices are like a distorted reflection of some non-material substance called 'value'. Marxians say this value comes from socially-necessary labour. Neoclassicals say it comes from subjective utility vs scarcity. They get the whole thing upside-down.  In reality, prices aren't a reflection of anything. There is no 'real' price of a good that's separate from the 'nominal' price. The only thing prices represent is the power of the price-makers, most of whom are capitalists. The agency for setting prices lies solely with them, not in some spectral realm of 'value' composed of either labour or utility.   In other words, money is power - not only metaphorically, but literally. Money is a technology for 'controlling human mobilisation', getting people to do one thing versus a different thing.   Correspondingly, capital is not the 'bottom-up' creation of either labour or utility, it's the 'top-down' creation of the powerful. Capital is the symbolic quantification of the power held by capitalists to control the social fabric.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'll play devil's advocate here:  > 'The extreme economic inequalities of society are laughably unjustifiable'  What makes them unjustifiable? In what sense? If an economic system exists, and that existence breads such inequality, what is unjustifiable about it? It just is. Are floods that kill people 'unjustifiable'? They are just a force of nature that exist, and while it kills some people, its source (rain, rivers, etc) also provides irrigation for crops that make humanity possible. If we assume an economy can't be micromanaged and controlled in a way that it can actually work, isn't the only way to think about it as a 'force of nature' that we just try to control as much as we can?   Just like a flood is not 'unjustifiable', but it sucks and we try our hardest to control it and prevent it (e.g building dams, building better alerting systems, and more); maybe economic inequalities aren't 'unjustifiable', but they suck and we can try our hardest to control and prevent them. But just like we don't try to devise a new global irrigation system to replace rains and rivers (because we'd suck at it and fuck up the world), we wouldn't completely replace the complex capitalistic economic system with a new one like communism/socialism/etc (because we'd suck at it and fuck up society and the economy, and there have been plenty of such examples so far). Makes sense?  > 'Capitalism as we know it is a defective economic system because, although it's good at creating large amounts of wealth it distributes wealth in an incredibly inefficient way (not the capacity to maximize total wealth, but the capacity to maximize human happiness)'  Is it just for an economic system to determine how wealth is distributed? There are a lot of other concepts involved in an economy other than just 'create wealth' and 'distribute wealth'. You have concepts like rights; property (private and public, personal and non-personal, etc); freedom; voluntary choice; coercion; etc, which aren't just related to economy. You know, like what the 'taxation is theft!' people always talk about. You can't just say 'Oh, this economic system distributes wealth in a way I like' and call it quits; if it contradicts other principles and becomes unjust then you have to think of something else.  > 'Should the economy serve humanity, or should humanity serve the economy?'  Does the economy even have a possibility to (successfully) do anything else other than serve itself (and only serve humanity incidentally)? Again, just like rains and rivers don't serve anybody other than themselves (and that's their only purpose), but humans devise ways for it to serve us; the economy only serves itself, and we humans devise ways for it to serve us too (usually with the involvement of the state, but other times via culture, via social movements, etc).  > 'A good economic system produces the most happiness for the people who are a part of it'  Utilitarianism vs deontologism. If a system 'produces the most happiness for the people who are part of it', but it came to fruition by an act that we'd call unjust (or it perpetuates unjust acts), is it still the right system?  Is there a way for a different economic system to replace capitalism that 'produces the most happiness for the people who are part of it', but does so justly, without breaking any human rights, without needing any immoral act (e.g stealing, forcing someone to do something against their will, etc), and it ending up working in the end?   Most criticisms of 'replacing capitalism' (usually with communism/socialism) fall under that umbrella: They are either unjust systems, or the process of going from capitalism to them involves unjust acts (the other criticisms being that they don't work, but well that's specific to the system in question, it's not general)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'Let's throw philosophy in the trash' - *proceeds to drop a shelf of clearly unread books on the floor*  Mate, maybe if you actual read the old wisdom, you would find it helpful. You can't reasonably claim that philosophy is nothing besides confusing jargon, when it is abundantly clear you haven't read the works.  If you don't want a $2000 pizza, don't buy it. Capitalism allows you to vote with your wallet. If you do want the golden pizza, and you value the experience more than $2000, you buy it, and guess what, the vendor values that same pizza at less than $2000, you just experience the virtue of capitalism: positive sum interaction.  Now imagine a communist utopia, you, the customer, must be served, and the food you receive is paid for by the government. However, this time, you, the customer, have no vote on the quality of the experience, so the vendor serves you shit and you have to cop it. You have no avenue for non-confrontational recourse, and indeed raising your concern regarding Government restaurants will net you a hate-speech violation and a trip for yourself and your loved ones to the local Gulag.

"So wouldn't the implication of wanting/waiting to see capitalism fail be to oppose anything that makes it stable, like financial regulation?  Or would the failure of capitalism produce a power vacuum for the most awful, reactionary forces around?   Or is the problem not 'capitalism' as if it were some kind of monolith, but about the balance between/aspects of capitalism and socialism?  I think the case you're making is against NEOLIBERAL capitalism, not capitalism overall.    Capitalism is good because it provides for markets, allows for flexibility, and gives people the psychological security derived from ownership.  Socialism is good because it reins in our worst insticts and ensures a minimum standard of living.  Capitalism and socialism need one another for balance.

"I feel like this video wasn't quite as intellectually honest as your other videos. For one, you say you don't understand economics very well, yet still make economic arguments, some of which are questionable. You barely explore the fundamental purpose of economic systems, which is to allocate labor and capital in a way that most efficiently aligns with the moral values of society. The problem of how to allocate scarce resources is too often handwaved away by socialists. I think you owe it to yourself and your audience to actually understand the problems of capitalism through an economic framework, rather through a Marxist one.   Also, some of those counter points were just straw men. Socialists still haven't come up with an actually workable way of allocating labor and resources effectively. At best, a socialist will mutter about 'market socialism' and worker co-ops and refuse to expand any further or provide details. It's really intellectually lazy. I mean, I do believe there are solutions to these issues, but few leftists seem interested in finding them.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Definitely agreed that socialism cannot come about without the failure of international capitalism, but I still cannot look forward to that time.  There is going to be A LOT of human misery during that time, and during the transition.  All systems eventually fail, though, as the course of human history tells us.  My money is on Climate Change eventually leading to that collapse as systems begin to strain and buckle under the weight of capitalist industry.  I can see Neo-Liberalism being replaced briefly by exterminism (for those who have read Four Futures), before socialism taking over in order for mankind to survive.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

And attempts to create such pure markets tend to just end in totalitarianism for a multitude of reasons.

"I am a big fan of your work, but I was honestly disappointed. The first video on this was quite brilliant, and I have watched it multiple times. This one didn't seem to address much anything too new from the previous video and videos you've made in the past that weren't directly related to capitalism. I think you could have put significantly more emphasis on how 'stuff' isn't necessarily a product of capitalism, but rather a product of labor. Labor has existed since before capitalism and will exist after capitalism, so 'stuff' will always exist. Maybe this stuff will be different, but it will exist. I did like the point about Tetris as I didn't actually know that came out of the Soviet Union. I think you could have put more examples of this.  I also was largely let down with Tatiana Tankikova. She to me looked like a brilliant new character on part with Tabby Catgirl. However, leaving her entire role as an extremely small seen saying she'd defend Stalin and calling you a fascist was a let off. I think it's fair acknowledging their were some really horrific things that happened in early socialist states, but it may have been a good opportunity to have Tatiana explain some of the positives that may have come from the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, etc. We both know they exist. The idea being we take the things that they did right or had good ideas and discard the obvious failures for how we plan a future socialist society.  The other thing is something that tbf you've touched on quite a bit on other videos and I think that may have been why you left it out. I think you could have made some good points on how while electoral politics aren't revolutionary they may at least allow us to avoid it getting worse and even shift the Overton Window to the left. More left leaning countries almost always have stronger communist parties. That really does help no matter how much the elitist wanna disagree. You could have also pointed out certain ideas such as that Yanis Varoufakis has spoken of which will allow a steady transition in to communism as automation takes place. I believe the idea is to tax corporations and the wealthy significantly higher than they currently are where this money then goes into a fund which will be used for a substantial UBI in the future making work unnecessary for the majority of the population once automation reaches certain stage of efficiency. I did really enjoy the jokes at the end with Tabby. That was genuinely cleverly done and is one reason why she's such a great character. I hope to see her back and would like to see some expansion to the character of Tatiana.  I really do like your videos, so I hope I wasn't being too harsh. You still make among the best leftist videos on youtube, and I think you're are doing amazing work of both informing people on these topics as well as making them entertaining.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Capitalism is apparently really inept at providing voice lessons to trannies and can do little more than make poor efforts at a generic falsetto only part of the time. What it is apparently phenomenal at is allocating enough R&D funding to tranny surgical operations as well as medical talent to perform such operations as well as the infrastructure needed to make sure that people don't die in the process.  ...As for happiness, Jonathan Haidt's research suggests that impoverished prostitutes in India report only marginally lower ratings of life satisfaction than people from wealthy countries. We tend to perceive happiness and life satisfaction based on upswings and downswings. There's the oft repeated example of where someone who wins the lottery vs becoming paralyzed wouldn't be appreciably happier in either case after roughly one year passes after the events.  So what does this all mean? Possibly that felicity isn't the only aspect of human well-being and that happiness as a condition is dependent on things secular to economics. Therefore it doesn't really make that much to argue for or against capitalism on grounds of reported levels of life-satisfaction, rather it's better to gauge whether capitalism is more or less desirable based on which countries people are most willing to move to and least willing to leave of their own volition.

When we stop comparing capitalism to authoritarian communist regimes and start comparing it with its potential, we can move past capitalism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Great video! Wish there was more of Tatiana.  Also I think you're mistaken when you say that capitalism is inefficient. Capitalism is really really efficient at what it's supposed to do. And it does that really really well. And that is not to maximise happiness or freedom for all but to maximise profits.  Capitalism never was, never is, or never will be about anything other than profit margin, specifically maximising that profit margin. Everything else is just a side-effect, intended or unintended.  Which is one of the reasons why we need to do away with it. Capitalism's objectives are not in line with the objectives of the people. Happiness, freedom, glamour, whatever are all secondary to the primary goal of the system of capitalism, while for humans the happiness, the freedom, the having stuff, having shiny stuff part is the primary goal.  What matters to people is access to what they need, the stuff. But under capitalism access is regulated and limited. This is because Capitalism instead prioritises the profitability part. We don't give everyone gold nails cuz we physically can't, but because its 'unprofitable'.  Capitalism must go, and if we sit around and wait for things to change it'll be too late. We're on the clock; saving the environment isn't particularly profitable as nature doesn't pay you for not destroying her. In fact it's the opposite, exploiting natural resources is profitable. So if we don't stop capitalism soon it'll be too late for us to have stuff like stable climactic conditions conducive to the continual progress of human technological civilisation.  It's a huge misconception that capitalism is about happiness from stuff, it's about how to profit off of giving you the stuff.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Anarchocapitalism and the neoliberal model are flawed models because, as you correctly pointed out, they are great at creating wealth but are bad at distributing it fairly. And they appear to become worse and worse at it over time. Communism is not an alternative because it requires removing peoples rights, e.g. that to their property, which requires a totalitarian government and that subsequently unfallibly leads to a corrupt and brutal fascist regime. Capitalism is the best we got so far, yet not the be-all end-all. But with growing inequality, as history has shown, the chance of 'guillotines being built' increases. Unfortunately society seems to be ever more clustered and divided, so instead of working on a sensible approach to solve humanities problems our time and efforts are wasted on constant bickering and fighting between interest groups that basically want to solve the same underlying problems, yet only appear to be willing to see and fix certain symptoms of it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

By doing so we have both become accustomed to its luxuries, while simultaneously taking on appropriate 'virtues' necessary not just for success, but survival. Of course, such 'virtues' would be derived from the core values of the neoliberal ideology, which have become so deeply ingrained in us. How can we successfully construct a fairer economic system that is fundamentally opposed to these 'virtues' overnight, through means of revolution. Surely then, shouldn't we instead be aiming for gradual change? Of course though this is no easy feat.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The criticism of capitalism is easy. I think it's important that people understand problems like inequality and the emptiness of glamour.  But why are you still talking about Revolution? What can possibly be achieved by revolution that can't be achieved by democracy in this country? With enough popular backing, communists could overtake and amend the Constitution. And frankly, I think it's a horrible idea and would inevitably go wrong. We shouldn't be engaging in country-wide communist experience in the US; way too much could go wrong so why not try a smaller country? And revolution just increases the chances things will go horribly wrong.  Why can't we change gradually? Most changes are destined to fail, and I think we are best off by going slowly and filtering out the bad policies over time. And this is sort of what you recommend we do while we are awaiting the conditions for communist revolution. The irony is that, if effective, those slower changes will weaken the need and urgency felt for revolution; although personally, I view this as a good thing.  But I would go one step further and say we shouldn't just support policies that appear on the surface to lessen income inequality. This is essentially the purpose of economics. In fact, studies about what level of money promotes happiness is part of economics. Economics isn't fundamentally about how to produce the most money. In practice, it often is about exactly that, but the core of economics is in utility, whether we define that as human happiness, or meaning and fulfillment, or whatever. I think that only game in town is to gradually use the tools of science and rational thinking to approach more effective institutions for maximizing utility. It's far from perfect, but I see everything else as a short-sighted shortcut.   Ultimately, are lives could be vastly transformed by the existence of superhuman artificial intelligence, which could be with us sooner than expected. It's possible that levels as high as 90% unemployment will ensue as artificial intelligence exceeds the ability of humans at both manual and intellectual labor. Wealth could increase exponentially, and inequality will hit unprecedented levels, and we will be forced as a society to completely restructure, likely moving towards a more communistic model. So if we are waiting for anything, we are waiting for that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

This sort of thing, I think, should be what every leftist should strive for, to bridge the gap between the boring academic jargon and the common day-to-day observations we make. I would love to see more of this sort of stuff, where people take critiques of capitalism that exist only in books, and find ways to make them relatable to everyday people.

"Though I don't like some of the points, and I think capitalism has a use to keep us more sane (honestly not joking). I most admit that consumerism is the problem, not capitalism. We must use capitalism as competition but we musn't consume stupidly or in excess to the point where we will kill for products. A good example for what I call murder for merchandise is Black Friday shopping where we are made to believe blindly that after these products are marked up and then discounted back to a normal price for profit we benefit in holiday generosity. Personally when it comes to distribution of wealth there is only two things we must do, cut the budget of the US military and increase the budget of education in public schools funded solely on the taxes given up by the people. It is proven that the higher education an American gains in their primary to secondary career leads to success.   The USA pays more for the military than it does for the military. Everyone goes to school on average but the military only has between 2 and 3 million people in it working including reserves. So why pay more for this group but not pay an equal amount of money or more for the 74 million in between pre k and 12th grade and 16 million in colleges and universities? Why pay the majority less. Especially because the US treats so many of its military retirees like dog shit. The reason I bring this up is because black communities have a low quality of life because there are more drop outs due to how the education system works and isn't made more  accommodating for black students that are statistically more likely to be children of drop outs that also had troubles with the education system.    I must say this. I'm only 16 about to be 17 and I know I have a lot to learn but if you respond please try to be constructive to help me learn.

"I think that there is a marked distinction between Soviet Russia and today's living standards, not simply because of economics but because of technology. Technology has and seems set to advance in an accelerating fashion, which means that when we talk in socialism of 'seizing the means of production' the means today are massively more powerful than ever before.   We have automatons and 3d printers - in that way, perhaps communism in the near future could avoid the harsh, work fetishistic and severe necessities of running a 20th century socialist state when the capitalist contemporaries at the time had excess.  Today, I would say, more than before, those excesses seem much less a joy and much more a crime because of the reasons this great video mentioned, but also because it seems that even the availability of excess is much more an unjustified concept in the age of relative, (theoretical) plenty that we have today in the 21st century, only 50+ years later.  We all realise we could have luxuries, with tech like the way we have it on the scene. In regards not just to living but even excesses, it seems hard to justify the price prohibitions we have today, and socialism/communism/anarchism whatever, would probably be much more the way Contra or anyone else would find palatable, ie. actual Contra-thought Champagne Socialism.

The book is good because Mason comes from a similar angle that you do, acknowledging all the Marxist thought and academic level stuff while showing how this issue can be thought of in layman's terms, which I appreciate.  Also, while I agree that reform alone can't solve all our problems, the whole thing about waiting for capitalism to fail confuses me. Hasn't it already failed? I assume when people say that they are talking more about the political situation rather than the economic one. I mean I get the thrust behind the argument and I'm on board but it seems like it would be worth discussing in detail what 'revolution' would actually mean depending on the context of what actually happens or is likely to happen.

"I would take qualms with your argument that capitalism is defective because it distributes that wealth in an inefficient way. The first lie of bourgeois economics is that capitalism is a system of distribution. With this lie, then a comparison of the systems can take place. But the systems can't really be compared because a comparison implies a commonality. The purpose of capitalism is to augment money, to make more money from the money one has. The purpose of a planned economy is to meet needs. The truth is that in a market economy nobody coordinates, no one worries about the needs of others (only insofar as they can be exploited to make a sale). Market subjects have other concerns in mind when they get to producing. Everyone offers something on the market and the whole coordination consists of whether the salesman has success or not. If the salesman has success, he has success; if not, then he takes his unsold things home with him and cannot sell them. Where is there any coordination? One hits on a solvent need and by chance has success; another strikes out and fails, possibly even becomes destitute due to his failed attempt to produce and sell. Only: what is coordinated here? Nothing at all is coordinated here! In truth, the alleged service of coordination/distribution does not take place, because needs are actually not respected at all. A seller looks for a solvent demand; needs that are not backed up by money do not count as needs and therefore go unmet. The market does not coordinate existing needs and production, but the salesman in the market sees what solvent needs can be taken advantage of. And also, the other way around, for the buyer on a trip to the market, the need itself does not guide his decision to purchase, but what he actually gets is the commodity he can afford in keeping with his wallet. Whether he buys those things that he then buys because he perhaps can't afford better, so that instead of the quality product he buys trash, or whether his need goes completely neglected - this is very much the question. With the whole coordination, on one side stands production, which never wants to meet needs, and on the other hand stands not needs at such, but purchasing power.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"When capital goes into crisis and the common prole doesn't have a good analysis of what not to do (i.e. you seem opposed to Leninism etc) then the revolution has a good chance of failure to go in a correct direction to actually solve the problems of capitalism because the revolution has a risk of being incoherent.  When the crisis of capitol arises in a context of a left with no (or weak) structures of revolutionary potential in place even a left with perfect analysis will fail to be effective (by way of being strong enough) in bringing about revolution. If a workers movement fails in this context counter revolution could turn fascist.   So what we MUST do is Educate Organize and Agitate. Respect a diversity of tactics and try to find UNFULFILLED roles to fill. If nobody else is doing it and you are capable that is the most important thing you could be doing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I am not aware of any country that is using straight capitalism. That is a cruel and cold world. The capitalist/socialist hybrid is the current base for most first world countries. In my opinion, this is because being a caring human being enters into the equation. Humans tend to not like it when other humans suffer. (...and kittens, puppies, emus, and polar bears.) So rather than debate if capitalism is bad I would like to see a discussion on how to get the majority of wage earners at the point where basic needs are met. In this video it is represented as the $60k mark. Then see if we can change the social programs to be more focused as a safety net for anyone that has a life-event which might push them below and help them get back into the working economy. We get our s*** in order first then work on other countries. But that might mean imposing our will on sovereign countries and people.  I am not touching that discussion with a ten foot pole or a $2,000 pizza. Until then, peace to all my fellow humans.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"One question always pressed is 'who will do the shitty jobs in a post-capitalist world?' A contradiction lies in peoples' unconscious minds, especially those who pose the question. If you look at the 'shitty' jobs compared to the 'non-shitty' jobs (paralleling with blue collar to white collar jobs) most of the shitty ones pay less. That means that there's something intrinsic to peoples' motivation to the shitty jobs. They like doing them. We need to wake ourselves up to the revelation that many people actually like their work. Being that we're nurtured into capitalism, it may be difficult to understand. We're told that we have to be driven to work, motivated with abstract rewards and frightened with discipline. Even if not everyone is equipped to doing particular jobs, anyone can be made to understand the joy of seeing the direct impact their labor has on society. This is why the major drive into the white collar 'non-shitty' jobs has to be money. Polls show that a big chunk of the workforce think the world will do without their work or a significant portion of it. That's the non-shitty well paid sector. Suddenly it seems as though the shitty and non-shitty labels should be reversed. Low paying jobs that vench off further from the capitalist model of short term self gain will contain a negative stigma around them and be made to seem like the natural order is that no one would be willing to do them. The higher you go up the ladder and closer to the core of this system (capital and profit) the more you have to be 'driven' to do your idiotic pointless work and the more willing you are to continue the cycle onto others (through fashionable consumption). We need to be disciplined in some way under capitalism. If you enjoy the production aspect of your life, you're gonna be in a rough deal in terms of the consumption aspect, and visa verca. Of course there are exceptions as there are well off people who do enjoy what they do, but I still stress these are exceptions.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Socialism without capitalism is communism.  Capitalism without socialism is fascism.  We need a social democracy which is a balance.    The argument shouldn't be over capitalism but rather what capitalism is morphing into.  The type of capitalism we've allowed to run amok is now bordering on fascism.  Unfettered crony capitalism has concentrated all the wealth to the top .1% while 1 out of 2 workers in America today earn 30k or less.  This is simply unsustainable.    If we don't rise up and stop the corporate coup...we'll forever be the commoners we've been warned of becoming.   'The American fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity ....They claim to be super-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the state and the power of the market simultaneously, they may keep the common man in eternal subjection.'

"If you want to know how to end Capitalism the answer is simple. You need to look at where the profit motive has ceased being a driver of innovation and push for nationalization of said industry. You can't do it wholesale government take over of every industry and have it work out with out damaging innovation.   Take Space. The profit motive is driving the industry to do cool stuff regarding the future of space travel. We are figuring out how to reuse rocket parts and put cool sportscars in Space. Compare that to internet service providers. Instead of innovating on behalf of the customer private industry is just raising prices and attempting to lower the quality of service you receive for the price you pay now. So the government should take over as the public's interest in getting internet service is no longer whats driving the decisions of the lizards at the top.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I have friends who are vietnamese and this idealization of communism will always be a disrespectful white american thing to them...  I appreciate that contra discusses stuff, but I feel like there's still not really anyone speaking to that voice of second or third generation kids who have to deal with the trauma of this background. It's kind of true that the general tone of discourse just skips straight to communism and doesn't acknowledge the depths of the crimes committed in these countries. Most of the discussion in for people who don't come from those backgrounds by people who don't come from those backgrounds and doesn't know how to tackle it. Here contra touches on it but i wonder how people who'd grown up knowing the dark legacy it left would react to her tone My friends are anticapitalist to be clear, but they've expressed not understanding why socialism isn't good enough. It is true that communism is usually the focus, the message, and the aesthetic. People who aren't 'tankies' still gleefully appropriate the aesthetics that represent intergenerational trauma to a lot of people... I don't know how bad that is, but I think it shows what my friends mean when they associate communism with privileged whiteness. These are all just hypotheticals to us that we can wave away and appropriate and joke about.  I think marxist literature is valuable reading and probably a lot of other communist theory...

"Eh a technocratic socialism is something I can get behind. Efficiency in doing things is a pretty admirable thing to aspire for humanity to achieve however maybe we don't wanna invest resources into doing extremely terrible things as efficiently as possible. Like I theorise that there is this limit breaking point with capitalism, where the downtrodden unwashed masses become washed and educated but nevertheless downtrodden. A state that exists in constant oppression but that actual oppression is so benign that people resign themselves to their fates. A freedom in a cage scenario. A permanent dictatorship without a coup or revolution. A cultural stopping point that dooms humanity forever by making us noncompetitive and dull, void of ambition. This system cannot be achieved until there is a one world government be it a loose confederation of mutually beneficial trading partners or an actual top down system. I don't think smashing the fash will stop this happening. I actually only see it increasing the speed it happens. I think the only way we do get around this end game point is taking active roles in our respective governments and energising the entire human race so we see the larger picture without giving into authoritarianism. This however increases unification and therefore makes this cultural dead end more likely. Perhaps a solution is a return to a citystate model. Where every city is unified together to be the best city it can possibly be and compete with other cities for glory. This fragmented unity may actually be the safest route to an efficient system. So perhaps the best way forward is a decentralised government that doesn't have the power to ruin the human race's potential while still prioritising efficiency.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"There is perhaps a misnomer with the title of 'Capitalism'.  Most people do not strive for capital or increase their capital. People muddle through their lifes trying to make it better. One of the undeniable factors in the improvement of peoples lives is the celebration and entrenchment of Bourgeois Virtues/markets (I highly recommend Deirdre McCloskey book series of the same name.)  Which is what I think ContraPoints hits on here.   So the fundamental question to me is how do we preserve markets and address inequalities?  Because a lot of the perversions we see today are functions of government/state power (not making a libertarian argument).

"There's an inadequacy to the way you address the problems with previous non-capitalist regimes. Until you or someone else develops an alternative, communism and capitalism are the only economic systems which societies can choose. We can't be certain that nothing of that sort will ever be proposed, and it might be good to keep the problems with capitalism from fading from our minds in case that ever happens, but nothing of apparent merit has been so far. As it stands, the only alternative to capitalism is a regime similar to the soviet union, Cuba, or any number of other communist dystopias.  And no, socialism is not that alternative. That word is used in so many different ways by so many different people that it's effectively meaningless, but everything I've ever heard called socialism was either a highly regulated form of capitalism or simply communism.

"Very strange that you actually make videos explaining white nationalist talking points to 'debate' them but immediately dismiss and denounce 'Stalin defenders' as a joke. Past communist countries were not 'shitty'. In fact they were far better for the poorest members of society than any capitalist country. The Soviet Union provided universal education, healthcare, and employment. Wealth was distributed incredibly fairly, with the top 10% not ever 'owning' much more than 20% of the wealth. No individual could personally accumulate and control billions of dollars worth of wealth. There were also no economic 'crises' in the usual sense of the term. Production was carried out primarily on the basis of need rather than profit. The millions of women who were plunged into unemployment and poverty and forced into prostitution after the overthrow of the Soviet system probably wouldn't take too kindly to calling the society which prevented such social ills 'shitty'. Pretty sure a majority of sex trafficked women in Europe come from the former socialist bloc of countries in the east. If the system was so 'shitty', why did it's overthrow lead to that? A majority of soviet citizens voted to KEEP the Soviet Union in 1991. Their voices were ignored by the likes of Yeltsin whose political rise was bank rolled by America.  Why dismiss these arguments and historical facts as a damn joke but take nazis seriously ?? Also, fun fact: STALINS SOVIET UNION STOPPED THE FUCKING NAZIS!!!!!!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I really like your video. A boring point on stuff. Your cell phone, and computers n' stuff, are now used to offload cognitive functions. Ya know. To make stuff better and easier for you. But this means that your devices, your stuff, becomes infused with your cognition. It becomes part of your 'mind'. And so, this stuff is pretty essential to us. Allowing it to be commercialized by corporations (stealing your data and selling it), and authoritarians turning it into communal property are fundamentally an invasion of your mind.

"Ok, so a question I don't know the answer to (and really, the answer I was hoping Contra did know, because she's smarter than me) is this:  Rather than abolishing capitalism, can we modify our current system so it isn't so back-breakingly awful?  Like, I'm pretty sure that we have enough wealth to provide universal healthcare, universal housing, free tuition and all that jazz, and still leave the Billionares enough money so that they can eat Gold Pizza while sitting on a chair made of whale foreskin on board one of their three massive yachts.  The Gold Pizza is only immoral because other people can't afford the $2 pizza.  Except I guess the two objections to this are a) we *don't* have the wealth to do this globally, and that even if everyone in the first world had the stuff they needed, we'd still have clothing sweatshops and suicidal electronics workers....or b) providing the basics to everyone under the current system is more than the environment can sustain.  So yeah, I dunno the answer to that.  Someone help me out here and explain it to me.  Preferably with neon lights and a range of wigs.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think your approach to understanding Soviet or Chinese communism is flawed. The problems you portray with these societies were not caused by communism, they existed before communism in these places. Austerity, scarcity, conformity, etc were more present in Tsarist Russia or Japanese-occupied China than the societies that succeeded them. In every way Soviet communism was an improvement for the Soviet Union, a region that, when founded in 1922, was almost entirely agrarian and extremely underdeveloped. Fast forward 40 years and they were an industrialized nation with a drastically higher standard of living, rate of literacy, full employment, and record breaking scientific accomplishments (first nation in space, anyone?)   It's a common liberal tendency to compare everything to the United States, forgetting that, globally speaking, there are entire capitalist continents that would have viewed life in the post-40's Soviet Union as paradise. Liberals compare communism to a handful of countries in the imperialist core that were wealthy long before communism emerged in the east, exclusively in poor, commonly semi-feudal societies. Marxists understand the development of society as a historical process, one which soviet communism drove forward at one of the fastest rates in history.   Of course these places weren't perfect, they had many defects, as any experimental system would. But to ignore their accomplishments and throw them out with the bath water because of their (often exaggerated) mistakes does nothing for us.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I like that you take a stab at communism and defend 'stuff'. I feel much more at home, being educated about the way capitalism works in a university. While pointing out these unmatchings between generation of wealth and overall human happiness is spot on, I don't know any way to give an answer to this concern. The only thing I know is something called the universal basic income model. Basically, if a country has enough money from the start (good luck on that btw, which is a huge obstacle in its way), this model proposes that you just give enough money to everyone in order for them to have their basic living costs covered. Studies actually found that giving money to poor people generally doesn't lead them to buying more alcohol or drugs. Giving free money to people may boost their productivity, but then again this is still built on capitalism's roots. Would be fun to hear what you think about this.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
