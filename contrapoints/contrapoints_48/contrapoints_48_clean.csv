"When I binge like ten ContraPoints videos, I sometimes wonder how her house looks in person. Like, does it look like a film set?

"This reminds me of a conversation Scout had with her aunt, I forget her name, in To Kill A Mockingbird. Scout, like Tabby, may have been a girl, but she was no LADY.  What should a young woman aspire to? A spunky, foul mouthed person is no less feminine than a regal, dress wearing lady. But she is more abrasive, less refined?  A proper woman should have properly explored every facet of her personality. In the end, you have to understand both sides, I guess.  I'm empowered to express my opinion because I'm a cis man, and apparently I have a HUGE part in this conversation, Natalie said so. Lucky me! ","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Ok, I love your channel. Just makes me broaden my horizons and think about many things I never did.  As a cis woman, I've often wondered about genders, even when I was a kid and wanted to dress like a guy, to see how it is. Now this video made me think about the following: what is actually the essence of the female? It's obviously not our bodies, or how we were brought up. It's not our voices, or our breasts. It's not our character or attitude. It's not the supposed ability to give birth (as more and more women find that they can't conceive nowadays, me included). It's not a certain sexuality. These are all variables. What is the thing that makes me a woman? What makes me similar to other women - both cis and trans? What unites us? I don't believe in a having a soul, but then what is it? According to some members of society, a woman is only a woman when she has a certain level of attractiveness according to someone, but I believe that this is something forced on us externally and do not consider it a real criterion.  So what is it? What's the real essence of a woman? If there were two brains in jars, hooked to a computer, how would we tell, and would it matter, which one was the female one, and would there be any actual difference? I'd really love to hear someone's opinion on this.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I was recalling this video the other day and it struck me how much the very core of intellectual debates nowadays is primarily filtered and analysed through aesthetic lenses. 'Antifeminist calmly dismantles feminism'-type videos/circlejerks, the smooth and collected speech of people explaining why racism c'mon guys it isn't so bad is it, then the instant invalidation of any arguments made with any shred of underlying emotion or the mocking of any minority of marginalized group when they display discontent with any given situation. It is first and foremost an aesthetic judgement. The argument is not that important; as long as the person sounds distanced and presents their ideas in a soothing, ASMR-like monotone, it will be a valid point of view. You do have outliers who are more on the failed stand-up comedian end of the spectrum like LaPaglia, but it's only natural that the easily-triggered snowflake-conservatives will want vary and to find the odd avatar to their habitual rants and fits.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"My personal experience tells me that gender identity is not a performance, or a role that one plays in society. It's not a social construct, but rather, it's a part of reproductive biology. We instinctively make efforts to identify the sex of people we meet, and we're driven a little crazy when we can't (see any 'It's Pat' segment from Saturday Night Live). But that instinct doesn't just apply to others, it applies to ourselves, too. And the information we seek (as to our own sex) is already inscribed in the brain, biologically, before we're even born.   It makes sense to think that knowing both our own sex and the sex of those we meet is supposed to affect which mates we're attracted to, but that obviously isn't always the deciding factor. It does seem to work that way for most people, though.   But the point is, my female identity isn't linked to any social construct. Not to girly clothes, or mannerisms, or role. If I could wave a magic wand and turn myself into a woman (a recurring fantasy of mine), I'd still mostly wear the same kind of clothes. I'd keep my hair short. I'd walk with a masculine gait. Like I already do. Because if I didn't like to behave that way, I already wouldn't. I'm a very masculine woman trapped in a man's body. You'd think that'd make things easier, but it doesn't; it's still maddening. Worse, transitioning would be less helpful, because with the technology of today, what does it even mean to transition from a man into a butch lesbian? It's pretty much only the parts that I want to change (like my hairline, voice, height, bone structure, and proportions) that I can't. And so I'm stuck waiting for the technology to improve.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I totally have that kind of inner dialogue with myself. A lot. I'm not arguing with myself as much anymore though, cause I've already found my happy (actually conflicted) middle ground. I'm not a trans woman but I relate to a lot of that social aspect (in general) cause of my detransition from ftm. I'm still happy with most of the things testosterone gave me, but I realised I am not and was never a man. I really love being a woman now, although some things suck about it.   But I don't pass for shite. That phrase about bearded women with deep voices made me chuckle cause that's where I'm at now in life. And I love it. I love my voice, my beard, my vagina and my wide hips. I just miss my boobs. So that's the only medical detransition procedure I actually want to do (except I did go off the hrt as well). As in breast reconstruction to 'reverse' my top surgery. But except from my boobs, I also miss being seen as a woman in public. The fuck did I throw that away for? Now I can't have it back again. Not without sacrificing parts of my body that bring me comfort and help me sleep at night. And I know I can't do that.   If it's not clear, I'm not against anyone transitioning. I'm not even clearly against *me* having transitioned. I empathise with trans women. Cause at least I now understand how uncomfortable (and sometimes scary) it can often be to be read as a gnc (cis) man to strangers when you're actually a woman. That's a new kind of lump in my throat. Walking around in public with a beard and boobs in the same, neatly thought-out, feminine outfit has me shaking my own damn head about how I ended up here and where the fuck I'm heading in life. I love the way I look, but I hate the social consequences of it.  Ultimately I did decide to stay non-passing. I mean, if I can cope with the social implications of that in the long run. And that's what I'm mostly debating with myself about.   *Is it worth it, to really ditch the option of ever looking like a woman again, because I now love my masculinised body? Yeah... yes, it is.* Cause achieving self-love was my ultimate goal of transitioning, and somehow I reached it in detransition. Approval of others will never triumph self-love. But I don't think it will ever stop being painful, cause it's still a huge loss. I was a woman, and I miss her. Even though I've always been her and still am, hidden in plain sight.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is definitely Natalie's most challenging video. The theme of the video is pushed by the viewer actually understanding how to interpret it. If you don't understand where she's going with it, it would be difficult to begin to understand it. I am in love with it and put it up there with Incels and Are Traps Gay as my favorites of hers. This will be a difficult one for trans women to watch as it reaffirms the issues presented to them. However, while it will definitely hurt them emotionally for a day or so, I think it is more important to allow this message to be extended to the larger, cis population.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm a cis woman who has had difficulty with feeling like I'm not always feminine enough. Though it's highly unlikely I'll ever be mistaken for a man, my fears of even appearing manly have often stopped me in the past from playing male characters in school plays, just incase I'm nearly too convincing and people start to see me as masculine when I only wanted to be seen as feminine. It's not the same thing as what trans women feel but I sympathise with how they do feel that urge to be always taken as female and become more feminine than cis women. I think it's a hard line to walk between the freedom you want to have to be yourself at all times and the desire to be perceived as feminine at all times because just being a woman doesn't always mean being feminine and not all women want to be feminine either. But the most secure and confident feminine women can also express their masculinity too when they feel they should. That's why Disneys Mulan is one of my heroes.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I LIVE FOR THIS VIDEO  As for myself as a trans woman I LOVE this video as it echoed the two-ness that I experience everyday that I hate to admit to myself. Aesthetics matter to me because they matter to everyone else I'm trying to convince I am what I am while simultaneously I want to push who I really am rather than who I am percieved to be. I want to remain analogous in my presentation because I want to be like 'everybody else' but I want to stay distinct in order to promote to me-ness that is me. Trying to accomplish this in practice is super difficult. It's so much fun dressing like a barbie and showing up to fighting game tournaments and hip hop show. 'Thanks! I hate it!' - Lindsey Ellis. And even coming to terms with that...  I like looking like a barbie, but I hate that thag is how I want to present myself knowing that it is a shallow repetition of 'womanhood' from the dress, the makeup, even my mannerisms. This two-ness its stifling and stressful and while this fails as a dialect, it succeeds as a study of character. Like the play/film 'The Sunset Limited'   I posted this similar response to letstalkaboutstuff, but I wanted to let you know as well. One must be objective in order to delineate what is truth and feeling. And the real T is that we all experience and that is why we feel some type of way when its put in front of us. I know I did and immediately was like 'damn, how much if my trans-ness is me and what I feel ik expected to perform?' It haunts me. I could be tabby, but then.... the eyes..... shallow, yes. But same thing for me being a person of color. How much is me and how much is my performance? Worse so for you because of your celebrity having to perform for people like me and those who are NOT me on top of the two-ness of the trans life. Well, such is life.   Anyways, love love love it and thank thank thank you so so so much. Please dont stop. Keep it coming. Just like this and more. Educate without question or pause.  P.S. Cis people should watch it to gain this understanding of self conflict to produce a product THEY are willing or even able to digest.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

But in reality, the two are not only personalities that you see within the trans community, but battling ideas within the minds of many trans people. I, myself, struggle being a feminine trans guy, knowing that I cant wear a crop top and booty shorts and still be expected to be called 'sir' be strangers. The battle between being who you truly are but also limiting your true self can be contradicting but is a very real part of the trans experience that is often swept under the rug.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Edit: as a cis woman I can say womanhood feels like a cage we are trying to reappropriate. Its pushed upon us even when we try to run away from it. That's why a lot of us are angry even when marginalized. Because men dont stop waving our womanhood in front of our faces even when we try to throw it away. And they use that womanhood as a form of oppression that they dont even realize is oppressing themselves as well. And btw part of the cage is the whole having babies situation.

"I am not a transwoman, but still, I also struggle to live up to society's ideals of what it means to be a woman and I think this is, unfortunately, part of what it means to be a woman in our current society. When I do my hair and put on makeup and look in the mirror, I see an impostor in my skin looking back at me.  There are all kinds of women and none of us deserve to be marginalized because we aren't the ideal feminine beauty.  So if you are a woman and want to wear makeup and surround yourself with pretty things, then do it.  If you are a woman and you want to wear combat boots and get dirty, then do it.  If you are a woman that wants to wear makeup and combat boots, do it!  We are women in our hearts and brains and our external appearances can't change that.  All I can say is I hope you can find the strength to live your authentic self, whatever that may be, not only is life short, but we only get the one so it make it great.  I also hope you can find some comfort in knowing that you are getting more and more people everyday who are willing to step up and support you, I being one of them.

"I think that this debate, while being all the more deadly serious to the effect of transness, is central to 'successful womanhood' in and of itself. As a first-generation college student, and a cis woman of color from a low socio-economic background, I've found that 'performing' my gender in a way that conforms to the reigning ideals of white femininity has been essential in my bids for success in the academic and professional worlds that are slanted against me. There is a need to be ultra-polished and ultra-hardworking to earn respect at the same level as others.    When I first accepted a scholarship to a prestigious university, I was an intelligent, yet socially awkward girl with hand-me-down clothes who hated makeup. As a senior, I rarely feel comfortable stepping out without a full face, styled hair, and a coordinated outfit. I hear myself talk sometimes about studying abroad, networking, internships that I've done... And when I'm at home with my family, I feel the disconnect; I almost don't recognize who I've become.   So, at the core of my experience w femininity, there is this struggle between my authentic self and wanting to subvert the oppressive culture that I belong to, and the necessity to conform in order to be accepted and thrive.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The bit around 9:30-9:50 is something I as a cis woman have witnessed but have never been able to put a finger on. It's so awkward for me as someone who considers themselves a feminist and a trans ally. so much of it seems almost overdone and I know it's not my place to say anything... I figured the flamboyance was from years of pent up femininity, so I was always like, work it girl!! but so many trans women or femme gay men seem to feel this need to be on point 24.7. I now realize it's not 'on point', it's probably them getting caught up in the male ideals of femininity that cis women have had our whole lives to come to terms with. They get caught up in it bc that's the dominating definition.... males have always defined what it means to be a woman. It means a lot to me to hear your explanation, and gives me more sympathy to know that the perfectionism and even competitiveness I see in them is a response to the same systematic oppression I deal with myself. I've given up on masculine ideals of perfection and I'm settling for the ideal of being comfortable with and confident in myself, but it's taken me 26 years to come to this point. In the past there's been a lot of times I've had my appearance made fun of my trans women or femme gay men, usually about how my clothes fit wrong or I didn't wear enough makeup. i can't prescribe a cause to every case but I fully in my heart understand the drive to appeal to a masculine ideal of femininity. I can understand now that it wasn't entirely about me, in every instance, even though some of my jeans were actually too short for me lol. I know there's so much more to their predicament than what I stated here. But I'm so grateful for what you said!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Oooh hears a scary question. If we take away gender norms of asthetic and we are only left with chromosomes xx and xy does the question of equality between the sexes have a positive or negitive answer? Is it even possible in our species? Maybe gender equality isnt a question of enlightenment ( intelligence honor or personal integrity) in regards to our society, but instead is an instinctual question of (natural dominance strength and aggressive expression). Do we as humans on an instinctual level not treat the sexes equally not because women are less intelligent or lack personal agency but instead because they are naturaly physicaly weaker creatures as compared to the male counterpart? Sexual dimorphysum in reverse and all that. Can women and men truly believe one another to be absolute equals if instinct demands that at our most raw animal core we each know among the two which would be the loser or victor in a battle between beasts? Humans are animals after all. We may like to be high philosophical thinkers every now and then but that one fact is unchangeable.  **Scientist today taking scans of peoples brains will say that humans both male and female will process the image of a man as a 'person' while viewing a woman they see an 'object'.    Strange.  **In our spoken and written languages the way to emasculate the the masculine is to feminise and yet there is no commonly known word for the reverse of this in the feminine context. We simply go from male then down to female then down to what....objectification. In a stystem of regression we go from one type of person to another type of person but anything below this isnt even human anymore so what in fact is the humanty of woman.Oooooo.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Well....i didnt know trans women and cis feminist had beef. Damn. I love this show i learn new stuff every day. So let me try and understand this. Gender is 'asthetic'...Its nothing more than common behavioral patterns assigned to one sex or the other without directly impacting the reproductive traits of one individual to the next. So its like the boys are blue girls are pink argument?  Your gender is just the behaviors and actions that form habits that become norms expected to be played out in a given role? So sex is your repoductive capability in regards to nature itself while gender is just a socialy agreed apon (temperment) associated with one specific sex vs another?Hmm if thats the case then is the real problem Femenists are facing in the fight for equality in a masoginistic human society. Not one over the (value) of an xy chromosome compared to an xx chromosomes but instead one of ( actively changing deeply ingrained ideals of gender esthetics) that directly corollate with the negitive stigma attached to simply having a uterus.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The aesthetic... I'm not trans, but I am bi and was in denial for a long time. I was essentially my own bully. I came out at around 22 and always regretted not coming out sooner. But attending Catholic school, and being in society in general, and having friends that just would casually use gay slurs, constant jokes on tv. I never felt even close to comfortable acknowledging that side of myself. To do so would be a social death sentence, and I was already socially destitute. Even to this day I have trust issues with close friends. I feel like I never know their true intentions no matter how clear they make them. Plenty of straight people will use the word f***** as a bludgeon if they feel even remotely challenged on any of their preconceived notions. This constant need to be on guard, to act and present a certain way with my emotions and always pay attention to how others perceive me... it's exhausting. It must be way harder for a trans person. Like, speaking of gay boys on instagram, I wish I had been one. There's a huge part of me that felt I never had the chance to totally own who I was. It was robbed from me by a cruel and indifferent society. Coming out earlier would have been like trial by fire. Kind of a lose-lose scenario. But more power to those who can do it. It sucks having to wait, whether you're gay or trans or anything.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Oooooh this bougie trans lady.... She is essentially arguing that performing womanhood, as it is defined in this culture and in this time period, is critical to social acceptance for trans people. But this notion reinforces the completely arbitrary definition of womanhood is now. She's just reinforcing a perception of womanhood that is isolating and exclusionary, which is why she feels the need to 'pass' in the first place!!! What is means to be a 'man' or 'woman' has changed over time and is different currently around the world. Limiting the entire experience of womanhood to the ugliest cis male's fantasy of a being a blow up doll is pretty disappointing... but maybe I'm misunderstanding.     In Being and Nothingness, Sartre gives an example of a waiter who is living in bad faith, i.e. living in self-deceit. 'For Sartre, he waiter's exaggerated behaviour is evidence that he is play-acting at being a waiter, an automaton whose essence is to be a waiter. However, in order to play-act at being a waiter, the waiter must at some level be aware that he is not in fact a waiter, but a conscious human being who is deceiving himself that he is a waiter.' The appearance of a thing does not define it. Claiming that any woman, what every their identity, has to buy into a man's fantasy of womanhood/femininity is crazy.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Here is my opinion.   The issue I have with this video is the idea that appearing as a woman makes you a woman. I agree that the age of aesthetics is upon us, but I also think reason is also still upon us and that these are two sides of humans that are always relevant.   I look at it like 'easy truth' vs 'hard truth.' It's more difficult to go through the internal processes required to achieve real self confidence for anyone. At the same time, it's hard to see the truth of who other people are. Being recognizable as a woman by others allows this truth to be seen by others very easily, but the self confidence still won't be there for a lot of people.  Fake it til u make it works for some. Others benefit from reasoning. Imo","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"So... you're basically saying that what you are must always be based on other's perception of you? I mean, I'm not naive enough to say that this notion is not partially correct, but to consciously act that way is a bit... pointlessly straining. We live in the age of the internet! At least one group of people out there won't care, doesn't understand, or doesn't know who you are, no matter if you have thirteen copies of an official medical degree stamped to your chest. Even if who you 'really' are is a fantasy, if you try to fashion yourself into the belonging kind of the entire internet or even a single village, it is always *you* that will be sacrificed. Doesn't that undermine the whole point of trying to gender yourself in the first place? The whole point being that you want people to treat you how you really feel? The comfort in finding people who accept and understand you? And if you really don't want to convince the world who you are, shouldn't you just find a small group of friends or family that can relate to you and support you? That seems much more effective for your emotional health.  A counterargument could be made against the very notion of this performance itself. But that's just my opinion... It hardly matters in broad overarching societal norms... But maybe fighting those norms from the ground up is how we get society to change.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The older i get the worse this gets for me, like do i identify as female because i look like what society has told ime s a female. Is it because I was raised to be a 'girl'. I've been called a tom boy and told 'You're not like a girl girl, you're more like a guy girl.' I've never really considered my gender for most of my life, I just was what I was. But, If someone asked me to defend being female, I'm not so sure I could in any meaningful way. I'm pretty sure I'm a cis woman, but i sometimes feel like I have to defend my gender to myself. Like I'll look at my hands and they look super masculine to me, so I get this overwhelming urge to paint my nails and wear rings so they look more feminine, so I look more feminine. When I look in the mirror and see even a hint of facial hair, I freak out. I have this fear that I'm not enough of a girl and someday everyone is going to realize I'm a fraud. And if I feel this way, as someone who society generally accepts as being female I can't even imagine what it's like for someone who is trans, intersex, or nonbinary.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i actually know an entire group of cis men who dress as women, do their hair like women, take hormones (not blockers though) and everything a pre op/non op trans woman would do, they refer to themselves as traps, i spoke of this before btw, one big thing to note is some are not even into guys at all, aka straight, though rare, it's why i stand by my belief that you are trans by identity and a trap by appearance (till a word comes along that doesn't indicate the intent to trap people into thinking they are a girl, because typically that is not the intent, as with a trans girl) this also allows one to be trans but only do the appearance part time, but they can also choose to do it full time if they wish, there are, though not common, traps who always trap, ones who live alone or in more free living homes tend to be this type because it's easier than to change back and forth, all full traps have a feminine body all the time, that doesn't go away, and the ones who use hormones have real breasts too, there is no difference between a trans girl and a cis trap other then identity* and there is typically no appearance difference between a good trap and a cis woman, saying a good trans is just rude so i won't say that, but you know it applies also, by definition, all trans girls are either a trap or not, and all traps are either cis or trans, now saying that trans encompases being a trap also is ok, so long as you don't make it mandatory, aka a trans girl can look or not look like a girl, but one who does doesn't need to denote the difference, some can look at it in stages, and some do, starting at identity, or even starting from cis, and then moving to full non biological girl, with steps being :guy*-crossdresser-trap-girl*, *of course guy and girl on this list only mean apparence and not identity, i know that i leave large comments but i feel that leaving things up to assumption/imagination and guesswork when talking about something this controversial is just a bad idea","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"About the point that trans women are only women if they are perceived as such: i think it heavily depends on the perspective.

Everybody has their own reality, but the most important is really your own. Because society at large doesnt even have one opinion. One person might think im cool, another might not. How does any of that make me more or less cool? It doesnt robb me of my coolness because true identity comes from within.

"I notice that in all these videos Tabby, while often over the top and unpalatable, offers the arguments and perspective that speaks to me the most.  As a cis male I have always liked the weird and violent girls in Doc Martins.  There are many flavors of woman.  All of them are viable although many people will call some of them more fem than others.  One of my kids came out as trans a few years back and they often have issues explaining to me what it is that they feel.  My current position is that first of all not everyone's experience is the same as yours so I cannot just apply my experience to other peoples problems and come out with a correct answer.  Second, it just may not be for me to understand, but to accept.  I love and accept my child even though I currently, and maybe never will, understand.  Thank you for your videos.  Although I do not think your experiences apply directly to the situation that I or my child find ourselves in, the perspective has certainly been enlightening.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Thank you Natalie for another brilliant video!  Justine's arguements speak to an anxiety that I've been aware of for years as a cis woman- how 'feminine' do we have to be to be respected  or valued in this society?  Or how much femininity is it essential to perform to avoid being (at best) invisible or (at worst) harassed and mocked?  In college I was really angry at drag queens, because I thought that they were simultaneously insulting women and setting an incredibly high bar- I.e. to be considered a 'real woman' now you need implants, fake lashes, extensions, long nails, and all the makeup tricks and strutting that drag queens excel at.  Although I'm a decadent degenerate at heart, it was affirming to loudly turn my back on all of that and be a Tabby, giving a giant finger to gender expectations and respectability politics.  It's a treacherous, complicated swamp of image and politics, and I'm glad that you are here making videos to help us all navigate it with more awareness!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Ive had a lot of conflict with this video.  It appears to me to insist the idea of performance is an absolute essential to a transgender person being their gender.  It says the identification of a gender role is depended upon how others perceive you and that it can be revoked by the social gatekeepers at large if you do not perform it well.  But there is a thing about that.  For if you perform the gender role perfectly, that does not mean that it cannot still be revoked by the mainstream society the moment they see what body parts you have.  This would lead then to the idea that in order to truly perform the role, all trans people should aspire to corrective surgery.  And even then, many of the social gatekeepers still will revoke a surgically transitioned trans persons identity anyways because as they say all the time, gender is what you were assigned at birth.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Philosophical divergences aside, and assuming the end justifies the mean, seems like Tabbies and Justines simply have to keep fighting their battles in their own fashion, on their peculiar fronts. As far as I can tell, history rewards (as well as punishes) at times revolutionaries, at times diplomats. Is it ever possible to accurately predict which strategy will be the most effective in any given context? Does everything have to boil down to this dichotomy, or is there/could there be a third way, a fourth, a fifth... More importantly, a way that's able to somewhat reconcile the Tabby and the Justine in our own heads, or at least to combine their methods for maximum impact?

"If cis women are allowed to not confine to femininity, then it should extend to trans women. One's perception doesn't always mean a privilege or oppression (though I understand that, sometimes it can). My butch cis girlfriend sometimes gets misgendered as a man but that doesn't she has male privilege, just as a trans woman getting misgendered as a man doesn't equate male privilege. It's just the narrow definition of what a Women means.  Women, trans or cis, cannot escape being women systematically/ experiencing misogyny (even if just internally).  But also, the misgendering of trans women doesn't always literally mean they're viewed as a cis man. Cis men are not called a man/he as an insult, and are not treated w violence for being a man (obviously men can face violence for other things like race, disabilities, class, etc.) But trans women getting misgendered is not receiving male privilege, because most of the time the spectator knows they're not a cis man, even if they call them such.  But main point is trans women are still treated as women even if not viewed as True Women by transphobes. Butch women (whether cis or trans) aren't really viewed as True Women because as well as being cis and non-intersex, Womanhood is seen as being feminine, and, most importantly attracted to men (exclusively). Lesbians (femme, butch, nb, trans, cis, ANY) are viewed as Outside of Womanhood, yet, still face misogyny and are systematically women. This is especially why many wlw have a disconnection to womanhood and identify as woman-aligned or femme/butch/lesbian IS their gender, and possibly why many women if exclusively attracted to men maybe realize they're trans women before wlw trans women do. Because you tell someone you're a woman and maybe they'll believe you, but tell them you're a lesbian butch woman and well, how could you be a True Woman, then?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"you know, i just found this channel a couple weeks ago. I didn't know why i kept watching at first, but i feel like i see something in her videos:  a conflict inside herself. Like maybe she's still debating a lot of these things herself. Like her characters are pieces of her inside her heard positing forward these views, and arguing against one another until she comes to a conclusion that she embraces herself.  this is the first vid where i feel compelled to actually say something because this topic strikes true for me. I identify as male, but there are many times when i question whether the things i do and the way i appear are masculine enough. Despite being 'cisgender' there are times when i strongly question if i am 'playing' the role of man enough. Is my inner experience what makes me a man? Is it my genitals? is my masculinity durable enough for me to wear things i like even though they are 'cute' and thus 'non-manly'? These are questions i've come up with verbal answers to and been reassured by others of, but the internal debate and doubts still linger.  This video feels to me like an expression of anguish over such internalized questioning of gender identity vs gender expression. Like part of her feels a NEED to be glam and present strongly as typically feminine while part of her wants to outright reject that as it's harmful and bad. She recognizes the fact that it's bad, but like Justine points out, they may not say it, but they think it, and someone can revoke you easily or so her anxiety tells her.  Natalie, i want to thank you for the time you take in making these videos and if i'm simply projecting own doubts and questioning on you please let me know.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"After watching this I went back and watched Contra's 'How I became a Feminist SJW', and I have to say... I really still don't believe Contra is a true feminist if s/he believes that woman are 'nothing but full-time drag queens'.   I think that's really naive, because womanhood isn't just a way of walking or wearing clothes/makeup. 'Performing Womanhood' rarely has anything to do with those things. (I mean, just the act of reducing womanhood to wearing high-heels and swaying your hips is sexist, isn't it?)  The problem with trans women, drag queens, etc. Is that they reduce and romanticize womanhood as being some sort of real-life movie starlet; while rarely recognizing that most of what a woman does happens behind the scenes. I think most women know what I'm talking about; and know that (as narcissistic as some women are) that being a woman is rarely glamorous; and has very little to do with hair, makeup, clothing; or even how you internally 'identify;' (for example: I'm a natural biological woman, and although I'm very feminine, I've never once simply identified 'as a woman' but as an artist, a writer, daughter, girlfriend, etc.) or how masculine or feminine you may seem to other people... But the subconscious thought processes behind the 'performance' that nobody ever sees; whether or not our day-to-day lives are as glamorous as a drag-queen's dress rehearsal.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I love this video, like most of yours. ^^   The part about the cis man pretending to be a woman, and embodying the role entirely and consistently, made me think about the philosophical zombie experiment, and the problem surrounding the validation of self-awareness.   However, regarding the debate around gender identity, simply verbally communicating your subjective experience can be potentially valid. It's still a matter of outward expression and not simply personal experience once communicated.   Though, I don't see why someone would want to identify as a woman while not looking at all like one. And simply stating one's gender identity without being in the process of embodying it seems futile. Apart from medical reasons, why would a gender label be useful for someone that does not embody it at all...? I mean even the exemples of cis women with some secondary male characteristics would be considered female since they typically embody enough femininity to be labeled as such, which has nothing to do with attractiveness... or maybe I just have wishful thinking. :/   That being said, femininity is a spectrum (with many variables like appearance, demeanour, way of thinking, hormone levels - to some extent - etc.), and the label 'woman' refers to an arbitrary cut-off point.   For the record, Tabby is very cute and quite feminine in my opinion. But, I do understand (don't experience it though, as I'm not trans) the struggle of needing to overcompensate to be able to pass... Tabby doesn't need to though. ;) Still, the state of affairs is depressing in this respect... Maudite societe du spectacle...   Finally, to come back to aesthetics, 'seemings' (illusions; tricks of the light, just to reference the colour analogy) are indeed the only things that matter, that are accessible, philosophically speaking.  Ok, it's time to end this monologue... it's still an ongoing discussion in my head anyway... ;)   Love!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is so eye opening. I will admit that up until finding your channel, I definitely had transphobic tendencies in thought and in attitude toward trans issues. I remember a few years ago I was talking with my friend about a person from our school who was in the process of transitioning from male to female and I said very cruel things that in my perspective were completely logical but looking back I now realize were very inconsiderate of that persons perspective. And while having these opinions on said mtf trans person, I had a completely different attitude toward another trans person who was ftm and had already completed his biological transition and had reintegrated into society. I was generally more accepting of the latter and thus considered myself 'on their side' even though I still held onto bigoted attitudes. Seeing this, I realize that my attitudes towards trans people were based solely off of my own definition of gender and what I believed a woman or man aesthetic looks like.   I regret these behaviors and I'm really glad that I've been able to get some perspective. Now, I *want* to understand. Not dismissively or passively just because it's the politically correct thing to do, but because I want to be a convert.   Thanks contra!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Okay but consider this: what about non-binary people who aren't yet really recognized by society yet? For example, I can present androgynous and behave in a way that is a combination of female and male social roles. By your argument, I'm performing my aesthetic well. But people still try to put me in one of the binary categories. In this situation, aesthetics is not enough and social awareness probably does need to come from rationality and maybe even a little confrontation.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Btw I generally am looking for feedback and posted here because I really like contrapoint because of how well crafted and thought out her content is. I am right leaning/conservative but am very anti religious. Btw if you have a good counter to this it could be quite effective on the moderate right.  Change my mind/edit my thoughts: a person undergoing transformations in life naturally or artifically never under any condition ends personhood. However it must be declared that the process called gender reassignment is not a cure to any natural affliction that would require a functional sex change of male to female or vis a vis. It's greatest and possibly only affect is disillusionment (looking for a better word) of others natural reproductive functions that identify desirable physical traits in others. It is unable to gentically alter people only their bodily dimmensions so can only be considered a gradient step. But still a possible sollution for someone who simply feels a deep need to appear and be socially treated differently on the grounds of sex. Half steps or incomplete steps must be legally or medically treated as such and therefore in medical and legal spheres the  biological definition of a male having a Y chromosome and a female not having a Y chromosome must be observed for practicality and safety. It must be noted that the deep seated ramifications of the condition known as body dismorphia must be better understood so that a proper and humane regimen of care can be developed for these individuals. Wether it leads to a full transformation enabling a fulfillment of such desires or a removal of the negative effects of the condition. Care and compassion to our fellow humans must always be observed even in these cases. And with the common multi-condition nature of people with unstable identities and like disorders better understanding of not just the condition but the people and groups afflicted is our only path forward to achieving better treatment.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Sometimes the first to tread a road must sacrifice to pave the way. It is bullshit that trans women have to be dolled up 24/7 to be seen as women (until feminization is complete). But if the trans women who have to do that are able to push the boundaries and establish all trans women as women, then future trans women won't be subjected to that. Suffragettes were seen as harpies, just so we (women) could vote without discrimination.   It isn't fair, but it does work. How long it takes is subject to society's attitudes. I hope that this stupid debate is over soon. It's easy for people who have never experienced a second of gender dysphoria to act as if it's not a big deal or that it doesn't exist.   Not everyone gets that luxury. If someone is standing in front of you, telling you that being born with the wrong physical gender is what they've experienced, who tf are you to tell them that they're wrong?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Aesthetics. Art. Violence. The roles we play... The truth of the matter is that this society which is derived from Abrahamic structures locked roles and traits to genders and due to the thoughts of the time, sexes. Privilege and power set the rules and rules act to control. The choice of leash or lash need not exist because tradition is self enforcing with minor additions or corrections as subversions emerge to disrupt. Any time one steps out of the assigned role or displays an abnormal trait, the society attempts to correct the deviation from normal; normal is of course defined by the society... This occurs first as gentle social pressures and then escalates. Violence is the result because violence against the society was conducted. Art is violent but each of us practices an artform. We practice Aesthetic. We can continue our role upon the stage or change it at our own choosing though even that choosing can Mechanistically be defined as already going to happen because the choice was made before the choice came to exist which then states the truth that we have. We are conducting a performance. And that performance is the life we live. This is not a comforting thought. It either is or is not the way everything works and so at the end of everything it stops mattering. We will perform the acts that will be performed and endure consequences from ourselves, from our societies... Play the Game or don't, but every action taken impacts every other person who wears the same symbols and is part of the represented societies.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"While yes, it's hard to agree with Justine, I think the point was that optics and aesthetics are important when it comes to power only. It is sad that it's somewhat necessary to conform to the general opinions of what a woman should look like and act like to have the power that comes with the identity of womanhood (not that there is a lot of power in our hands to begin with, but hey), but that is the general idea behind Butler's performance of the gender, imo. You act the role, you get the benefits of the role. While it may not be important or necessary for our inner selves to look like the societies idea of a woman, it is when dealing with the general public, it gives you more legitimacy and validity in their eyes. Why are most of the politician populists? Why do political options that are more radical never amount a big following?  But I think there is hope for us 'weirdos'. Because, things are changing, the process of normalization is marching on, we have come a long way in widening the definition of a woman. The general public 'accepts' more variables now and it 'grants' them more power.  The society is accepting more and more LGBTIQ people in the public sphere as a normal occurrence, but beware, this process goes both ways unfortunately, it has also been normalizing alt-right ideas and fascism. The first does no harm (except to some outdated norms), while the second is a threat to society's literal safety.  P.S.

"Honestly, I prefer the poetry of Sappho over that of teenage gay boys on Instagram. But that's mainly because I haven't been on Instagram in more years than the months this video has been up.  As to actual philosophical discourse on aesthetics...it's a balance. You point out color-matching style theory with the exact same color wheel I have similarly hanging on my wall. And that's significant in representing the idea of conformity to others' views, as failing to mix tones and tints properly yields garish content even within the context of different cultural or countercultural identities. (For a younger audience, I recommend googling for a glimpse into 90's 'fashion'. So many splotches of random vibrant colors everywhere! It was like a unicorn got so drunk that it started vomiting rainbows...that was an awesome time to be a kid!)  However, there's the explicit element of personal identification. People buy what they like, and obviously are going to wear what they buy so they literally ought to be wearing what they like. Plus some rationalizing to invert the sentiment such that 'people ought to like what they wear' becomes a second conclusion, but I'm a philosopher so I don't need to go through all the steps to get to the conclusion if people agree with it. (Nah, I'm just kidding. This second conclusion is instead actually reached from the starting point of acknowledging individual taste and personal preferences as valid acceptable precepts or a foundation taken 'a priori' without contention.)  -----  A person who wishes to earn respect (or other forms of social power) must be willing to balance what they want to (in this case) wear with what other people believe about (in this case) the outfit as a whole and in composition. So I can speak pretty bluntly that you won't see me in vibrant 'Hawaiian shirts', and that I will very rarely wear a suit because I don't actually like suits. I can also say confidently that if I wear a suit, unless it's for something like a funeral for someone I cared about, it's probably gonna be a bright or flamboyant combination.  And, taking from music, there's nothing wrong with being 'underground' or 'alternative'. They may not have an excessive hold on mainstream presence, but they can fill a gap or niche that the 'normal' conventions don't necessarily provide. However, the corollary to this is that such 'alternative' status permits less leniency in terms of what is socially allowed to be gotten away with. Ozzy Osbourne can do a lot more 'wrong' than Rob Zombie before people start criticizing the former; as an example.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"19:23 Jesus Christ... So, I moderate a ContraPoints facebook group and someone posted a shot from a few seconds before this with the Simpsons meme 'watch this, Lise, you can actually see the moment where her heart rips in half'.

"As a non-transitioning trans man... I have no insecurity about my gender, so it seems like a waste of time, energy, and resources to do expensive things to my body to make other people perceive me more accurately. (Granted that I did pass flawlessly for male as a teenager, so I do have a formative lived experience of social masculinity bolstering my internal self-knowledge.) My brain is something that physically exists in nature and my consciousness is a thing that's happening regardless of whether others understand a single thing about it. No one is ever able to experience another person's consciousness anyway. We are all alone. So someone else understanding what I am, or misunderstanding what I am, is a separate event from my own existence.   I agree w/ Natalie that since I only communicate my masculinity verbally and in my mannerisms/behavior, no one fully, consistently perceives me as a man while interacting with me, and so my maleness it will never be truly manifested in the space between me and any other person I interact with unless I transition (which I am seriously considering right now, because it's difficult to date people when you're in a biological form of drag 24/7). But why is the space between me and another person more 'real' than the space in my own head? Both these spaces are metaphysical, not really real; they're just events that happen. It's contradictory to state that my gender is defined by others' perceptions, not my internal experience, on the grounds that internal experience is only metaphysical - because perception is only metaphysical as well.   In her next video Natalie states that she recognizes people like me as trans, but is largely dissuaded from recognizing me as male because psychological gender experience is a bad argument for trans rights. I would say to her what I would say to anyone - okay, if you don't see my masculinity, you don't have to recognize it. You'll just be wrong about one more little, inconsequential detail in the world, and that's fine.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This video hit me really hard, for some reason.   I only started watching your videos earlier today, beginning with the Incel one.  Until you said it at the 15 minute mark in that Video, I had no idea you were trans.  This vid teaches me why. You carry yourself like a woman, do extra work to look like what a woman looks like in one's head, move with grace etc.  And while the reason I got invested into your content was that it was well-written, well researched and pretty damn funny, what kept me watching through the first (few)minute(s), was the presentation.  Not just the great camerawork, lighting, and editing, but just the fact that there was a beautiful, eloquent woman narrating, performing all these neat gestures and speaking in a soothing voice.  I hope that didn't come off as too creepy.   Had Tabby narrated that video, or a woman with a cranky voice, or someone I would immediately guess was trans, would I have been captivated in the same way?   I consider myself tolerant and generally open-minded, but you made me question where 'political correctness' can, will or should stop, and when you can or should stop fighting your instincts because it's futile.   The range of problems you introduce goes far beyond my own small 'moment of clarity', and I understand that it's not the focus of this video.  But I hope you can still accept my thanks for such a well thought-out project. Here's to binging your channel tonight.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I don't think she was even trying to make a case for NB identities, just binary trans people. I think a lot of people are trying to claim that Nat's view is Justine's, but I don't believe that's true at all.

Calls to mind what Contrapoints said in a different vid about 'diaphanous gestures of womanhood' and 'seeming like a woman'. Tabby trips my switch and reads completely as 'woman', to the point where I literally don't see anything mannish about her, possibly because she calls to mind one of my first schemas of 'woman' Obviously this is entirely besides the point of the entire video, except for maybe as a small aside that while Justine is right about society's idea of 'womanhood', the individual's idea of woman can vary widely.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I've never thought of myself as a terf- but I was raised in a feminist household where I was taught gender is a social construct. So at times when I saw trans women promoting a very femme image, through dresses, expensive makeup and surgery, it made me worry- are people confusing gender roles with being women, and encouraging gender stereotyping in the process?

"I see that it resonated with a lot of people but the whole 'forum versus circus' thing is just....not true.  Think about how the Greeks did philosophy.  A lot of it was written as dialogues for a reason, and there were several different schools whose main way of doing their philosophy was to walk around in public and create a scene.  Likewise, Rome had it's great philosophers, and in fact, a good chunk of our knowledge about Greek philosophy comes from Roman commentary on it.    This might seem like a minor point, but I think it's dangerous to pretend that there's some historical oscillation between these two 'poles,' especially given the content of the rest of the video.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Entertaining and thought-provoking as always.  My identity conflict doesn't have to do with Gender and the judge isn't society as a whole but I feel myself in Tabby's boots here.    I'm a technologist (no bachelors degree), with skills and passion for design, wanting to be seen as an engineer.  I didn't stop reading and learning after technical school but I didn't make it through University.  I don't really dress and act like a nerd... cough... engineer either.  I'm an angry and sarcastic fat midget with long hair and untidy beard wearing his band shirts and swearing at the office.  When managers discuss who should get a promotion, my aesthetic, though I get to be 'myself' in that regard, doesn't skew opinions in my favor. I'm not likely to get that role I identify with the most.  It might help my case if I didn't scare people away.  However, the dishonesty hurts.  It especially hurts if people deny me the identity I try to portray ('He can't solve 'big' problems.  He's not 'really' an engineer.').

"So I just had a revelation about this video.  This video triggered me pretty badly when I first watched (listened) to it, but I was confused about what was bothering me so much. I thought it had to do with the dismissal of nonconforming women, because of the subject matter; but frankly, I'm used to that shit by now and I don't normally feel like I have any trauma attached to it.  Today, it hit me. It wasn't the subject of The Aesthetic that bothered me. It was the depiction of the relationship between the two women, which reminds me in many respects of an abusive friendship that dominated my childhood.  The conversation consists largely of Justine bullying Tabby, *ostensibly for her own good*. The normally forthright, self-willed Tabby is reduced to nearly silence, apparently cowed by Justine. Justine belittles her, insults her, and dismisses her priorities, values, and choices about her own body with a wave of her hand, substituting her own; and Tabby argues a little, but ultimately defers. It's for her own good, after all. Justine is just telling the *hard truths*.   The 'truths' in question? That everyone thinks she's weird. That she makes everyone uncomfortable. That no one will accept her the way she is. That Justine is the only person *willing* to be her friend. That Justine is doing her a favor by belittling her and breaking her down. That all of her bullying is just because she's trying to mold her into a person that other people will be able to tolerate or take seriously. That Tabby has to conform to Justine's ideas of how to live her life if she ever wants to be friends with anyone else.  There's no intimacy between these two characters. No indication that Justine actually cares about Tabby qua Tabby. No indication that Tabby feels anything but uncomfortable. Sure, Justine may claim to love her. But she's claiming that at the end of a video consisting primarily of tearing her down 'for her own good.' It's classic gaslighting.  Natalie said on Twitter that she intended this video as an examination of how trans women talk among themselves. She implied that she has her own Justine-equivalent, who taught her the importance of being glamorous to being taken seriously. I really, really hope that the relationship portrayed on screen is nothing like any relationship that Natalie may have in real life; because I've been there, and it is not healthy.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"think Justine had the better argument, but Tabby had the moral high ground. Ultimately, the entire video is just a metaphor for the continued struggle between idealists (Tabby) and realists (Justine).  People talking about who win are missing the larger point though; there's not suppose to be a winner here. The true purpose of dialogue is to understand the other viewpoint, and it's always been my opinion that when you can truly do so, conceding some of your vision (right or wrong) to reach a higher quorum of opinion, you make a stronger movement. Mainstream feminists (and liberals) have as much to learn from radical feminists (and socialists) as they do them. I'm not arguing for a completely centerist view, but one which is more center than the current popular bipolar dichotomy.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I stumbled on your channel,  as YouTube was auto-playing in the background. I am a plain vanilla conservative, who finds the trans debate a puerile distraction applicable to 0.001% of the population at best.Yet i must admit this is the first time i can think of where witty dialog over a subject i have no interest in kept me fully riveted and entertained. I subbed and listened to some of your others. You have a great talent for dialogue.  It is genuinely funny, and you seem to have a knack for tackling radical or toxic topics critically without being inflammatory. It feels like a post structural critique of post structuralism. Given your fluency in post-modern terminology and authors, i am forced to admit you have a genuine education in the area, but your take on it reminds me of a current day Sokal-like sendup. I also listened to your piece on attempting to be a writer and realizing that just being able to appreciate great lit does not necessarily lend itself to writing it (a reality i had to face myself) . So I felt compelled to leave a comment and tell you that your talent may simply be a product of the modern day, and rather than wasting your time on the written word and it's associated diminishing audience, you should continue doing this. I do not doubt you will find growing success here.  I'd love to see you debate some of the conservative YouTube folks like Crowder, Shapiro or even D'Souza.....and of course Milo.

Tabby definitely seems a bit extreme in that she wants to cause violence, but she's too idealistic in how the world actually works. In my opinion, life should run the way Tabby talks about here, but unfortunately turns out how Justine talks about.  Also, I should have paid more attention to the transphobia warning at the start.

"Can someone help me? I still didn't understand what makes you a man or a woman. Seriously. I'm convinced that just looking to the chromosomes is stupid but... everything is a social construct? I don't think so... but then what is not the social construct?  If a trans woman believes that the womanhood is entirely a social construct, what is her inner impulse to be/feel a woman? What makes you to know it? In case of a trans woman that is a lesbian and believes that gender as the traditional social construct should be ignored: why does not feel satisfactory to be a 'man' with feminine traits?   I don't want to be disrespectful (hopefully). Actually, even if I don't understand trans identity (yet), I have a deep respect for them, as it must be difficult as fuck, and requires courage and resiliance that maybe I don't have.  I do respect their choices and I admire people like Natalie, who raises the bar, not for trans women, but for humanity in general.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I honestly think Jung's ideas about archetypes and 'primordial images' may be the direction for the gender debate to go through. I don't necessarily mean his theory of anima/animus. You're dealing with categories--man/woman--that exist yet have no strict qualities or criteria. Archetypes are based on millions of years of evolutionary experience and don't conform to any specific cultural norm. 'Woman' is a concept not based on a list of criteria, but millions of years of observation and practice of tangible living examples. Thus, like all archetypes, 'you know it when you see it.' As in, you FEEL it. It's primal instinct.   If we allow gender to be a primordial image (for which there is no attack helicopter category), we avoid basing it on current gender roles, stereotypes, or ideals, even though those things may overlap. We also give it an evolutionary foundation. What's interesting about this is that archetypes are a collective image, which mirrors Justine's point about gender being a social construct, but still does not validate the notion that it has to be performed or earned in any specific way. But, at the same time, there exist certain qualities that cue our instinct to distinguish between male and female, but they are too complex to put into words (which leads to stereotyping).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It's not ok to smash anyone unless you are defending against real physical attack, because to protect the freedom of expression of those you favor you must also defend the freedom of your political enemies... I could go on and on... it's too ridiculous.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've watched all of Contrapoints videos and I've liked them all so far, but this one . . . I felt so hollow inside by the end. I can tell this is not a video directed toward non-binary people. Non-binary people can never 'pass' as anything because we are literally outside the 2 accepted genders (male/female). So basically, there *is* no place for someone like me in  this world. Like my mom said when I came out to her, 'You HAVE TO be a boy or a girl! Society won't accept an IT!' So . . . I am who I am, but have no place to go; no place in human society where I'd be considered real and valid -- even though I'm here and I exist and I can't be someone I'm not (and live). It's a very scary and alienating feeling.  I'm also asexual, and a lot of people don't seem to think asexual people exist either. So, for me, basically every day feels like an existential crisis. Like, 'I don't really exist, but I do, but not to others/society.' And back and forth, back and forth. It never ends.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This post is originally a response to Maria the Witch's video in response to this one, but I believe this deserves to be here, too. Maybe Natalie will read it, and let me know how much of my interpretation is wrong.     To Maria: I think you have missed the point Natalie is attempting to make. And I will refer to only the dialectic rather than the mock TV interview, as I feel that was only illustration and background to the dialectic. While I certainly can not speak for her, I am rather certain that she is aware of the problematic stance that Justine is taking. But she is also aware of the problematic stance of Tabby. Those of us (trans women) who have the privilege (as unfortunate as it is to have to call that privilege) to be seen, of which I am not one, represent us all. As an activist, Natalie is well seen, and knows that what she does reflects on all of us. The dialectic is between two of Natalie's inner monologues. Tabby, the radical idealist, doesn't care what anyone thinks, dresses and acts impulsively, however suits her. All of us admire that ideal, and know that is the way things should be. Justine, the pragmatic materialist, is chiding Tabby not for her own appearance, but for her public appearance that represents all of us. She at first extols the virtues of putting on a false face for the sake of everyone she represents, is rebuffed (correctly) by Tabby and admits she had gone to far, but continues to hold some belief in making some personal sacrifice for the sake of the cause. In the end, she reaches no conclusions, both sides unhappily accepting a difficult draw, and sits back to watch the angry YouTube comments and experience the state of the world unhappily. Her video provides no answers, I believe, because that was her point. Natalie has no answers, she doesn't know how to represent best a disparate community fighting for acceptance. What she does know is that both sides of her dialectic must make compromises. She knows that trans people can not, no matter how much we would like to, win acceptance on our own. No group ever has. You must kill the enemy softly. I hope I do her point justice, and I hope I am not to far off the mark.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Does gender make sex? No, that would be absurd. Sex produces gender. Reproductive divisions create a divergence in labour for the sexes, and these labours they may undertake have specific character to them. The spirit of the characters of these labours create the masculine and the feminine. So, no, gender is not a performance, it is the spirit of a performance: man have more strength, they fight more even in modern society, making up at least 95 percent of combat fatalities even with full inclusion, since women don't decide to fight, and that is okay, because women have much better literary capabilities than men because of how their brain works, and perhaps men go to war more because of other physical and physiological characteristics, say, that their brain actually perceives movement better than women, while women perceive colour better. This is thought to be because men hunted, and women picked plants. But why did this division occur in the first place? It occured because we are a social animal, and we are social animals because we are weak. A female human can't feed a child by herself while fending off a praire lion, gathering food, making clothes, and lighting fires. But a union between the two sexes benefits both their existence since Mankind can keep going because of their mutual labours. So, is gender a social construct? Maybe it was once, probably not, since we adopted things from our past creature selves, and apes are social. But at this point gender characteristics are physically and physiologically intrinsic and the performance has moulded us irreversibly. Behaviour comes from our complex chemical reactions and these reactions are the basis of all action, see deterministic scientific studies. So, if all performance is based on physical reality, and gender is based on sex, is not gender a part of the natural phenomenon?

I came upon your films by chance, quite uninterested in transsexual issues.

I don't claim to understand everything in your videos, but thanks to your wonderful person, wit, sense of aesthetics, I began watching these videos on these topics too, knowing on beforehand that I would love them, because I in a sense love you, and now I have an understanding that I did not have before. Not a deep one, but a base to start with. I love the ambigueity in many of your films - it mirrors my own in many topics, an un-ceasing self-questioning. I have heard that some people wouldn't want straight cis people to watch this, as they (that is, we, I) wouldn't understand it and get wrong ideas and just feed their (our, my) bigotry, but I think that such a restriction would be sorry, as evidently some of those bastards (at least I) are (am) gaining both understanding and sympathy out of this marvellous work.

"To understand this video it is necessary to understand that nat was coming from a place of self expression and aesthetics (the video is called The Aesthetics). She clearly shows both characters to be somewhat pathological, a part of a person which isnt concerned with arguments. It is pure anxiety. From the glamourous vocabulary she uses in the video, to the vague way she cites philosophers, it is clear this isnt to reach a conclusion.  Maybe the whole point was to see how many people resonated with justine, and therefore gave in to that anxiety and fear. Because this wasnt a good faith socratic debate, it was and endless internal war between anger and fear. This was a poem, not an essay. Maybe if you dogmatically resonate with justine, you should recognise that she wasnt trying to reach a conclusion, and was operating like the anxious part of a person would operate.  Even if you dont agree, nat is much clearer in other videos such as tiffany tumbles, incels, of violence, where she has a point, and explains it. Or just presents a theme and honestly deconstructs it.  So people, stop stressing out. A bit of art never hurt anyone","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think there needs to be a video expanding on how both Tabby and Justine are imperative to any social movement. I noticed that Blaire was only invited on Shapiro because that trans woman threatened him. Tabby gets trans women in the public eye by showing how angry trans women are, then people ask 'why is she acting like this?', that's when they invite the Justines of the world to have a stage and explain transgenderism in a way that's understandable to cis people. If all trans people were Tabby, then they'd be seen as dangerous and in need of help. If all trans people were Justine, then they'd go unnoticed and no social change would ever happen. I think i sympathise with Tabby more because she gets the ball rolling, but history will always favour Justines approach, in the same way that Martin Luther King is looked more favourably upon than Malcolm X. It's a messy topic, and I hope the critics understand that this video doesn't really endorse either side, even though 'aesthetically', it appears as though Justine won, but she literally conceded that neither approach on its own leads to any good outcomes.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Why is nobody talking about Abigails glowup? She got a complete makeover!   Well I'm guessing its a refrence to the whole theme of the video. She changed because she wants her opinions heard, Since if a person is more pretty and more calm, they present a better example of the movement they're apart of. Tabby is clearly a horrible example for her movement and this is what the video is about.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Not much in the habit of commenting on anything but as this video got a lot of hate I felt all shows of support, (even if they're small and a bit late), are probably important.   This video is the one that got me (an agender person who didn't feel remotely erased) properly into your channel. It's touching, difficult, entertaining, and BLATANTLY not endorsing all of Justine or Tabby's views - more importantly, its recognising the essential humanity and struggle of the characters.   I guess I can see why this video had some people scratching their heads - it's more 'arty,' and in some ways, more subtle and ambiguous than your other work. And sure, all art should be open to criticism. But some of the responses just reinforced the prevailing single-minded mentality that tends to dominate areas of the left.  After this I looked into your channel properly and doing so has been an enormous relief. When you already know you're seen as a complete lunatic to just about everybody else, the branding and rejection that can come as a result of questioning anything on your own side leaves you at risk of being totally alone. I think there are a lot of us who are quietly affected by that.  Your channel gives gives us room to breathe. So far, I've not really found anyone else similar. I hope more people take inspiration from your videos to help create a climate where discussion, subtleties and nuance can exist. It must be incredibly difficult. But it's important.

"Well, 'Justine' is absolutely right about one thing, die ewige Weiblichkeit, the archetype of the eternally feminine, is more real than real women. Just like you aren't a man yet just because you were born a male, you have to live up to it, not all females automatically understand what womanhood is all about. Latching on to any leftie-progressive-feminist cause (ultimately derived from anti-erotic puritanism), is therefore essentially self defeating if you're a transwoman, cause the final demiurgic aim of those causes is always the destruction of the feminine.  In the case of feminism, what it strives for is the dilution of femininity through constant admixture by the masculine, while relentlessly idealizing the masculine, seeking to appropriate it for women in order to turn them into men, yet at the same time posing to be against masculine power. The only way to understand this insane equation is to realize that feminism thinks femininity is unreal and worthless, while the only thing of real value and substance is either masculinity or perhaps gender neutrality (as in the image of their god, Yaldabaouth). Feminism is thus fundamentally anti-feminine, and while femininity is the only thing transwomen have to distinguish themselves from men (since they don't have the female biological function), transiness hooking up with this PC leftie HBTQ shit, as per some 90's confusion, isn't an alliance made in heaven. It's in fact, eventually completely untenable.  Where 'Justine' is wrong however, is where she says men define the feminine ideal. Nothing could be further from the truth. Men are perplexed and entranced by the feminine. They do not create it, and neither do, fundamentally, women themselves. That's because the feminine is not a 'social construct'. It's an eternal archetype, an idea, and archetypes rule the lives of human beings, not the other way around.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The idea of performativity is pure stupidity. It is intentionalism trying to grapple with the contingency of its operations in the face of scientific protocols that track deep, causal relationships. As such, it marks the collapse of the reality principle, which was only effective in certain cognitive ecologies given sufficient invariance. The gender issue is illustrative of this point as the old tools of social-coordinating language try to grapple with biological findings which simply can't be assimilated into meaningful speech. It's telling that both sides appeal to biology in order to rationalize their preferences. Plus, the idea of performance raises insoluble problems like 'authenticity'. (And habitual performance doesn't suffice to make it authentic. In fact, no criteria suffice to this end because authenticity can only ever be played out within in/out group dynamics.

The prince will always wear some version of a red/black/white outfit and the rose bride is assigned a red/white dress. Utena is allowed to play a role outside her gender, but only on the condition that the role is recognised in the story, that of a prince.

"Seems like there's been a lot of fallout from this video and, as a cis woman, I can't comment on how anyone else *'should'* react or feel. I accept that I can never understand and that I'm probably coming to this with the wrong mindset. I'm neither trans, nor am I a transphobe who comes to these channels for ammo, or someone who'll watch this one video and make a snap judgment about all trans people (aka the type some might be afraid will see this video). So yeah, take anything I say with a big honking grain of salt, 'cause this ain't my lane.  But I just wanna say, from my outsider perspective, it looks to me like this video represents just one piece of a larger, artistic puzzle. I think there's more to viewing this than just trying to figure out if Natalie agrees with Justine or Tabby.  Years ago, the video Natalie did about Milo talked about Aesthetics vs. Morals and declared the need for balance, because aesthetics without morals is BAD. There's also these two with Tiffany Tumbles, including one where Abigale attacks her on Freedom Report (just like she did with Tabby). And in the previous video, the one about Incels, there's a flash of Tiffany in front of her tutorial show backdrop while Natalie talks about not wanting to become 'a monster.'   There are more connections than that, but I feel like the ones I mentioned are more than just running gags. I think Natalie is hinting at a bigger theme, something more personal.

"This is a common debate amongst people in marginalized groups. To what extent do you 'play the game,' acquiesce to the system for some personal benefit, safety  or security, and to what extent do you challenge and resist, so as to not perpetuate systems of oppression? I think Contra trys to make strong arguments on each side of the debate to demonstrate the tensions and competing outlooks through character conversations. Reducing it to 'Which viewpoint is Contra endorsing' is a little simplistic. I imagine she is more on the side of freedom of self expression and challenging gender essentialism and narrow gender presentation, but she probably sees the valid concerns of folks less on her side.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Justine portrays insecurity and the way society forces us to adapt to its norms and expectations, however, she makes insightful remarks about our modern day politics and the Machiavellian approach we might take to draw attention to a cause we believe in that challenges those norms, even if it comes at the expense of being honest with oneself. Tabby portrays brazen defiance and an unwillingness to compromise even an iota of what one is, and she believes much of what society thinks is merely an old heritage that should be reexamined and challenged, and that accommodating these norms, even for the sake of changing them, merely serves to perpetuate them and further marginalize people who don't fit into those norms through fault of their own. Neither is Natalie however. She doesn't give any simplistic answer, but clearly, her heart leans towards Tabby. Ater the Kavanaugh hearings, and the way the media just brushed off his anger and rudeness, a generosity they wouldn't have extended to his accuser had she acted the same way, and after Trump said that a female reporter never thinks and the response by the media was focused on the way the reporter handled herself gracefully, I cannot help but rethink about how complex the issue is. It is already difficult for cis women so I cannot imagine what it is that trans women face. Natalie is brave for portraying these two embattled extremes and the way she does it is brilliant because again, she doesn't offer any simplistic answer because any simplistic answer would be a betrayal to the immense complexity of this issue.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"long time contra fan (first heard about her in 2016) here but i gotta critique this one tbh. (not some sort of harsh rebuke, just some suggestions and some observations/feelings i had during this video.)   i feel like this binary dichotomy of 'femme = assimilationist/gatekeeping = rational and charismatic' vs 'butch = radical = angry and violent' is way too simplistic. it erases loud femmes, angry femmes, counterculture femmes and at the same time kinda stigmatizes glamor in a way by associating it with more safe/conformist political views (when in fact high femmes have had a major role in radical trans activism for decades).   and as an anarchist Contra fan, I initially loved the Tabby character as a figure of good-nature ribbing between leftist sects (she's one of my favs), but at this point it's getting frustrating when even the centrist assimilationist lady is reading fucking judith butler for some reason, the nazi is a glamorous supervillain but the uncompromisingly anti-authoritarian and intersectional leftist just makes violent threats and hisses at people. the whole thing was structured like an 'own the libs' video kinda.   additionally, even the whole tv montage about the common threat or what have you zooms in scandalously on a 'mannish' trans women saying something threatening to a bigot before cutting to blaire white talking about how other trans people make her look bad. what's up with that? i thought tabby's speech about how it's valid to be a woman with a beard or a broad chest or etc etc was genuinely beautiful, and then the person discouraging her from promoting intersectionality is portrayed as the more reasonable and informed debater   some of the things said about butch and androgynous women & femmes in this video made me genuinely personally uncomfortable, as an autistic AMAB enby who's often felt dysphoria that people would perceive me as toxic masculine for being loud, interrupting people (often unintentionally) etc. coming from a very cis-passing, abled and 'Aryan'-looking trans woman, these sorts of fictionalized statements about 'you will never pass', 'society will always look down on you' etc do not feel like punching up or expressing sympathy when addressed towards butch and androgynous people.   in the end, i guess i just think that on a channel called ContraPoints that's dedicated to combating the right and taking away the stigma around socialism and gender studies, it doesn't make sense to spend *that* much time on making fun of antifa activists and queer anti-assimilationists for acting crazy and violent or w/e. meanwhile the nazi character is never portrayed as violent or threatening, even tho white supremacism is a leading cause of terrorism, beatings and homicides.   additionally, i wish that more of the content actually explored aesthetics and the lovable artist drag queen character, i was really looking forward to a video that be like introducing gender or decoding the alt right, but about the history of aesthetic philosophy with Plato and Kant and then the impact of modernism and postmodernism etc. in the end, i think this was a good premise for a video but it kinda got derailed. it just felt like a transcript of the exact kind of toxic twitter drama that lead me to quit most social media.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"If gender is founded on appearances, on aesthetic, then it become actually possible to be a woman even if you were born a man.  If nature determines sex/gender, then there's nothing you can do about it. Your Y chromosomes make you male forever (or until with get insanely good at gene therapy)  But if you only have to look and behave like a woman, then it is entirely within the realm of the possible as you now only need to pass off as a women.  This really lowers the bar for gender changes, but at the same time it puts 'the others' as the final judge of whether your succeeded.   So compared with just self-identification as being the only requirement to become a women, then this is harder, however nobody is seriously accepting self-identification as the sole criteria from gender acknowledgement   I think this is probably the most viable strategy for trans gender and 'non-binary' people to get acceptance and recognition as being gender other than their physical birth gender.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think that the fundamental problem is not that optics supersede the authentic self. That we are in a circus rather than a forum is because our reality is warped by a reactionary narrative. To understand this we must first understand that we live in a nihilist society where tradition is upheld not in a reverence of the past but an acute sense of cynicism for the future.   The difference of something being 'aesthetic' or 'authentic' is that authentic things affect more than the subject in question. For something to be authentic, it has to be 'intrinsic' and maintain its forms regardless of circumstance. Something aesthetic is 'extrinsic' and will bend to suit the environment it is in. As a pretentious comparison: An famous painting and its replica.  The original doesn't only affect the artist and their audience. Any work ripples through culture and, regardless of its longevity, will leave an impact however small it may be.  A replica is devoid of this trace, it can't reproduce the impact the original had created simply because the original already exists. A photoshopped picture is one which had never been taken by a real camera and whose people on it never met in that instance. The replica will never be made from the exact brush strokes at the exact same time the original was.    If a cis man does all the things a trans woman would do he doesn't become a trans woman simply due to this 'ripple effect' being absent. A cis man will willingly change his behavior to whatever society sees as 'masculine'. A trans woman can't and must by definition be coerced. For something to be authentic it has to be felt even when it is there no longer. Same for a man straight that only sleeps with men.  So you may be wondering, what does this have with the reactionary narrative clouding our judgment? If something is new it is hard to see if it is real because it doesn't have a legacy upon which everything traditional rests. The reactionary right-wing answer is to assume the worst and reject every form of real change or progress. They mimic authenticity by pretending to be in touch with the past, calling on myths and legends which never happened. This is also the source of their incessant projection, they can't comprehend a world which is authentic in its own right. For them, only the optics of legacy exist. That's why they embrace aesthetic reason because it furthers their agenda. They can't be reasoned with because they never came to their conclusions through authentic reason.     As one of the comments already pointed out, if a doctor is a miracle healer but doesn't have a degree they are still a doctor. We shouldn't submit to this right-wing distortion rather we should assert our authenticity through collaboration and resistance of tradition so we can end this circus and build our forum on its ashes.

"thanks for this video.  it's helped me understand something about trans people that's never really made sense to me before. there's a point early in most trans women's journey which i can't help but think of as 'the panto dame phase' -and it's generally annoying at best and patronising to all women at worst.  this is the phase that leads to so many people saying stuff like 'i don't mind as long they act like women'  it's weirdly similar to the 'barbie pink' phase that most little girls go through before the age of ten, overuse of make-up and all.  it's the phase when little girls work out what kind of skirts you like (and how often you're going to get groped when you wear them) where you play with styling your hair, learn how to apply lipstick and blusher, and dress as a princess.  most little girls grow out of it to some degree, some reject it all quite early and start wearing combat boots and jeans (like myself) and some embrace it wholeheartedly and become hairdressers.  I'd never really thought before about how trans women have to go through all the awkward lessons of womanhood that i learned in primary and pre-school, while they are adults... that's really got to be tough.  just because i'm ignorant doesn't mean i disapprove, i just don't get it... thank you for helping me to understand","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Because they are.) don't know how to approach you? Fuck, you lot get mad even at the attempt, because it inevitably didn't match what you and only you perceive how your encounters should play out.  A more contentious demographic than trans people there isn't. That's your problem more than anything else, you're confused and irate toward the world for being just as confused about you as you are yourself. Then there's all the aspersions you cast on the rest of the world who don't deserve it, which does little to endear them to your plight. Calling someone a nazi, sexist, homophobe, transphobe, whatever-the-fuck else you can think of to imply normal well meaning people are in some way possessed of irrational hate. Then you wonder why you all have a reputation for being sensitive... but I digress, this has become a bit of a rant.  I guess that's part of it too, there's so much to unpack here, and shockingly not all of it is various elaborations on how wrong the world is for being the way it is, but maybe, just maybe, you all aren't faultless yourselves.

"When looking at something like 'socal reform' and everything that phrase means, tact needs to be taken into account. Currently gay people have been seen in a very nutural normalized light but weither or not bad public apperence has been the cause of trans people not being in that same boat it really dosn't help.   damage control is something every group, orginization, company and person has to do at some point and if your aesthetic for anything the astetic dose play into that argument. now if you want to have a disscussion with someone attacking them, threatining them isnt helping your cause, it deems you irrational and dangerious, someone who dosnt want to listen to reason so you need to be met with the same forms of violince.   its not a issue of femininity being violent, its a issue of practicality. no matter what cause you are advocateing, haveing the astetic of understanding calmness and rationality will help you in the long run.   or thats my wishful thinking when we have this sensationalized political divide that will hopefully not end in a civil war brought upon by culture.   end of the day everyone has the right to do what they want look what they want say what they want, even if its misgendering people or saying that your a gender yourself.   but if you want the landscape to change, rome wasnt biult in a day, it takes time for people to understand and acsept new things and bombarding the uninitiated with too many conflicting contradicting images muddys the water and makes it harder to understand, and of corse people hate what they dont understand..","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Full disclosure, I'm cis white woman, so take my opinion for the grain of salt that it is, but this is so deep. What Justine is wrong morally, but what she says is true in reality, cis-passing trans-person are taken more seriously than non-passing person (particularly women), and I can't possibly imagine how frustrating that is for a trans person. And it's not like cis women are taken that seriously in our society anyway, so I can't imagine how infuriating and hard it is for transwomen. I can understand how a trans person can have these conflicting feelings too. Like I'd be a huge liar if I said I didn't try to conform to the male idea of feminity, and again I'm cis, and I hate that I have these ingrained ideas of feminity in my brain.   I really am having a hard time putting into words how much I feel this video as a personal level in a wide concept because I also don't want to take away from the point of video.

"There's been some criticism about this video.  As a transwoman not living full-time, I need to reexamine it.  I was, frankly really drunk upon my first viewing.  Note:  Google Chrome apparently doesn't like the word 'transwoman.'  Edit 1: I'm half way through the video, and it's obvious to me that you're playing Devil's Advocate, and Tabby is the real voice in the video.  Edit 2: I think most of the controversy is coming from well-intentioned cis-people who have no personal sort of perspective on the matter.  It's an idealized concept of transpeople.  I'm 6'2' (about 2 meters) and I am stocky even by male standards.  I have something of a baby face which has helped me to 'pass' now and then, but I work in fast food and I can barely afford my HRT let alone laser hair removal or surgery.  Perhaps this video was bound to be divisive, but there are realities to 'the aesthetic.' I am a woman, but my facial hair still grows, and without regular grooming, I'd have a beard.  I've been told my 'feminine' voice is good, but my default, comfortable voice, is fairly deep.  My breasts have grown since starting HRT, but they are hardly outside the realm of 'man-boobs' visually. I think this video is a realistic ode to the anxieties of being a transwoman, and wanting to be perceived as a woman.  In an idealized world, my identity should just be accepted for what it is.  In the real world, however, the waters get murky and my gender identity is partially negated by others' perception of me.  Every time I get gendered male, it brings me back to a dark place just a bit.  My only way to overcome that is by matching the 'Aesthetic.' Basically, I get the complaints, but even well-intentioned cis-people should keep their noses out to some extent.  They just don't get the context intrinsically.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"While I understand why people might be upset over this video, I think it's a very important and necessary video.  Justine and Tabby are the voices I think so many trans women have inside of them, as least I know I do. Transitioning feels like this tightrope where you're always trying to balance your true self and the expectations society places on you. So many people won't recognize you as a woman unless you 'play the part' and 'dress the part' -- that's Justine's side. But fighting for women so that societies expectations become something more flexible is a noble thing to do -- we should all be able to be ourselves and that's Tabby's side. I don't think you're supposed to side with one or the other necessarily but hear them both out. And yes it's a sad video, but it's also a very true video -- a truth many of us are afraid to talk about but feel on a daily basis. I'm glad there was some honest discourse here.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Being tall, or broad shouldered, or hairy.   Whenever I hear people say shit like 'trans women should just TRY to look like women' I've always thought...excuse me? what does that even mean?

"You honestly slay queen! You're gorgeous! And honestly I'm battling an inner war with myself because I identify as a trans man but I think that I would be feminine sometimes. I know, that because of that I wouldn't be taken seriously as a man especially in a business/work environment with other stuffy suited men and women who follow gender stereotypes, all around me. And I'm constantly feeling the pressure to be extra feminine while struggling to find a job and interviews to show yes I'm an attractive woman please hire me where as I don't know for how long I will actually be a woman or if I actually will want to transition because of all these, and other, issues. I know it's strange to even want to transition to male but still retain some femininity as this could be seen as a weakness by other, older, more powerful cis men and women, when I already have a small feminine frame. Even though you talk about the trans women experience I still feel like this is relevant for me too, because what could be as invalidating as rejecting the stereotypes of the gender you identify as for many people? So, just to be taken seriously, you can't want to deviate from the status quo especially when you want to fit in, for some groups more than others. I've growing up never really strongly rejected femininity and their stereotypical activities, but through the years I just didn't like to be called a girl or female gendered words in my language but I didn't really think that was a sign of anything at the time, now I know but the fact remains that I don't hate feminine things like jewelery and flowery patterns and colours, this will be considered un-masculine and I'm 'not really a trans man I just wanted the advantages of being a man' is what I think they would say but nonetheless aren't unlikely. Anyways I know this is a long comment but I guess if you take anything from this is that I do agree that there is this unspoken rule of any group, you have to have x, y, z to be considered as part of the group which can really devalue someone if they don't follow all but one thing. Which sucks but people like to group people and things and we like organising things so when we can't organise something we don't like it even if its not something that's inherently bad.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I respect Natalie's work on Contrapoints. But I have to say, the video made me think that trans women define womanhood in ways that reflect their lack of experience with how being a biological female in this society profoundly shapes one's sense of self. One fundamental experience is being made to feel less human, less worthy, less everything than men in a million ways, big and small, from the moment you're born. Becoming aware of yourself as a sexual object during early adolescence, receiving advances from 30 and 40 year olds when you're 14 and clueless. Being made to think sex is something a girl gives up and a guy takes. Coming to terms with the fact that unintended pregnancy can ruin your life. It's about struggling to claim any voice, any space, in a male dominated world. Doing most of the mental and emotional labor if you're in a heterosexual relationship. I think I'm feeling all of this rather keenly, as are many women, in light of the fact that the U.S. Senate is about to confirm a lying sexual predator to the Supreme Court. That is, it ain't all aesthetics and performance.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Most of the time you have to come up with your own answers. And not expect someone else to give them to you. Thinking for yourself can be hard but all adult human beings have to do it. Others can help but it is up to us in the end. This should be judged in context of her other works.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It's a choice of self, and your motivations have to be solid within you to take further steps. No video is going to make or break a questioning person who watches this, and if they don't understand these points on an intellectual level, they'll understand them from an experiential level as they transition.   As a non binary person, I've been thinking about these ideas for a long time.

It's became a larping club, with the Mao and Stalin memes and the hammer and sickle as the new peace sign and when you dig deeper few actually take the ideology seriously or the fact that we have the entire 20th century to learn from the victories and the deep mistakes of past attempts they just throw it in the trash and say they are 'libertarian socialists' which is the contemporary version of what 'Chinese aligned Communist' was to the European left awakening in the late 1960s.

"People who are acting like Justine 'won' or was intended to 'win' in this video strike me as a bit hypocritical, because ultimately... that's all optics.  No-one stated in this video that Justine was right or that Tabby was wrong, so your interpretation of the video is due to your own perception. If Justine 'won' the argument, it's because you believe she did. Your ultimate concern was not with truth, but with aesthetics. You took a look in the mirror and did not like what you saw.  There's no shame in that; there's a part of all of us that thinks like this even if it's antithetical to our conscious identity.

"actually, my comment from last week wasn't strong enough. here's my real feelings. and i say all of this with love, natalie. this is just as much directed at the comment section of this video as it is at you.  the problem is twofold:   1. you kinda end up claiming to speak for the trans community with this 'harsh truth' thing. that's not how i feel at all. i don't feel any more like a man than i did when i wasn't on testosterone, and i don't have days where i think i'm just fooling myself. this idea that we all have to 'face' that sends a really gross message about trans people as a whole, and this 'i guess we'll never know' middle-of-the-ground thing doesn't work when you're honestly just representing one side, and clearly favoring it as more 'real'.   you essentially end up implying tabby - and by extent, all of us who aren't internally monstrously transphobic - are just trying to 'comfort' ourselves. i like challenging media, i like difficult media, and i completely agree that all art is problematic. i like the videos where you're is open and honest about her struggles, the transphobia and rightwing, and the ending isn't always positive or comforting... but i don't like this fake horseshoe-theory bs where every argument is always in the middle of the road, no matter how terrible one of the sides is, and any art gets a pass because it's so Real and Challenging. it's not.  my problem with the video is the opposite - it's complete nonsense in regard to how i and many other trans people feel. and i've supported natalie as someone who is, yes, problematic and figuring things out - but it's how she talks OVER other people in this one, that carries the real sting. i don't 'disown' her or claim that she can never make mistakes - but this is a huge one, and as a wise tabby once said, anger can absolutely be a rational response.    this idea that you can't be hurt by things that are false and misrepresentative without it reflecting some '''harsh truth''' is actually very well deconstructed in one of natalie's best videos - the one about autogynephilia. go watch that one, since a lot of you commenters kinda forgot about it in your tirade. i don't feel like my gender is 'cancelled' by misgendering - i internally laugh at those people and feel frustrated at the world, not cry at myself.    2. i've watched every single one of natalie's videos. you don't need to tell me that i need to put it into context. parts of this comment section - and parts of this video - without intending to, end up very condescending towards people who are hurt. we're not hurt because we take it all at face value, or assume that 'justine' is supposed to be right. i'm a media critic and analyst myself, so i completely understand the impulse to tell people that some art can't be taken at face value, but we both know that intent and the message received are not the same thing... and with these vague 'it's a part of a context' and 'the bigots would have hated us anyway' arguments, you are essentially dismissing it and telling us all to come together in one big hug. in other words, it's the same thing we've been told before from the right-wing: 'shut up and be glad someone is there to represent you better than you can yourself'.   i'm not in the business of suggesting 'fixes' to media, and i'm absolutely one of those people who feel those 'fixes' misses the point in the first place. so i'm not going to say that you, natalie, needs to be more comforting - but i AM going to say, you need to be more open about your own naivety and subjectivity. if natalie wants to do that in an artful and vague way, so be it. she's done it before, and that was plenty challenging, too. if she had made this video about a person, depicted as morally grey and saying a bunch of transphobic shit about herself and others (such as tiffany tumbles), then i would have accepted that. the problem is in the subtext of what tabby ISN'T allowed to say, that she can't mount a critique against this tirade of self-hatred, generalizations and permissive cisnormativity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I want to get into this and voice my objections..... but I just don't care. The role of womanhood largely arose over which sex gave birth to children. The fact hormone therapy is needed is somewhat indicative of the fact that sex, to some degree, IS a biological reality. I'm getting the impression these videos are you trying to convince yourself sex/gender arent biologically contingent. Of course there's a biological basis for gender dysphoria, but gender dysphoria kind implies there is gender to begin with..... which there is. You can only reach these conclusion if you adopt some radical uber relativist postmodern perspective that just isn't practical where actions do have consequences. Regardless if you think the 'goodness' or 'badness' are subjective. Good is simply what works. Pragmatism. You are beautiful, but I think you're being a little dogmatic. Certainly open to hear varying perspective.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"The way I understand the video is that they may disagree on how but their goal is the same- to protect trans women. One is aggressive one is conservative. What we need to do is balance both- because coming off too aggressive hurts the cause and gives trans women a bad name but not everyone can or wants to pass so you cant force everyone to conform to societies norms. So in my opinion this video and argument is valid and important to talk about because its all about understanding the common goal and the flaws in both ideals.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think that the problem with this whole debate is that you are ignoring the scientific reasons behind the existence of trans people. Gender identity has biological basis.Therefore, a trans woman is different from a male crossdresser in the first place, because she has different brain development which leads to gender dysphoria. That affects her on many levels, including the motivation behind transitioning, the amount of inner insecurities, gender expression and behaviour. In my opinion this biological and neurological distinction makes her a woman. However, you cannot function as a woman socially unless you look like one in terms of your anatomy. It doesn't matter whether you are wearing high heels or lipstick or no makeup at all. As long as your body is perceived as a female body, you will experience misogyny. If not, you will experience misandry as a gender nonconforming AMAB person. That is why feminism is unable to protect trans people and expecially trans women from oppression, as it only focuses on misogyny while transfeminine individuals are not always perceived as cis women and experience misandry. Here is an example: a non-passing trans woman has to go through medical exams, because there is military conscription in her country. She is forced to run naked in the corridors of the medical institutions together with young men. All of them are denied basic privacy, because they are perceived as men. Doctors mock her for having long hair and nail polish, and she has to spend a few weeks in a mental institution to prove that she can't serve in the military due to being transgender. That humiliating procedure that exists in many countries of the world is pure misandry that feminism has no concern about (and we can't blame feminists for that, as they are fighting for women's rights, not men's). But who is going to protect that poor trans girl? Does the fact that she is suffering from male issues devalue her traumatic experience? Hardly. But it is time to acknowledge that we need to care about men's rights too when dealing with trans people for their own benefit.The experience of oppression that nonpassing trans women have is practically much more similar to what gender non-conforming AMAB people have to deal with.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I can relate to what Justine says a lot. I'm a transmasc person, so my situation is different, but at the moment I very much feel like I'm just 'faking it til I make it'. I'm not being read as male. Even (most of) the people who call me by the correct name and pronouns see me as a woman and just kinda humor me by using the language that I prefer. That's one reason why I think the idea of RLE is so stupid. I can't experience what it's like to live as a man before medically transitioning. It's impossible. Right now, my experience is more me pretending to be a man while clearly being read as a gender non-conforming woman. And I often lie awake at night trying to figure out what it even is that makes me a man, then. Simply identifying as one seems weak to me and does not really match how I feel and what I experience. So what is it? I don't know. I know there's a ton of problematic ideas hidden in this comment (like the idea that you can't live as a man if you don't medically transition) but that's how I've been feeling for the last few months and this video really made me think a lot so I wanted to write this down.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I waited a few days before slamming the comment button or tweeting out so I could process things and well my view has not changed on this, I love your work normally, some stuff is frustrating but you never agree on every video that's fine but I do hope you listen to some criticism on this and not brush everyone off as 'Their just angry twitter lefty transbians, just don't look at twitter.' and while it's true there is a lot of unjust vitriol online, there are also valid reasons people are hurt by this and the take away could do more harm than good.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm feeling some cognitive dissonance around Tabby. I get that you do a lot of exaggerated charicatures. And I feel hypocritical that it's easier to laugh at the ones I don't agree with (Basically all of them except Tabby). And I get that many of the criticisms you have of her are based in some validity behind the exaggerations.  But I can't help that feel that your constant debating and borderline disavowal of her revolutionary leftism is designed to win over liberals and centrists by showing there are people more extreme than you and that you aren't like them. And I don't want to call it punching down because leftist is a political alignment independent of any privileges or oppressions you hold, but it definitely doesn't feel like good solidarity. At least with your debates with your TERF or Fash charicatures you take the time to research what are saying to make sure you aren't engaging in a straw man fallacy, and your purpose behind them seems pretty clear: ending fascism and trans misogyny. But I don't see that same sort of diligence paid to Tabby, and I don't get what her purpose is. At times it feels like you are flirting with respectability politics by shitting on her but then you have these moments of sincerity towards her where it feels like maybe Tabby is actually an internal dialogue with yourself?  Idk. Shits complicated. And I'm not trying to tell you what to do. Your praxis and your rhetoric are light years beyond mine. I think maybe I'm just asking for clarity. Who is Tabby? Why does she exist? And what do you intend for her?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I definitely like the video. It's very nuanced and I never really thought of a trans person 'being robbed of their identity' by simply calling them by a pronoun that they don't identify as. It's pretty much a culture-shock when you go for so long being referred to as a woman to have a snobby person refer to you as a man. I can't say I wholeheartedly understand the problem you face, but I can say that I definitely feel bad for you.  That said, the problem with this argument is simply that the definition of 'woman' is defined by society, too, instead of what genitalia a person has. I believe this is where majority of arguments fall flat because _forcing_ me to call someone a pronoun because they identify as what society identifies stereotypes as gender is akin to forcing me to say that white is blue on the grounds that _you_ said to. I feel like appending this exception to the first amendment to accommodate this is extremely complicated, and only really worth doing if the population of trans becomes way bigger, at which point it'd be more acceptable, maybe even courteous to call someone by what they want to be known as socially. I mean, we already do it with names.  I realize there are a lot of flaws with my argument, too. For example, just because a small portion of the population has an issue and the rest don't, doesn't make it any less of an issue, and it should still be addressed. I won't deny that it's super unfair to trans people to have to face this problem most likely every day, but I also won't deny that some change will eventually happen on it's own, completely naturally.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Ewww I'm with Tabby on all of these points. I've never passed, and the day I do is the day I change what I'm doing and how.  Those of us who can smash should smash. Cis women smash just as much as we do, they're just sneakier about it, and sometimes they just manipulate men into doing their smashing.  Besides that whole 'point' about being raised a white college boy is bullshit. That mantle isn't helpful, it's heavy. I was raised like that by Mormons, and then went to the Marine Corps to get the hell away from them. I've only been out since 2014. Just coming out got me homeless, jobless, drugged at one point, raped at a later. . . I haven't even been on HRT consecutively in the last 4 years. It's been a hellish nightmare for me, and I don't give a damn. That's a reality some cis women live too. I don't have to be dolling up 24/7 and living the 'basic bitch' way of life to be considered a real woman. If Carrie Fisher can stay inside, an strung out for years so the fuck can I.   Also I was once perceived as a man among men, and that was its own fresh hell . . . Trans women are still women before they transition. Living stuck in the life being perceived as a cis man while not a cis man is like I said it's own hell. Or can't you remember ever being trusted by the worst of men Justine? Were you always so androgynous that you were never considered one of the men?  If trans women are more violent than perhaps it's because we come from a more violent place more often than not.  I was beaten violently by my grandmother since I was 5. She literally held me down, and poured vinegar down my throat until I choked one day because of my baby brother breaking something and I told the truth that he had done it. . . but of course I must be lying, and blaming the not even 1 year old. . . because an old bitch didn't bother baby proofing her home before her white trash daughter came back to her abusive home. Any excuse to hit me was used to hit me until I snapped and kicked her back one day when she was chasing me with a broom handle. I put her in the emergency room with one well placed kick while braced against the corner of a room in Buffalo NY in 1996. Like I said cis women are just as violent, and trashy as cis men. They're just fucking liars about it usually. I was probably lucky I didn't have a father in the picture, because most trans women I know with abusive parents have violent or even rapey fathers.   Also what on earth is this whole 'white college boy' thing anyways? As if we have to be a trans woman of color to talk about the trans women of color who have been murdered? As if we have to be a first nations person to remind everyone of the genocide against Native Americans that are still going on to this day? I was literally in high school in Lehi High. I've been driven all around that State as a kid/teen. I saw the reservations, and I saw the buses that took NATIVE KIDS to MORMON SEMINARY where they would be taught that being brown was a curse from God.  The way that Justine acted like Tabby was somehow appropriating the struggles of trans women of color was really gross sounding.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm delighted to see a video that looks at what radicalism could look like if aesthetic concerns superseded 'moral' ones.  Whereas Justine is the main mouthpiece for the idea in this video, and she's presented as wrong about plenty of things, it's not her prioritization of the aesthetic that's shown to be problematic but her narrow idea of what counts as aesthetically acceptable.  Tabby eventually gets her to budge on this by admitting that it's important to be yourself and imitating other people is 'a bad look'.  If all we had was the Tabby vs Justine argument I think we'd be left pretty stuck without an idea of how to proceed, because Justine's vision of what's a 'good look' is still so very other-driven and Tabby is still pretty gung-ho on the smashing, even as it doesn't serve her.  Meanwhile, as addressed, this debate taking place between two highly-passing, privileged women falls short of serving those outside that narrow category.  None of this is really solved aside from the provisional reconciliation they reach because they are both trying to survive. That's why I think the frame narrative with Tracy Mounts (sp?) is so brilliant and crucial here.  Remember that from the perspective of this particular video, Tabby and Justine aren't real, they're characters in a VHS tape.  Tracy is the host and essentially the center.  And who is Tracy?  'A lady who used to be a man dressed as a man dressed as a lady,' who is rocking some beautiful *peak* CAMP aesthetic and musing on the relationship between gender and color.  Tracy embodies the possibility of her own stand-alone *aesthetic of queerness*.   And why compare gender to color?  I don't think it's just because colors, like gender, are 'kinda based on science, kinda an illusion.'  Analogous color schemes run on a /spectrum/ and Complimentary color schemes are /binary/ (see what Contra did?) - but is any one more aesthetic than another?  No, both are crucial and beautiful.  But also it's not aesthetic to use any old color scheme in any old context - in color theory as in anything else 'context matters,' as do people's basic preferences for color, all of which are subject to change.  Meanwhile there are other kinds of color schemes (tertiary color schemes that have one of each primary or secondary color, split complimentary schemes that use a color and its compliment's two nearest neighbors but not its compliment), the existence of which would render a debate as to 'which is the best - analogous or complimentary?' silly. If gender is like color, then use of gender is an aesthetic thing that exists at the *intersection* of social expectations and unprompted individual self-expression.  Like color we can use it any way we think suits us, and yet we are always in a position to receive unsolicited (and almost always invalid) pushback over how we do.  I think Tracy/Contrapoints/Natalie is showing that we can paint with gender like an artist paints with color.  We can all be Gender Artists.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I understand these characters are not you, and that there are subtle narrative devices in place, so that 'this was a debate and Justine won because: better use of aesthetics (so, non-binary and/or non-passing trans people LDAR)' is not what you wanted viewers to take away from this. Your actual point, or actual question posed through this video, is very muddied and unclear though. In that way it feels like a huge contrast to your videos debunking fascist, 'alt-right,' and white supremacist propaganda. In those, you sometimes had a character representing a fashy point of view the but video made it pretty clear where *you* stand and no one would walk away from those videos feeling that they'd just been recruited into the 'alt-right' or that you, Contra, agree with the 'alt-right.' Justine's words were deeply invalidating to a wide range of trans people- all but those who are binary, *and* gender-conforming, *and* have accessed medical transition. And even for the narrow slice of trans people who 'pass as cis' extremely well, her words set up such a long list of issues to be self-conscious and insecure about- from how to move one's body, to how to react to assholes, etc, that anyone trying to follow her advice could easily develop Tiffany-Tumbles-levels of toxic (perhaps lethal) internalized oppression.  And all of it based in the quite possibly misguided premise that 'winning hearts and minds' of cis moderates through meticulous conformity & 'agreeableness' is the only and best way to achieve trans liberation. Nevermind that the Stonewall Rebellion didn't follow this formula, nor did many effective movements for social change. Arguably, buying-in to respectability actually harms movements like this (especially if It's an uncritical embrace of dominant norms to achieve a single-issue political end). It's very, very unfortunate that Tabby is presented as such an empty caricature of the Left that she can't offer a deeper, more historically grounded counter-argument to respectability politics. Another difference I strongly feel between this video, versus your brilliant past anti-'alt right' work, is that while I have never had to work/organize/regularly interact with someone who resembled your 'alt right' caricatures, I have definitely had to navigate interactions with many real-life Justines. I have had others within the trans community (1) assume I'm politically/strategically naive, (2) offer condescending 'advice' often focused on appearance (3) and actively try to invalidate and exclude me from political work because I am either/both non-binary and a leftist. Honestly, if any of them watched this video, I don't think they'd understand the subtle twists. I think they'd feel validated, like you agreed with them. I hope in the future your videos can return to the rhetorical clarity they once had. I also hope you'll consider listing trans-affirming suicide prevention resources on any video that has anti-trans content, repeats or examines anti-trans tropes, etc. It's rough out here and this video definitely sent some community members spiraling.

"What is this video","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I agree with the implication of the romantic take on aesthetics near the end of the video - aesthetics doesn't HAVE to be false. We're used to thinking of aesthetics as the 'false front', the mask, the marketing, the propaganda. But that's only when aesthetics is being used to dominate and control. All aesthetics is is appearance, and the reality of appearance varies by context.  Human beings, all human beings, are corrupt. Which means that our aesthetics are never pure, never devoid of falsity. ALWAYS a performance. Even the 'sophisticated nihilist' who supposedly is beyond all mortal concerns has to perform in order to be socially *viewed* as a sophisticated nihilist.  I've spent a reasonable amount of my life not performing in society, and the outcome of this is that I was incomprehensible to other people. People understand others ONLY through performance - the absence of performance is the absence of identity. Not personal, private identity, perhaps, but public identity.  People refuse, absolutely refuse, to experience something incomprehensible. They became upset when I did not perform an identity, and when I continued to not perform they would invent my identity and then subject me to that identity.  Here's what I think this comes down to - people feel that they *have* to perform in society in order not just to gain power within society, but simply to exist in society. But they also feel on some level that something is lost, that a kind of innocence, a kind of pureness, of simply BEING, is being destroyed BY THEM.  Only by everyone SHARING in this destruction, only by ensuring that *everyone* performs, is the social crime of performance acceptable. Once some people stop performing, the feelings of guilt that the performers constantly feel start coming to the surface. But instead of self-reflection, the performers institute social and political controls on the non-performers, attempting to get them to conform to the culture of performance.  I disagree with Contrapoints's assertion that performance is necessary. If you're trying to gain power in the world performance is highly useful. If you're trying to be moral, to do what's right, and you believe that non-performing is moral and performing is immoral, then don't perform.  But Contrapoints is completely correct that society will make you pay for not performing. Society cannot abide it's own ignorance, and for a human being to not *help them out*, to not put themselves into an identity box FOR THEM to consume in easily digestible fashion, is, at least according to our society, a crime worthy of social censure, or worse.  For someone to not perform implies that society is the criminal, and that society's culture of performance is in need of censure. Needless to say, society does not simply roll over and accept this conclusion - it fights back, hurts and destroys whatever it feels it needs to to prevent coming to terms with itself.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I really related to the debate presented in this video, especially the part about gender being a performative effort. I came out as gay several years ago, and I thought that would once and for all  'correct' my inner homophobia, or at least redirect me to a more productive headspace, but it did not. Oftentimes I still feel like my old self years and years ago, so terrified of being 'found out' that I would consciously think of my movements, my gait, my voice; micromanaging every single perceivable trait so as to not get 'clocked.' I still struggle with that today, to the point where every interaction in the public space, especially with strangers, feels like I'm holding a cup filled to the brim with water that I must never spill while unicycling on a tightrope at the top of the Burj Khalifa. It has left me utterly devastated because even if I am technically out, I still engage in the performance of it all, and no single costume (for lack of a better word) feels right for me. It feels as if my internalized homophobia has left me permanently scarred, and that I must conform to what society perceives as acceptable in order for me to belong. But then, that violates my principles, and I feel as if that disposition invalidates why I came out in the first place. I don't have answers yet, and I doubt I will get them anytime soon. But I just want to say that this is a brilliant video, ContraPoints.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Justine was adopting a True Scum conformist defeatist stance.  Following her path can probably help a white trans woman who already has access to resources avoid some negatives associated with being trans, but it does nothing for virtually all other flavours of trans.  Coming off as passable or non-threatening doesn't stop those in power from being assholes against all the other trans people out there.  Tabby's path of radical self acceptance and revolt//resistance can lead to lasting positive change for other trans people, and eventually for the cis themselves.  We must stand up to power, build community in solidarity with eachother, and push for change instead of trying to fit in to an already flawed and sexist institution of femininity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think the solution might be something Natalie said as Justine in one of the earlier videos: being cool. Cool meaning appearing confident and in control of your emotions. By staying cool (while remaining approachable) you can make anything cool. Is it a kind of performance? Yes, but one that is used to express and make acceptable something unique and outside of prescribed norms - a synthesis of Tabby's drive for authenticity and Justine's knack for persuasion.   A great example is the character of Tyrion Lannister from Game of Thrones. Who would've thought a man with dwarfism could become a global icon of cool and sex appeal? Peter Dinklage made being a little person 'cool' through playing a character imbued with a deep, authentic charisma that embraces authenticity, collectedness, humor and vulnerability.  In the words of The Imp himself: 'Never forget what you are, the rest of the world will not. Wear it like armour and it can never be used to hurt you.' I think we transfolk (as well as other marginalised groups) can learn from that.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"the hallway walk made me a little gayer thanks   this is a great video that brings up a lot of points that transwomen face beyond cis women. transwomen have to work so incredibly hard to get to the sort of 'base level' of women hood that most feminists are trying to break out of.  as a genderqueer cis woman, i've always struggled with not feeling like i can or should be feminine, that is was something for thinner, prettier girls than me. that putting on make up or wearing my hair in such a way was entirely unacceptable and while i have in the past few years grown used to it as a form of art i perform for myself, i still can't move into a lot of traditional feminine roles. i still look at a bra or dress and thing 'that isn't for me'. the transwoman experience is so vastly different from my own and i support and love every transgirl out there. skinny, fat, pretty, masculine, pre-transition, post-transition.  i love you all! please do you however you feel you need to. <3","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Tabby, if Justine represents the beautiful then you represent the sublime... You invoke awe with your ability to quote 'revolutionary philosophers' off the top of your head. And you instil fear when you raise that baseball bat! lol... In any case, don't worry about it you are both numerically identical. What is true of one is true of the other.

"If Justine is correct, why transition at all? You can do more good to trans people the more acceptable you are to cis society, therefore the most acceptable thing to be would be a cis man. A cis male ally could speak definitively in favor of trans rights, and wouldn't ever have to worry about being an example of how bad trans women are.  To be clear, this is a reducto ad absurdum, I'm saying it to point out what I believe is a central flaw in Justine's position. Be the man, woman, or enby you are most comfortable being.  Also I really seriously take issue with the idea that the reason threatening violence in a discussion is bad is because it's unfeminine. That's both misogynistic and wrong.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Coming from the medical point of view, patients must always indicate their genetic sex (male: XY; female: XX) and if they are transgendered and if they take any medications such as hormone therapy and if they have had any previous surgical procedures (sex change). Really nothing to do with how you are percieved, but with how you are going to be medically treated. You are still different from a 'cis-woman' biologically and so you will be treated differently medically (for your benefit and so as to not confuse the doctor and medical staff). So I believe it must be required to state your genetic sex in medical papers. However, what sex you choose on your email account creation is your business...  In medical school, posession of the Y chromosome means you're a male. Lack of Y chromosome means female. This also applies to those with genetic mutations with sex chromosomes. For example: Klinefelter syndrome, gene 47, XXY is considered a male. This is because of the presence of the SRY gene (among other things) on the Y chromosome.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This was an incredibly disappointing video. The entire video, Justine is on the offensive, and Tabby is merely reactionary, offering up brief rebuttals to what Justine says. The entire conversation is weighted heavily towards Justine's point of view. Then at the end,  they both just kinda resign themselves. Regardless of what your intentions or true beliefs are, this frames it in a way that implies Justine is right. Except she's not. Tabby is clearly right in this situation. It's not a matter of nuance or grey areas - Tabby is just 100% correct and Justine is wrong. And the voice of reason has been reduced to a wacky, cardboard cutout.  Justine's argument - the argument of this video - is that performance matters more than personal identity. This is just false. This toxic idea is shared by many on the far right and even the trolls of TTTT you referenced in your recent Incels video. By giving their argument the favored argument in this skit, you're validating it.  Like, what are you even trying to say by showing the clip of Caitlyn Jenner threatening Ben Shapiro? How about you focus on the insidious transphobia of Shapiro and not 'lol look at this crazy trans woman.'  You must realize that as a trans content creator, a large part of your fanbase is also trans. And you know what? By making this video, you weren't just telling Tabby that she isn't valid for not performing womanhood right; you were telling a lot of them that too.  I'm not sure why you would decide to make a gatekeepy, TERFy video about how trans women who don't dress or look the way society deems normal are 'faking it til they make it' (those are YOUR words in the video) because they already get bombarded by that message on a daily basis.   And finally, according to Justine - who, again, is framed as being the correct one - you are either performing womanhood or you are a man. There is a complete erasure in this argument of NB and genderfluid people.  I'm still a fan  of yours, obviously. And I don't even think necessarily that you agree with Justine; I think you just accidentally wrote this debate in a way that constantly keeps her on the offensive, gives her a far greater amount of time speaking, and make it seem like we're supposed to come away from this either agreeing with Justine or thinking 'Wow both sides have a pont.' But I just hope that next time you put a bit more thought into your words and the effect they have.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Everything was always a spectacle. Every century was about the spectacle, it is only the form that has changed, not the fact that how you look is always 110% more important to the average person than what you're saying. The 19th century saw the rise of boxing, circuses, sports we know and love today, and advances in photography and later film allowed people to witness spectacle from increasingly exotic locations. The first people to fly weren't the Wright Brothers. A German immigrant named Gustave Whitehead beat them to manned flight. But the Wright Brothers had what he didn't - publicity and exposure. Debate in Athens used to be a kind of spectator sport, or similar to theater, it was making a stage play out of political issues of the time. The current year is not that different.

"While I appreciate the artistic style and the humor, and I recognize that the scope of this debate is within feminist conceptions of gender (gender as an internally experienced identity vs gender as an externally performed social role), I do not like the presentation of these two schools of thought as if they were the only viable views on gender. In fact, I'd argue that neither one is satisfactory in its own right:  If transgender feminism is correct and gender is an internally experienced identity, then what exactly does it 'feel' like to be a man/woman? Why is it that cis men and women are genuinely puzzled when it's suggested that it 'feels' a certain way to be a man/woman? And why is it that the only examples people seem to be able to point to of what it 'feels like' to be a man/woman are sexual experiences (i.e. what it's like to have sex as a man or as a woman), which are in fact attributable entirely to biological sex and not some subjectively experienced identity?  If queer feminism is correct and gender is an externally performed social role, then it's not at all clear that gender categories like 'man'/'woman' , 'boy'/'girl', 'him'/'her', etc. actually refer to what people mean by these terms. Ludwig Wittgenstein was correct in defining meaning as use - whatever we use a certain word to mean, that's what that word means. If we use 'man' to mean 'male adult human' (which is what most people do mean by the word, and the way it's typically understood), and queer feminism says that 'man' actually means 'person who performs the gender role typically associated with males', then queer feminism is mistaken (until such a time as we actually DO use gender designations that way). By the way, Wittgenstein was also correct in saying that you can't have your own private language - that's exactly what we're seeing with people who use this definition of gender, as they quickly get everybody confused and everybody starts talking past one another because they're playing incompatible language-games.  Neither of these theories of gender is satisfactory. In fact, the reason why they're not satisfactory is probably because they run parallel to the nature vs nurture debate (gender as an internal identity = gender is all nature; gender as an externally performed social role = gender is all nurture). Well, guess what? It's always both nature and nurture, and gender will undoubtedly prove no different.   I know Contra has done a video on gender in the past where she narrowed down all the viable theories of gender to feminist theories, but that doesn't mean those arguments are settled, and it doesn't entitle you to ignore all non-feminist perspectives on gender. Just because you stipulate that 'gender' is distinct from 'biological sex' does not mean that the words we typically think of as constituting gender actually ARE distinct from biological sex. Just because you establish a stipulative definition of 'gender' that you use in an academic context does not mean you get to impose that definition and pretend it's actually the lexical definition. These are all invalid moves, and it's not the way to have a discussion. (But if it's all politics anyway and politics is just aesthetics, then I guess it's valid. Well, it's not as if policies have actual real-world consequences and should be rationally determined in such a way that makes people in society better off, right?)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

This video isn't talking about how it should be, but rather, how it is. Unfortunately, we all know it, trans women who don't pass, aren't taken seriously by the larger community.

"About the helicopter example though... Can't we say that cats (or pets) are kind of social roles, and that in a sense, Tabby is performing this role in some ways? She hisses, people can look at her and see that she looks like a 'catgirl', she wants to be scratched? She performs 'felininity' just as much as 'femininity'. People perform animalistic social roles in furry fandom, kink, etc: the human expectation of what it means to be an animal, just like dragqueen shows are the male expectation of what it means to be a woman. People act differently towards pets than towards humans or wild animals. And humans, generally, tend to find it degrading to be 'treated like animals'.  Let's say that just like biological sex and gender may be defined differently, where gender is the social equivalent... could there perhaps be a social equivalent to the (biological) species?

"Amazing video, as always. That thing about 'being robbed of your gender' was spot on.  I think the best way to understand that is seeing trans people early in their transitions as teenagers during puberty (it's kind of what it is, a second puberty). Like, try misgendering an insecure young girl or boy, then see if they don't feel like shit and hate you forever.  For example, I am an heterosexual cis man, and I'm now pretty ok with my masculinity (I am 22, I have a massive beard, an high forehead, and get often mistaken for an older man in a somewhat neutral to positive way, so...), but I remember, when I was in middle school once I got misgendered by an old woman in front of my classroom just because I had long hair, no beard, and I'm very short. I assure you I wasn't at all feminine, and it was kind of a ridiculous situation, but it still felt like shit. When I said to her I was male, she was embarrassed and told me to cut my hair, my class laughed, and I hated her. I got over it in a few weeks.  If a person keeps getting misgendered into adulthood (thing that is very unusual for cis people, so it seems weird to them), they can either continue feeling like shit, become angry and bitter (see incel/trans parallel in Contrapoints' earlier video), or toughen up and don't give a fuck anymore, but it's still a shitty thing to do.  Cis people think it's not a big deal, but try being misgendered over and over, and over, and over again during a dinner or public meeting of sort, then tell me if it isn't irritating as fuck.  It makes you snap at a certain point. Also, if you're confident with your gender (like most adult cis people are), it's only irritating, but if you're not (like most trans people), it's soul-crushing.  In fact, it wouldn't be a problem to be 'less of a man', or 'less of a woman', if that didn't implicitly mean 'less of a person', and 'lesser' in absolute terms. So if you are in a situation where you just can't take it, it's not 'robbing you of your gender', but 'robbing you of your humanity'.  And I do not intend this in a 'monstrous unspeakable thing' sense, like torture and the like: every one of us experiences little moments of humiliation and dehumanization sometimes, without even realizing that. It's not uncommon, but it's still shit, and if you know with relative confidence that something is likely to have that effect, you could stop, just for common courtesy. Anyways... that was my rant to 'normies' (I kind of hate that word). Thanks for the patience. Feel free to quote me in any discussion you will happen to have with oblivious cis people on the matter, if you feel you're out of arguments to explain yourself :)  (what? I'm modest!

People who think appearances matter more than truth are, in my opinion, wrong.

I really believe you mean the best and I really appreciate what you've done for the trans and left YouTube communities, but the discourse in this video is, while covering an underlooked and rarely mentioned topic, doing so in a fairly derogatory manner. It's fine to make mistakes but you should probably take ownership of this one, because the script here is some serious /lgbt/ tier self loathing nonsense that isn't a majority opinion even among cis folks and isn't healthy for you or your viewers to internalize.

"If the argument is that women have been aesthetically conditioned by men to be appealing over the years, who is the radical feminist aesthetic appealing to? Or is the idea that women being appealing is a form of bondage? I'm reminded of that African tribe again, the one who put plates in their lips to make themselves unappealing to slavers - over time, the act lost its meaning as a warding-off thing and instead became something attractive. Suggesting that it doesn't matter how fucked-up a society makes its people look, they will eventually find that shit attractive. The beauty ideal a couple of centuries ago was plump women and most Rennaisance art depicts BBWs as icons of perfection - these days, that's a niche fetish and being slim is important. In Japan, women would blacken their teeth with soot and having black teeth was gorgeous. I think Radical Feminism has a very relative view of female beauty - stereotypical almost - and it doesn't account for differences in culture and the evolutions of the beauty aesthetic in general - and judging by the African tribe scenario, it doesn't really matter how much women try to make themselves unappealing to men: nature doesn't give a shit about their ideas.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think... I'm really going to have to disagree with you on this one, which doesn't happen that often. I don't think you can equate a job with gender identity, I think however you identify and in whichever ways you express femininity is an entirely psychological and personal experience, while a job you perform is extremely impersonal and I would say it's something the average person rarely if ever actually cares about on a personal level. Losing your job isn't terrifying because you can't do that job anymore, it's terrifying because you need a way to support yourself. One individual job isn't important. Being misgendered isn't terrifying because I won't be able to buy food otherwise, it's terrifying because I'm having that gender taken away from me, and that _is_ intrinsically personally important.   Additionally, I would argue that gender is _not_ purely a practical and social identity, it's just as much of a personal one. I don't understand how you can previously state that you 'can't sleep without a bra on, because you must feel something on your chest', and then state that your gender is only relevant when it comes to how people treat you. Sleeping with a bra on doesn't strike me at all as part of your unquenchable and slightly terrifying thirst for validation, but I also believe that it's more than just a 'daydream' you're having (stating that the experiences and struggles of pre-transition transwomen are 'daydreams' is disgusting, by the way. Do you also really not understand that transwomen don't like to be equated to drag queens? Under like, any circumstances?). That's part of a genuine and personal experience that you are experiencing alone, regardless of social judgement.   I really agree with Tabby when she says 'All your advice is just to turn me into you', because that's what it is. Natalie says 'My way is the right way, why aren't you all doing it my way?' Then you actually go out of your way to cause harm to people like Tabby who express it in their own way, which I personally recognise as perfectly valid aswell. I don't care if some transwomen wear cat ears and want to smash things, that's who they are. I feel content allowing them to live their lives without hunting them down and telling them they're not real women unless they wear dresses. It strikes me as, frankly, an extremely self-important and masculine worldview.  I feel that Natalie's worldview comes from a place of autocratic practicality, and of panic. She seems to have this desire to strategize the world's population of transwomen into a singular identity to forward some vague goal, but I would argue that there is always room for interpretation, thought, and discussion, in any community. I think transwomen with broad shoulders, bald heads, cat ears, and those who wear combat boots, should be welcomed as women just as much as the passing bourgeois. I also think they have just as much of a right to call themselves women. I think you're going to have to accept that some people just express their femininity differently to you, and I just don't understand how the trans community functions when the dominant mindset is that there is only a single brand of womanhood and that we all must follow, or get out. Am I so incredibly ostracised seriously just because I love people for who they are rather than telling them they're _being themselves incorrectly_ and telling them who they should be?  Furthermore, concerning strategization of the population, I just don't understand what the goal could possibly be. You won't 'win' politics, if that's what you want, the struggle between progressivism and conservatism will always exist. What could you possibly hope to gain by eliminating different interpretations of femininity and uniting transwomen under your singular ideal of womanhood? I don't really want to become an autocratic soldier, dedicated to the unflinching will of Natalie Wynn, so I guess I'm not welcome here. It scares me that this mindset is the dominant mindset in transwomen, because I don't feel safe around them. I don't really want to be hunted down and attacked because I don't resemble a 1950s housewife. That's just not my idea of femininity, but I guess according to Natalie that makes me the anti-christ. Yeah, I know she'd sarcastically say 'That must be so hard for you' or some such, and I know I'm not a starving African child or a disabled woman of colour living in the American ghettos, but that doesn't make my suffering literally completely irrelevant. It just strikes me as Natalie cherry picking the struggles that support her worldview while downplaying the struggles of those who disagree with her by resorting to insulting her opponent's privilege... much like TERFs love to do.  Lastly, it depresses me to even bring it up, but did you really reference _Nietzsche_ of all people? You have to 'become yourself'? I thought we were beyond this edgy teenager's infuriating idea of 'philosophy', but apparently we're still rolling around in the pile of cum Nietzsche left from masturbating to himself and declaring himself the single greatest human being who will ever exist. The guy who caught the flu one time and declared that none will ever experience suffering the way he did. The rich white German guy who couldn't get laid, and so wrote an entire thesis about how it's because he's _too_ amazing. The guy who equated himself with a holy prophet, and said the only reason people ever refute his ideas is because they're too scared to admit he's right. In fact, that strikes me as familiar; Natalie, people like Tabby aren't refusing your idea of femininity because they're 'scared of the truth' or whatever edgy, childish idea you think, they're refusing because it's not _their_ idea of femininity. It's almost as if people are individuals with their own experiences, thoughts, and feelings. Similarly, there is no amorphous entity known as 'men' who judge your womanhood, 'men' are also individuals who have different ideas of femininity, too. One man might deem you extremely feminine, while another might deem you as seeming fake, and liken you to a drag queen. Even what _you_ see as feminine doesn't appear to me as particularly feminine, for example. It's more psychological to me, rather than physical. ~It's what's on the inside, my dudette.~   I'm not even saying that your interpretation of femininity is incorrect and that you should conform to mine, which is what you seem to be saying, I'm just saying there are different interpretations out there, and that even those who judge your femininity have different interpretations, so it's literally impossible to force the entire population of transwomen to conform to society's idea of 'femininity', because I don't really think there is one. If you look at Hollywood recently, apparently 'femininity' is the act of wearing combat boots and killing people, and... I still see that as a valid expression of femininity. If that's the kind of woman you want to be, I don't really see why you shouldn't be allowed to pursue that. You'd probably be much more interesting to talk to than whatever embodiment of traditional 'womanhood' Natalie wants you to be.  It just hurts that I'm hated by the society I live in because I don't conform to my given gender, so I turn to the trans community, who then hate me because I don't conform enough to their ideal of what my preferred gender is. Now I'm in the kind of mood where I don't really know why I'm alive, but I guess Natalie would say my entire experience and everything I feel is completely irrelevant because there are people who are suffering more. That's what I get for thinking I might have finally found the one person on Earth whose views on gender I actually agree with, but I guess there's just no place for me in any form of politics.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The thing about these dialogue videos is that I'm never quite sure whose side I'm on.  The idea of gender as a performance is pretty intuitive and I liked that analogy about identifying as a doctor.  But taking that view to its logical conclusion, that means that gender is mostly about how others rate your performance in that role, so if someone feels like a woman but isn't perceived as such by others, then they don't have a solid claim to being a woman and I get why that's a problem (I hope that's a fair summary of the video; I feel like there was some nuance there that might have gone over my head).  I guess that goes into broader discussions about identity and how one's identity is mostly defined by society.  How the individual feels about the matter might be taken into consideration, but without society's validation, any claim about identity is kind of moot.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I keep watching this video and I really don't understand how it makes me feel. I am someone who has struggled a lot with gender identity and dysphoria my entire life, and witnessing these two viewpoints of gender being performative vs. not performative combat each other seemingly within the same mind made me strangely emotional, because I relate to the swirling chaos of self conflicting arguments and feelings about gender and identity within my own mind. I don't know what I am. I don't know what it means to identify as something. My dysphoria leaves me often wanting to exist in and feeling like I identify with many kinds of bodies. I have wanted to be physically more male and I often feel I need to have a female body. I find my personality very feminine. Am I metrosexual? Nonbinary? Does my sexuality have anything to do with this? I want to fuck and dominate, but also to be fucked and dominated. Do those correlate to masculine and feminine or do they both come from the same places within me? The people i'm around influence who I want to be and what parts of me i'm comfortable with. Does that mean i'm nebulous and fake? I'm sure gender is performative and socialized. I'm sure gender is a lie, a social construct that changes century to century and decade to decade. That gender roles are harmful to everyone involved, and the majority of people stray outside the societal definitions of man and women in some way. Most of the time I feel i'm sure of that. But then where does dysphoria come from? Why do I feel my body would finally fit me if it was smaller and more feminine?   This makes no sense and is a generally incoherent ramble and I'm sorry. This is an excellent video.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm having trouble understanding what is to be taken away from this video. I don't fully agree with either argument presented, i definitely stand somewhere in the middle. Aesthetics are important, and how we present is a part of how we socialize with people, but I don't see how any trans person doesn't understand these harsh truths that you are delivering. Maybe I'm too early on in my transition and i haven't met enough trans people to know any who aren't aware of the pressure of performing and 'looking the part', but honestly i just kind of feel dysphoric and dumb for not 'getting' what you're saying here","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"This video is really well done.  It brings up an interesting point, though. I'm agender--arguably, not really a social role that exists in the world. Under the 'gender is extended performance' idea, I literally wouldn't be able to be something society doesn't have a conception of, despite the fact that it is extremely real for me. There just isn't a way to say 'I am neither a man or a woman nor any other gender' in aesthetics in a way that is universally understood except to deliberately flaunt the gender binary. and that is, well...something that people who live stealth due to being financially dependent on binarist institutions like me are unable to achieve for the most part.

"As a nonbinary person, this video has convinced me that nonbinary people have no place in society and cannot be accepted, if they can be said to exist at all. I've taken a day to think about this and that's my conclusion.  For those claiming 'this is just a discussion!' It's not. It's a quiet, active deconstruction of Tabby's viewpoints with little to no similar treatment to Justine. Justine is given more time to speak, has more well rounded arguments, and there are very few times when Tabby can even touch her.   If society is a play that we all participate in, as posited here, then I cannot create a new role and have it be respected. Who I am is null and void. In the end, I'm just a lazy asshole who doesn't want to bother with the gender binary.   Contra can do what she wants, but I wish she hasn't made this video. Exploring controversial topics for the sake of it without concern for the audience is what the alt right does. This is the trans version of 'well blacks act in a certain way in society so I guess that's just how they are.' It's garbage and careless.   This video has sent me into the worst depressive spiral I've had in months. I want to die. If this video was meant to be a deconstruction of gender presentation and expectations, I've been deconstructed along with those topics, and it feels absolutely awful.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

For me, it wasn't about changing myself to fit a certain space but finding the spaces in which I'd thrive. The ones I don't thrive in don't become invalid either they are just another expression of womanhood but neither is the sole expression. The boots close some doors and open others as do the heels but those doors don't determine the person's gender, the person does. Sometimes masculine women hold the door open for feminine women and vice versa and that's where the power lies. Tabby and Justine (crap I probably forgot the chars name already) will have more power as themselves but allied together than they will if one changes and becomes the other. And at no time does one cease to be a woman. That's all fine and good until the dysphoria hits...I can only guess...","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The main point of this video (that the performance of gender is the basis of gender, and that therefore trans people should work to match that) isn't something everyone agrees on. But more importantly, it puts trans people's identities in the position of being an inherent social/political statement, and therefore whether they pass is a political/social statement.

"I'm a science teacher and the one principle I try to teach my students, above all else, is never stop seeking knowledge. I try to follow the same rule (after all, hypocrisy is the fastest way to lose one's legitimacy) and as such I have sought many 'Social Justice' channels in an attempt to understand the various perspectives found in the realm intersectionality. Some channels are extremely antagonistic, assuming the audience is either here to reinforce their already-held beliefs, or they are here to antagonize and insult the channel/creator/viewers. Sadly, this is all too often the case, so I don't blame them for the antagonism.  Suffice it to say, your channel is a breath of fresh air among so many stagnant pools of anger and loathing. You are clearly intelligent, but you don't wield that as a club against the uninformed/misinformed. I admire that. You also are willing to yield points that some creators refuse to acknowledge because they seemingly believe that either the 'left' is totally correct, or it is totally wrong, and yielding any ground would be tantamount to total surrender of their philosophy. Ironically, this attitude is the very thing that causes people to become immovable in their arguments and perspectives. The willingness to 'give-and-take' in a discussion is a mark of genuine intellectual honesty. Another rare and admirable trait.   Suffice it to say I have really enjoyed your videos, both in presentation and content. Thank you for offering a hand in cooperation to those who simply want to better understand others, not fight or troll.

Shame on you for holding conformism to a transphobic society up as the 'other side' to Tabby's arguments that you don't need to conform to be valid. And we all know Justine is a stand in for you. You've held Tabby up as a one-dimensional parody of far leftists in the past so it's obvious you don't really agree with her.  It's one thing to see yourself that way, Natalie. It's another to draw a line in the dirt between 'trutrans' people who can pass and conform and are privileged enough to be relatively safe post-transition and those who don't or can't. Shame on you. I can't imagine how much this video is going to fuck with young trans women who are already being pressured to conform or be treated like dirt.

"I honestly feel like the proper delineation between Tabby and Justine is the dichotomy of private versus political. Were I a trans woman, the way I would rectify this conflict being that if you're going to try to be a face of a movement, if you're going to willingly present yourself in front of a board of your peers to state your cases then the unfortunate truth is you do more harm than good if you're Tabby and not Justine. However, if some transphobe fuckin misgenders you to insult you while youre just trying to live your life, knock their shit in because you're not asking of anyone anything other than what everyone else wants, to be left the fuck alone to live your life free of harassment and violence in all its forms... AND if they deny you that, they surrender their as well.  It's kind of saddening and gross that this is the most reasonable answer I could personally come up with, but I think it is in fact the most reasonable.  Please note that since I am not trans in any way I am not speaking for any trans person reading this, but it might be possible a trans person might have a difficult time putting into words something similar to my statement here.

"Performing gender has always been very...back and forth with me personally.  I was sexually abused as a kid, and I hid myself under masculine clothing for a long time afterwards because I felt safer. Like I couldn't be a target because I wasn't presenting as feminine, and thus weaker. I cut my hair super short, I wore baggy pants and hoodies, and I never wore makeup. And that didn't make me appealing, and thus I was shunned for it.  Flash forward ten years, and I finally feel comfortable enough with myself to start wearing skirts and growing my hair out and I was in *tears* the first time I put on a long skirt again because it felt so RIGHT and it made me so happy that I could feel comfortable with that again and I felt like I had reclaimed that for myself, because I always loved pink and princesses and all that girly shit, but I finally felt strong enough to let it all out without feeling like I could be weaker for it.  Which opened up a whole new can of worms when I realized I don't really identify as female. I still love to present as feminine, but that always felt... *wrong* in the face of androgyny being the preferred presentation for non-binary, agender people like myself. Doubly so because I'm a chubby bitch and I got a soft bod with what could be called 'feminine' curves. (That I also took years to love and accept and regain my own self-confidence, but that's another story.)  I seem 'too feminine' to be non-binary, and I still struggle with that to this day, especially because I'm AFAB. It feels like cheating sometimes. Like I'm cis passing, and I don't want to take hormones or anything, I just identify as agender, and like to be feminine but it feels like I can't do that because then I'm not androgynous enough for the queers and just butch enough to be hated by the cishets for stepping out of the Girl Box because I don't feel the need to shave my legs or perform femininity for the sake of pleasing cishet bro boners.  I guess that's why I lean so heavily into ultra-feminine stuff like Lolita fashion, because it's feminine for the sake of being feminine, and not for the performative pleasure of dudes (though y'all know that cishet dudes will pop a boner at a slight breeze, so damned if I do and damned if I don't I suppose).  At this point I'm just like 'fuck it, I'll do what I want'.  Also, I missed my glorious queen (in a cat way, not in a monarchy way) Tabby.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I feel this is weakened by having Tabby refer not to a materialist account of the enforcement of gender but an extremely liberal model of 'inner truth' and free floating identity. It's especially odd since you have Tabby say the other character (I forget her name) can't account for where trans subjectivity comes from, but leaves herself open to the very same critique of her appeal to 'identity'. Perhaps it serves the needs of the skit, but it kind of limits it to a false dichotomy: a shallow liberal feminism against a shallow reading of Butler. And sure, that's pretty much the state of the 'trans discourse' right now, but let's point beyond it?  To state the point briefly, trans women are made women by the kinds of violence we are subject to, and the kinds of labour we are relegated to perform. That doesn't provide an etiology of transness (and I don't want one) but does point to the functioning of the logic of transmisogyny as a kind of regulatory violence, release valve for the tensions of gendered society, and means to produce a class of abject, disposable people. Though the monstrous figure of the trans woman as horrifying false woman/failed man drives this, it does not exclusively affect out trans women, and can hit us long before we reach the point of articulating womanhood or nonbinariness in our own terms.  You sneer at the 'Tumblr hugbox' in this video, which is a shame, because the debates on that platform - often quite vicious - have gone a long way to hammering out something resembling an adequate theory.  These theoretical points aside, I think the odd thing about the role of Tabby here is that she's clearly very concerned with aesthetics. She wears cat ears! She's playing to an aesthetic norm just as much as the other character, it's just not the norm of talk shows. So her arguments of not caring about aesthetics, and just being true to herself, ring rather hollow.  The biggest limitation, though, is that when Tabby is challenged on referring to oppressive dynamics that don't apply to her, no effort is made by either party to engage with the exclusion from the conversation of anyone but two thin white women. Like, that's part of the limitation of the format I guess, you can only show characters you can perform yourself, but the problem is not 'should white women try to be more respectable' but how to combat the mechanisms that make this a white women's conversation! And the problem with the 'use your privilege' argument taken to mean 'play the part of a presentable middle class white woman on tv' is that we're not just trying to secure liberation for presentable middle class white women, and this is at best all this tactic can achieve. Yes, pay attention to optics, but that doesn't mean regurgitating uncritically the limited narratives we're permitted to present.  Which is to say, it's all spectacle etc. The narratives of trans women on TV are far more in the hands of the producer looking for ratings, and without an enormous amount of care that most of us aren't capable of, it's better to refuse the stage than agree to a rigged 'debate' on whether we deserve to exist (which is to say, on how miserable our existence should be). Should we take the advice, and present respectably, not rise to provocation, etc., we are at the mercy of the other horn of the dilemma: we are caricatures of womanhood etc., or at best get gish galloped into irrelevance. This video makes out, at least in one of the 'contraposed points' (:p), that the problem is insufficiently respectable trans women, not the system that works to centre images of trans women as a chimera of pathetic faggots/violent monsters.  Basically, it is absurd to imagine that all the cause of trans liberation needs is more beautiful white women public figures, and that the only alternative is to performatively threaten people with violence. Neither image will 'work'. Our liberation will not be won in TV debates or through the right public figures.  And ok, that's enough for a comment that is unlikely to be read by anyone...","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I believe I understand the argument that gender can be disassociated from Sex because gender only exists as the reality of whom recognizes it, thus the comparison to a doctor is only really a doctor if everyone recognizes him or her as such. This leads into why 'passing' as a woman for a trans person is so important because they must overcome the barrier of their Sex to legitimize their gender identity. It's also why someone calling the Cat-person (I'm confused actually what this character represents) a man has such power: because the only thing making CatPerson a woman is everyone recognizing CatPerson as one.  The rebuttal is where my question comes though. Both characters affirm eachother as women despite being Sexually males. However, wouldn't the value of this entirely depend upon a shared value of Humanism whereby the individual's uniqueness has a right to protection/existence in society and the individuals are the ultimate arbiters of norms and morality? I raise this question because if the basis for affirming trans identity rests on the humanist premise, then it would be open to the same criticisms humanism at large would be. Namely: an inability to make universal statements of truth.  Please respond if I don't understand the argument clearly.   PS: I do enjoy the format of the debating characters, especially as they contest each other's arguments, but the role of the third Diva character was beyond me.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Maybe these opposing views on gender are correct in a dialectic sense. As a nonbinary pansexual, gender has never been anything but a performance to me. I see no inherent meaning or truth to it. Yet I realize it's extremely meaningful to everyone else, and as long as we as a society regard a concept as 'true' it becomes part of reality and should be handled as such. The latter is not just true for the concept of gender itself, but also for a preference for specific iterations of it. So I get why Justine is not as popular as Tabby, but they both have sound arguments I think.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Gender is an identity, sex is not. Sex is physical, you can reproduce with a womb, and a female egg, and this requires a male to do so, this is important - this is how the sexes are defined literally behind the many coloured glasses that we have. And no amount of abuse or psychological reconditioning can undo this, it is reality. The only solution is that since the sexes are physically definitive, as in we can technically break down the bodily differences that include even all of the information in the sex differentiated chromosomes, that the body can be fully changed. The problem for transgendered women is two; one that many transgender women merely identify as a woman, hence they do not want sex reassignment surgery. The second is that true sex change does not yet exist. Those who change sex do not have true female genitals, wombs do not exist for this process yet, they will never be able to give birth until this is a reality. And their chromosomes have not changed.  Though it is arguable whether changing chromosomes is truly so important to the process, you may be able to have all the sex characteristics of the opposite gender, working genitals, hormone therapy, etc, without really touching on any of the male or female chromosomes. Though,  that word again, even changing entire chromosomes is not unrealistic. We're getting pretty good at changing the genes of living things. How long do you think that would take to become a reality for us? I'm optimistic. And call me shallow, but the riddle of human mortality was more important to me that getting a more legit vaginal implant.  Why would I be affected by my sex so much if I knew that time is the only thing working against me? I'd rather spend my time thinking of how to live for a few more hundred years, or even more arrogantly, a lot longer than that. If you can do that, all your dreams follow. You will have all the time in the world to completely change sex. It will be an age where our physical differences are choices, superficial, being male, or female, will become blurry, and less meaningful. You can be anything that you desire, you can reproduce any way, with better results than natural selection could ever give you.  What happens then? Will people freely swap their sex in their hundreds of year lives to explore all reality has to offer? Will being a woman, or a man, become merely a phase in their long life? These things put into question our values toward these ideals.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'I can identify as a doctor and go around handing out diagnoses, but if no one recognizes me as a doctor then I'm not really practicing medicine, am I?',   So...I realize this is pretty much a throwaway line used for rhetorical effect, but it's a bit troubling to me because it reinforces the misconception of (Western) medical practice as an exclusively professional domain - which is not only ahistorical, but erases the lived experience and labour of many chronic patients.  This reframing of medicine, which has largely taken place over the last 200-300 years, neglects the integral and often cooperative roles that have been played by empiric, magico-religious, community and self-healers since the Middle Ages - to the point that patients engaging with practices of self-medicine within digital contexts are regularly represented as an entirely new phenomenon, rather than part of a continuous history of medicine as a system of diverse and loosely integrated practices.   Conversely, medical historians and postmodern philosophers of medicine - when they bother to address patient roles at all - tend to approach patients since modernity as passive objects lacking entirely in agency since 'their self-perceptions are themselves medically contaminated' - but again, this is inaccurate because it ignores the widespread and largely invisible labour of self-medicine that has always been a crucial part of chronic patienthood. (I think it's also worth considering how defining medicine-in-practice in professional terms erases its inherently social and interactional nature - regardless of whether they engage in community- or self-diagnosis and treatment, patients are nonethless practitioners of medicine.)   Sorry - this feels like kind of a trivial nitpick, but given the nebulous nature of this dialogue and the ways in which disabled perspectives are often rendered invisible in a lot of leftist discourse and philosophy, it feels important to me to call attention to the fact that practices of medicine are similarly not nearly as cut-and-dried as they're often represented, and as they seem to be represented here.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i am a cis lesbian and this a video that seems pretty intracommunity, but i want to say that, at least for me, i think womanhood is a trap for everyone involved. the efforts required to be 'successfully' feminine are beyond me. i can see every day what other women are doing that i am not, and it looks effortless and alluring and often attractive, and i'm torn between being happy for them and this yearning to perform femininity to that extent. i'm definitely not gnc, but i feel as though i'm failing to be 'good' at being feminine. there are certain feminine trappings for every kind of style from the ultra femme glam makeup efforts to the 'i rolled out of bed with sweatpants' and i don't feel as though i fit into any of them well. i just feel fat and ugly and although i would like to be more 'successfully' feminine, focusing on my features long enough to put on makeup or try on close just makes me hate myself even more and feeds my dysmorphia. it's a constant thing i deal with and while i do feel as though i'm a woman, i don't fit comfortable in nonbinary conceptions of identity, and i'm definitely not a trans guy, i just... feel like a failed woman. and i feel like it all the time. i don't know if it's relevant but it's true, and i think it's the result of womanhood as a social category emphasizing the aesthetics of women's appearances. it's a struggle every day.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The epoch of Athene philosophers was also the time of the development of the classsical greek style. Sure it expanded later on with the hellenistic style , but so did philosophy. When christianity solidified in terms of thinkers and conservation of knowledge, christian art became more elaborate as well. The renaissance is a time of thinkers and artists. Aesthetics are enlightenment. The reality is more a back and forth of minimalism and extravagance (classical greek and hellenistic, early renaissance and mannerism, classical and baroque, hippie and punk etc...

There are times and places when those of us privileged with the option need to pass. For our safety. For political impact.  Then, there are times and places when highlighting our difference is a more powerful option.

When we can do more by scaring the horses than by calming them.

All she's arguing for is acquiescing to the unfair expectations that the rest of the trans rights movement is fighting against, because many of us literally can't fulfill them.  She's succeeded in becoming one of the 'good ones,' and she argues the rest of us should try to do the same. But that isn't how progress is made.

"Natalie, I sincerely hope you don't agree with Justine. Her views are absolutely abhorrent and wrong, and you're BETTER than views like those. SO much better. Your videos taught me that we can examine all the messy and complicated facts of a situation, open-mindedly and with nuance, and STILL take a hard stance in favor of what's right, and in favor of changing the world for the better. I could be misinterpreting things, but it seems like this video is saying, instead, that we might as well resign ourselves to the fact that the world is a horrible place that judges people by how they look and treats GNC people badly so we might as well just go along with it because we have no hope of changing it. But that's not true. We DO. At least from what I've seen, the world has already become more accepting of GNC people than it was when I was in high school 10 years ago. Everyday at my job, I see groups of teenagers come in, groups including not only conventional-looking girls and guys, but also effeminate dudes, butch girls, and possible nonbinary kids---all laughing together and clearly supporting each other as friends. I know there's still a long way to go, but we can do this. We're not doomed to live in a shallow, judgmental world forever. We can change, we should change, and we already are changing.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"A few years ago one of my best friends from hs transitioned from m2f. I always was there for her, when her family life was getting difficult she lived with my family, I always accepted her for who she was and we spoke as much as she was comfortable with speaking about her transitioning. She moved away not too long after that and we still speak. The reason I bring this up is because I had a genuine want to know more but during her transition, didn't want to berate her with my questions (really, I wouldn't want to bother someone with my questions if they weren't comfortable with bringing it up themselves) knowing how difficult initial transitioning is. So as a straight (brown) male these videos give me such a deep look at one person's perspective and experience as a trans woman, and helps me understand the struggle and real threats society aims at trans people. I don't want to ever sound like I'm patronizing but it makes me feel proud to stand for trans. Thank you, Natalie you're the best!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

He's one of THOSE people who feel the need to constantly denigrate everyone else. It's likely nothing legal can ever make him stop, unfortunately... Sad. On a side note of that, am I the only person who thought Jenner's threat there wasn't particularly masculine? The way it was phrased, the body language, it all felt feminine, like a mom who's had enough of this shit. A more masculine way to threaten would be 'say that again, to my fist' or just straight up attacking him there. Instead, she pulled a 'keep that up and you'll be going home in an ambulance,' which is like, the most motherly way of threatening someone I can think of.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I love this (self) argument. On the one hand, in a perfect world, I would fully support the cat-girl character. People should just be whoever they are. This also means that the belief in surgery or HRT being necessary components of someone's life would hold about as much value as getting a boob job or face list. We don't live in a perfect world, however, and the subterfuge and need to be something that society will accept and validate is always present. This is true for everyone and we all go out of our way to conform to the aesthetic demands of society (regardless of trans or cis status)... so the uh... more feminine one has the strongest point.  BTW, this is also the exact point that Jordan Peterson is regularly bashed for making. The world exists whether you like it or not and if you go against the grain, you should expect society to isolate, exclude, and treat you like an outsider or less than human.

"'The world we live in is not a philosophical world.  Lemme illustrate this with the least related piece of pop culture possible:  The rap beef between MGK and Eminem. Who won and why? What matters more, content or presentation?  It started on twitter like 6 years ago. 'Machine Gun Kelly' had an 'its just a joke man!' Moment at Eminem's expense. Was he joking? Nobody really knows, but Marshall Mathers took this up through his media connections, allegedly getting MGK's album deal pulled over a comment about Mathers' daughter 'made in jest'.  Okay. Fast forward to like two weeks ago. Eminem drops an album calling out every rapper that he's ever had any hint of a problem with. 45 year old white boys apparently like starting fights.  MGK had a bit of a spotlight for most of a song. It was probably the worst put together song that Eminem has ever done. The flow was janky, the beat was cacaphonic, and to top it off, Eminem leaves himself open to serious correction.  Days later (not years)/MGK responds with his *best put together song ever*, Rap Devil. It calls out Eminem about factual inaccuracies, laying out the embarassing facts of the beef, attacking Eminem's lifestyle as that of an irresponsible father, and more braggadocio. This mumble rapper suddenly can flow.  Days later, Eminem responds with Killshot - a fast paced, fame-bragging, mischaracterizing assault positively built on a foundation of insincere threats of violence. But holy shit that flow was amazing. Eminem should take Machine gun Kelly's name, the way this fast paced diss rap just cuts at MGK... The beat? Is just the beat for rap devil played backwards.  Who then responds with *Legshot* - so named because of Eminem's perfect aim in 'Killshot' at a freaking strawman. Guess who's flow is janky, off kilter now? Laying down honesty, pointing out the fallacies, and coming back with what amounts to 'yeah, youre not gonna do shit' while slinging his own bravado and empty threats of violence, MGK fired back.  No matter how much MGK actually had the truth on his side in the music... He fell short musically. In the pretend violent world of world-class white boy rap, Eminem's ability to flow simply outclassed the upstart.   And having Fallout boy fans pose for his pic (MGK was the opening act) without telling them why? Only made *them* angry, and point out the dishonesty to the rest of the public. He got booed off stage.  So now, in trying to appear to have more support, MGK just shot his own leg. The mumble rapper seems to have put himself down.  See how very little of this has to do with Truth directly, but more *The Perception of Truth*, and how much more with Presentation? Quite literally the entire world is judging over Youtube.  But seriously - Donald Trump is President, and the greatest rapper *Ever* is apparently Eminem, and he just defended that title against a goddamned Mumble Rapper *with a fucking strawman*.  *If God is dead, then truth is on life support, moving to hospice care next week*.  Now I wanna see Snoop Dogg battle rap against Kanye.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's always interesting to watch binary trans folks hashing out identity v aesthetics, because gender is very centered in performance, for me, but as a nonbinary AFAB person who hasn't medically transitioned, my ideal performance of gender only appears transgressive when performed by people who look like men.  My femme impulses are just read as womanhood, which makes me dysphoric, because my internal reality isn't recognized by external society.  So, like, I'm technically safer, because I 'pass' as a cis woman, but that act of passing makes my dysphoria worse.  I want to be seen as gender-nonconforming, but for an AFAB person, that is implied to mean masculinity.  All my gender icons are pretty men or transfeminine; Caleb Landry Jones, Jackie Curtis, Count D from Pet Shop of Horrors.  So yeah, I feel this video a lot.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"What came to mind watching this is, that for a transman, performing manhood is always about taking action rather than aesthetics. The discrepansy between who I am and who I perform being only becomes obvious after I've taken certain actions, such as chanting out loud at a bar, taking charge or pretending to care about sports. The oddness for me then comes with the fact that I to begin with wanted to flee performed femininity, but when I now project feminine characteristics (by wearing make-up or being flamboyant) I feel at ease somehow, because it's no longer needed for me to do it, rather, it's an option - now that I am male, femininity does not negate my maleness, in the same way as maleness negates femininity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hi, very interesting video as always.  I'd just like to say that this whole argument of internal experience vs. the aesthetic of passing completely ignores and sidelines nonbinary folx, who being not conforming to the gender binary by definition can't 'pass'; society has no pre-defined role for someone who isn't a man or a woman, and thus one can't really perform such an aesthetic. So though Butler's idea of gender as performative is useful, it's not complete. One cannot perform a nonbinary gender except through noncomformance to the binary genders, which in its nature is an act outside of the norms of society which defines gender.   I know you're talking here from your own experience of (I assume) a binary trans woman, but the way your debate is framed really erases the experience of nonbinary people, which indicates a shortcoming in the theoretical framework you've presented.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I've been subscribed to Contrapoints for some years now, and I think it might be one of the first time I regretted watching a video. Of course, it might just be the specific headspace I've been in these past few days, but that video left me rather... well, I suppose sad, but not exactly so. Now, the video was very well produced and a good dialogue for the most part. However, the overall tone feels a lot more melancholic than Natalie's other videos. There seems to be an air of resignation which lingers over the entire thing. Tabby is presented as being the sole representative of a community which is otherwise non-existent while Justine, who has by far the more pessimistic view, is presented as being mostly overwhelming and omnipresent. It feels as though the result is a dichotomy between martyrdom and self-erasure where middle-ground or change isn't achievable. I also find it difficult to accept Justine's point of view as tolerable when it, according to Tabby, involves her mocking Tabby behind her back. Adopting a socially friendly appearance and demeanor is one thing but using marginalized people as a way to prompt yourself up is just downright awful.  These issues are only compounded by the sour ending of the conversation where the two of them watch what I take to be a representation of the current climate, at least the one on the internet. I do agree that it is bad, but to focus solely on the Justine side of the issue makes the situation look absolutely hopeless. It seemed as though the final message was that things are terrible and they will always be terrible and the only way out is to adopt a veneer of conformity, that is if adopting said veneer is even possible.  Normally, I wouldn't mind a bitter video, but I fear that it might send a very negative message to questioning people, those early in their transition, and the non-passing people. And, I think that of anyone, these people aren't really in need a negative outlook given how they probably experience most of what is described here. Anyways, those were just my thoughts. I guess putting them on paper helped me some.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I understand that this video is about a trans experience, and I don't seek to derail that. It brings to mind, though, how much 'act more feminine and you'll be discriminated against less' is, to lesser degrees, a huge issue for all sorts of marginalized women. When lesbianism, fatness, blackness are 'unfeminine', how do gay, fat, and Black trans women even achieve that acceptance? And when femininity is being quiet, submissive, and agreeable, as it often is, how are trans women (or other marginalized women) ever meant to do anything with the relative power they can achieve through optics? Both characters in the video have great points and bad points, as I'm sure was the point. But it's a hard conversation to hear without getting defensive, for myself and probably for a lot of marginalized women.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I loved this video, but may I humbly add a thought I had? While acting and looking ultra feminine like Justine garners acceptance from society at large, being contrary to that also garners a certain recognition from society. Being a tabby makes society reject you, but is this truly a negative when the result is expected? Why not be a Daria instead of a Quinn? Not caring how you look IS a look too. It conveys, inevitably, a message of Independence, when rebelliousness. And there is power in that too, I think. Perhaps we got this wrong, and there is a space for both Justine and Tabby. What I don't get, and perhaps that's the point, is how acutely aesthetic Tabby is, how aesthetic being on the fringe is. If aesthetic is the expression of the self, it means it needs an audience, it's defined by the expectator, society, but also by the performer. Thus identity is the wish to perform? I think?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think dissociating aesthetics from womanhood further proves the ambiguity of the identity, which further complicates the demand to be 'treated as a woman'.  In other words, if we go with Kitty's (is that her name?) idea, then we should accept her as a woman merely because that's what she wants, not because she performs in any way that is inherently womanly. In other words, the necessary and sufficient condition for womanhood is self-identification as such, in her view. But how does this fit into any sort of political demand for equal treatment of women, or an private demand of a particular individual to be more respectful to Kitty as a woman? Kitty will inevitably have different standards than Justine for what it means to be respected as a woman, no?  And if the point I'm making sounds like bullshit because 'it shouldn't be that hard, Jordan, to just respect a woman', then I feel like you're indirectly RELYING on aesthetics to make your case. The only way it could be obvious to me is if I rely on some intuitive sense of what is universally womanly. Where could such a sense come from if not an aesthetic vantage? Basically, I don't think we can escape aesthetics. I think the reliance on the idea of womanhood is a placeholder for a more sophisticated strata of identification, and that eventually there will be a normalized sense of experimentation, self-exploration, and self-discovery, that will allow room for somebody like Kitty to transcend the need for 'womanhood' and own a more specialized, personalized term or set of terms for her identity, one that fits with her aesthetic. So, I'm saying that aesthetics are unavoidable, but that that is ultimately a great thing about humanity, and it is being taken advantage of by the perceived gender binary. This abuse forces people like Kitty to try to fit into the binary by relying on one of its two labels while also combating the binary by heralding self-identification. I don't know the way out of such a system, so I don't blame Kitty for inadvertently perpetuating it, but I'm not sure that her strategy is really what will liberate humanity. Did this make sense?

"I understand the politics of passing are uncomfortable, and that Justine and Tabby are fallible characters, but it hurts to see a near defeatist POV prioritized while issues of monetary access and nonbinary folks are glossed over. I love Dr. Butler's work, but it also needs to be said that there are a host of other activists and academics who have conflicting theories on gender and performativity in particular. I know that Nat is focusing on trans women, and as a trans man a lot of this resonates, but even though this is presented as kind of ? a debate ? it feels like there's still some nuance that's missing. I disagree heartily with Justine, and don't think she's right, but the presentation makes it seem like Justine is ultimately right. I think she makes some good points about practicality, but passing shouldn't be the only priority, especially when we can focus on normalizing and accepting GNC folks, cis or trans.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I kind of get what you could be going for with this, but it came off as pretty alienating. There's an imbalance of respectability with the two characters and Justine seemed to say more overall. The point of accepting and then putting aside their differences was weak and felt too late.   I understand very well that one can't expect others to give a damn, and the only person that can change how others see you is yourself, but some trans folks have it much harder than being able to pass with a couple hours of makeup and dressing the right way. Some, no matter what they do, won't 'pass' without spending money (that they don't have, so can't spend), and even with surgeries some won't 'make it'.   Maybe this video will motivate some people to try harder and they'll see some positive results in their lives, but I've always felt the idea of being a 'Good Trans' is very insidious and harmful. I wouldn't blame anyone for learning to pass and leaving this struggle behind, but it's not an achievable goal for many of us.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Gotta be honest, I have several criticisms of this video. I know trans people have to try extremely hard to pass, but you shouldn't have to follow gender stereotypes to pass. I know society at large will be more accepting of trans people if they do, but fuck that. A person shouldn't have to adhere to gender roles to justify their identity. And if other people don't accept a person's identity, it's the people's fault, not the individual's presentation of their identity. Don't pander to people who are skeptical of a person's gender identity. Act however the fuck you want, and if people don't accept your identity, that's their problem, not yours. Somethings are more important than optics.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I make sure to present as a version of me. How ever fancy or casual my clothes or make up is. They are tools I can use to appear how I want to, depending on who I'm going to see  And if I choose to not use them most days. That decison is an informed one, being aware of what I am or am not doing when I leave the house.  Now, I get a pass on being called out on that. Being a cis woman. I understand that too.

"Not exactly the same but my attempt at relating: As someone that has finally in my late thirtees come to terms with the fact that I have autism I to a very high degree have stopped to try and _pass_ for neurotypical. I can impossibly fit into this world built by and for neurotypicals so why bother trying? Luckily for me autism is relatively invisible on a surface level which means I _can_ pass for 'quiet loner' by sitting down and shutting the hell up but I don't really see why I have to, and frankly I don't want to.  Sure this makes me socially shunned and I have never been able to keep a regular job - but living the lie, using up all of the little energy I have at my disposal acting like I am expected to just plunges me into depression over and over again. Conforming to me is prison of drainage and belonging to any kind of group has never been a thing for me. Perhaps I can only understand it on a theoretical level; I have never felt it or even felt the urge for it other than under the threat of violence (see grade school). I am done with it.  I understand that very few people is in a position where they can cut out both social functions and work in a traditional sense so, while I will most probably feel alienated from society all my life, forever battling the depression it imposes on you, I feel lucky in that I am privilegied enough to be able to live expressing this level of honesty right now. While making a living is immensely difficult I am however certain that no-one will try to kill me for a having a sensory overload-related meltdown in a busy supermarket.  Wow, that became a really tldr way of saying, I sympathize and thanks for the video; autism + coffee does that sometimes. xo","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Soft Butch transwoman here. When I decided to not kill myself and instead transition 10 years ago, I tried a lot of dumb stuff in the beginning. Including forcing myself to be into men (therapists were more regressive back then) to appease. Looking a certain way to appease. But it made me unhappy beyond belief. I didn't want to come out of the closet, just to step into the next one. I knew appeasement would have to stop, if I ever want to be myself and live my life how I want it to live. And life started to get better again. But then I'm a queer woman, and straight transwomen will have it even harder to live among the straight dudes. But I can't do that anymore, I'll not live on my knees to appease the oppressors.

"I don't think either Justine or Tabby or meant to be 'right.' I think they are thesis and antithesis, a sort of debate between two wrong extremes and we're meant to puzzle out the truth from the union of the two, like mixing the two flasks at the beginning.  My take, Justine is right in that we live in an age of spectacle. We have to live in that reality. Tabby is right that it is unjust and it is important to recognize that that is unjust. Its not the best idea to threaten Ben Shapiro or TERFs even if they deserve it.  At the risk of going outside my lane, this is not entirely different from debates between folks like WEB Dubois and Booker T. Washington about living as a black person and navigating a world where your oppressors set the terms and the framing.  Or more of a pop culture reference, its like the debate between Magneto and Professor X.  I think Magneto and Tabby are very seductive and channel the completely justified and necessary wrath but it has to be tempered with the understanding that the whole affair is theater, a circus. Tabby is necessary but it uses credibility. Justine is necessary too. Justine builds credibility that tabby can use. A dark knight and a white night. Combat boots and heels. Guns and Ammo.

"As a cis gendered woman, this video does make me realize the real privilege I live with. I've never been a tomboy - I've never gone out of my way to be masculine or pursue a stereotypically masculine profession. But I've rarely put any effort into being feminine either, aside from removing facial hair once a week or two. I hardly ever wear makeup, I don't like wearing skirts or dresses much, I don't own any leggings,  and I tend to wear neutral or masculine-ish clothes, some of which are hand-me-downs from my boyfriend, who favours athletic wear. And yet I can take for granted that my womanhood will be recognized - that I'm very unlikely to be mistaken for a man in person (thanks to XX chromosomes,  a pituitary gland and sex organs that did all the legwork without me having to worry about it much at all), or on paper for that matter (thanks to my obviously feminine name, given to me by my parents). And if someone calls me 'sir' on the phone because my voice might be a bit low, it's something I can just laugh off. I can afford not to worry about, view it as a threat, or feel a stab at my identity. All of that is the privilege of being a cis woman in society.  I'm glad to see videos like this. Although they're certainly not intended for my 'cis-y' benefit,  they make me realize how thin of a ledge a trans woman might feel like they're balancing on. I feel like Tabby should be right in a just world, but Justine knows the world is not just at all. As long as cisgender norms continue to dominate, a trans woman may feel compelled to not only perform womanhood, but to over-perform, to be The Woman, hoping to escape the fear that all the effort to transition will somehow be Sisyphean (cis-y-fee-in?). At least, that's as far as I can see. I cannot really know the true struggle of being trans, of transitioning, in a world largely hostile to such an existence, to such efforts.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Don't know what exactly, but something made me start to listen (surprisingly enough, Caitlyn Jenner appears to have been a factor in all that...). And quite frankly, I'm still learning, trying to educate myself, listening and trying to simply be a better person and not an angry tantrum driven kid like I used to be.  So thanks in part to your videos (I've been watching a lot of them lately) I get a better understanding of what 'transgender' means and why the behaviour I had was the wrong one, and not just on a surface level.

"There are two underlying factors that I believe are being neglected or glossed over in this discussion:  genetic advantage and socio-economic privilege.  Genetic makeup plays a big part in whether or not a person has attractive features (sure some aspects of attractiveness can be subjective, but let's be honest, there are definitely objective biological factors rooted in what we find attractive).  So if you win the genetic lottery--so to speak--and have features that are in line with what is considered aesthetically pleasing (tall, slim/skinny, pleasant facial structure, healthy, etc.) then you will have a much better chance of being judged favorably and accepted by society, regardless of what gender you identify/present as.  As for the economic factor, if you don't have the looks but you have wealth and privilege, you can use those resources to 'enhance' yourself in ways that help make up for whatever may be lacking.  Of course, if you have both a genetic and economic advantage, then you have the means to forge your way in society without question.  If you don't have that genetic or economic privilege, though, then you have a much more difficult time being accepted no matter what gender you consider yourself.  Most truly passable trans women were lucky enough to have a running start with the ideal genetic material, and thus would be considered aesthetically pleasing as male or female (just look at before and after photos).  Many of them also had the economic resources to not only follow through with an expensive transition process, but to also maintain their aesthetic on a constant basis.  But people will gloss over this truth and instead choose to promote the false ideal of 'you could have what I have, you just have to work for it'.  Well, many people don't have the naturally good looks, or the means to pay for expensive treatments and operations, or the never-ending supply of high-quality makeup needed to pull off a look at the level of what CP does in these videos.  It is disingenuous to have such lofty debates on aesthetics and gender perception in society without acknowledging the under-lying realities of certain biological and socio-economic privileges, of which most people have little-to-no control over.  FWIW: Despite this criticism, I thoroughly enjoyed the video and it addressed many points that have been bouncing around in my mind recently.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I really like this video cause it's showing me that I'm sliding away from Tabby's pov and more towards Justine's. I'm a black genderqueer guy who's been performing 'white' femininity my whole damn life. Hightening my naturally deep voice, shaving my facial hair, learning to hide my hair under makeup, all things I had to do to exist undisturbed as a black female teenager, and now that I'm on hrt I legit have no idea how masculinity is performed.   Gender is a performance for me, always has been and always will be so long as the constructs of what gender is are based on perception. I'm not going to go all truscumy like Justine and demand other non conforming trans ppl to assimilate, but I'm also not really appreciating the idea that perception and performance have nothing to do with how gender is constructed. Because that's how I construct what gender is (my gender not so much other ppl's).  Anyway this video made me sad that I wasn't raised a guy so I knew how to perform black masculinity as I'm transitioning right now, but this was also very illuminating to my own internal struggles that I didn't know I had.

"Are the 'cis man living as a trans woman' and 'straight man living as a gay man' examples that ridiculous though? There were many women throughout history who pretended to be men, full time, in order to be allowed more. If they were considered men for most of their lives, by almost everyone around them, does that mean they were trans men even if they personally identified as women? And this may be more of a stretch, but what about a male prostitute?

I don't think I can tell anybody who THEY are better than they can, so even in a completely hypothetical universe where attack helicopter is a common gender identity, why would I suddenly gain that insight? I suppose it's become such well-known rhetoric at this point that if it suddenly started happening frequently, I could make a case for having entered some sort of transphobic matrix.

"'Sir' is a term that refers to nobles and the thanes. Referring to a commoner as though they are a blue blood is treason in countries ruled over by a monarch. While in Canada, such a law is not enforced--treason is committed regularly up here as a side effect. The law is based upon the notion you should just know who the local blue bloods are.  When I get sir'd I remind people that I am a commoner and not a blue blood--and I will not take part in this treason. Though... I have recently been informed there is a chance my Grandfather on my dad's side MIGHT have gotten to an officers rank in the British Airforce... so... I might not be able to do that as much. I still do not think it is enough to have me being a blue blood and thus able to be called 'sir' or 'dame'... but that doubt has opened room to have people suggest that I am a blue blood... and it is irritating.  I would suggest that Tabby (who looks extremely feminine as far as I'm concerned... but like... the AWESOME women I've known) look into how sir has connections to suggesting a noble rank, and the systems that recognising blue blood would enforce and go THAT angle. I mean... it is technically treason to sir somebody in Canada, Australia, the UK, Ireland, Scotland, etc... it... it just is not enforced (unless it is the local ruling monarch--only they can sir somebody--and at that point the person sir'd would become a blue blood).","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"GUYS! STOP IT! sorry GENDER NON-SPECIFIC GUYS! STOP IT! I have no business telling individual trans people how to present themselves or pursue acceptance, but all I want to do is burst out singing 'Cat girl, you don't need to put on those high heels!'. We don't need to be accepted by the majority of people. A lot of political action can be accomplished just by appealing to fringe radicals; that was the main lesson of the past couple years. Tabby is the one who speaks to fringe radicals, so she's going to get further. This is war; we can't waste our time trying to pander to those who never will accept us. You do that, next thing you know, creepy MRAs are going to be holding trans women above cis women because they're the only ones satisfactorily complying with their ideals of femininity. If you allow for that kind of culture, it will never invalidate your gender identity, but it is shitty and against girl code. All we can do is recognize that each of us has the prerogative to seize power and enforce our own vision of morality. That's the only philosophy I think can exist, in the long run. And we just have to cross our fingers that the moral code that prevails isn't bigoted.  So I guess I side with Tabby. Heels and make up are a perfectly fine way to express femininity if that's just the kind of girl you are. But if you try to make it about fitting in for acceptance, you're being complacent with the patriarchy. I get that you don't want to get murdered, but neither did those girls who couldn't (/didn't want to) doll herself up. If you ask me, rule #1 of what it means to be a woman is that you don't sell out your sisters.  Then again I became a cam girl just to pay rent, so... stones... glass houses... Really, my answer to this question is my answer to any question of praxis: 'STOP BICKERING ABOUT HYPOTHETICALs. We all know transphobia is wrong, so this is clearly not a question of 'should' but 'can'. In which case, just assemble a team of game theorists, economists, political scientists, and military scientists. And run the numbers to estimate the least amount of pandering to centrism necessary for victory. It's not about feels. It's not about reals. Power is a numbers game. Do the math before tearing your hair out trying to guess which is the best strategy to play'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I don't know what this will or won't add to the conversation but i guess i finally feel i should type it out. I started watching you in early August this year and i can't remember what the first video i watched was called but it was a couple months old, i believe you had pretty recently started your transition.   What confused me and made my unsettled for the first half of it at least was that i couldn't determine your gender. When you walked you walked much like a man but there were sudden 'feminine' movements. You sounded both as a man and woman at the same time, your face 'looked' feminine but 'was' that of a man.   I have Asperberger's among other things and can't tell people apart. So i rely on general observations off movement and unconscious behavior to help determine who a person is and what gender they are. That was why i noticed the discrepancies in you and also why it unsettled me - i had never encountered someone who was someone and no one at the same time, who was neither a man or a woman yet both.  Somewhere around the middle of the video you casually mentioned that you where Trans and suddenly things started making more sense. Ever since you have slowly moved more and more to the feminine side and it gets harder to tell that you're biologically a man. The most notable giveaway has always been your neck/shoulder bones. Men and women have a rather significant different in the construction of their shoulder/neck bones and yours have been particular notable, maybe because it's such a stark contrast to the image you present.  However i'm 'pleased' (?) to announce that in today's video that wasn't evident anymore! +1 feminine point for you or something! It has, and still is, quite enjoyable to see you grow and evolve to be and feel less 'man' for each video.   Again i don't know what i want to say with this but now i've said it i guess? Despite how this might seem i harbor no ill intent against you or anyone else in the same situation. Whelp that's enough rambling for now - aretgagegretghbtrjhtry!

If you're a spokesperson/public figure then I could see the point of trying to please everyone, no matter how closed minded and ignorant they are. As a private individual who isn't answering to stockholders or fans, looks should only be a personal expression.  Actions are more important than subjective attractiveness. One good friend/partner is more useful than acceptance from a group of strangers. Humans crave acceptance (social media is a prime example) but people can rise beyond their genetics and be whoever and whatever they want. Hard work and passion for your goals is what separates the weak and strong minded.  TLDR: Real recognizes real and quality>quantity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think you put too much emphasis on your looks when it comes to the Blaire Watson-debate. You looked just fine too me back then. A lot of people dress weird or have a weird avatar. That's part of your charm. You could perform as the most feminine being in existence (which you are <3) but it would be boring to watch if you would do it all the time. Being different can be fun. I think it's more about what others want to see in you, not what you want to represent. If the others see Blaire as the winner of the debate, they will still see it this way even if you change your looks. It's fixed from the beginning. Also: That scene with Shapiro and Jenner was amazing. He provoked her so bad and she reacted the way he wanted her to be. That's how fascists win debates - by personally attacking the other party so they look bad and become defensive. And the chromosome argument is the dumbest argument ever... If something has 4 wheels, it's not automatically a car, if something has xy chromosomes, it's not automatically a man.

"I hope it is okay for me to point out that the non-binary/queer/not-decided/those who lieth betwixt/etc don't have any model of gender to perform. I don't *know* I'm a woman the way Tabby does, but I pretty much can't avoid being gendered that way because my massive chest makes it clear I'm AFAB. But even though I feel extremely uncomfortable with that, I don't get points for being feminine either because I perform it incorrectly and inconsistently. If gender is just what people perceive you to be, that means there's effectively only men and women, because it's not common to assume somebody is in any other category, right? So I guess no point except that if that's the way it is, that's pretty depressing. If gender is a social construct, it would be nice if we got together to construct another option.

"I'm not going to reference anything personal and instead talk about how i am currently reading nietzsche, which is maybe relevant to your discussion (particularly of Butler). 'Granted that we want the truth: why not rather untruth?' In Beyond Good And Evil there are a lot of sections where he seems to be taking aim at the subject as a concept (Aphorisms 16, 17, and 19). He also seems to uphold the idea that a set of beliefs being refutable is not necessarily a cause to abandon them entirely (ie. 'the eternal feminine'): 'It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is refutable; it is precisely thereby that it attracts more subtle minds'. I see these concepts as being connected to performativity as Butler puts it. I guess ultimately what made me write this comment was the way I felt that some of these points weren't necessarily referenced in such a dry way as I'm doing here now, but acted out in the way that Tabby and Natalie acknowledge a certain degree of validity in each other's positions despite each making it clear that the other's views are untrue...a performance of perfomativity...a metaperformative...whatever it's midnight thirty my brain hurts and i'm not that smart. i had work all afternoon. this is not worth reading. also i haven't finished the book yet so don't spoil it.

"The key difference here is the difference between Acceptance, and Assimilation.  Those seeking assimilation want to send the message that they won't rock the boat if they get let into the club.  That they wont challenge the existing power structure, they just don't want to be left outside anymore.  Overwhelmingly, the messaging tends to be subservient, since that's typically what power demands.  Those of us who seek acceptance, want to rewrite the rules that are excluding us, to challenge power and to lessen its ability to exclude marginalized people in the first place.  By nature, this is a more confrontational message.  It's no surprise clashing exists between the two groups, but, ultimately, I have no patience for boot lickers like Blaire.

No cis women can be as hyper-fem as society currently requires without an enormous amount of wasteful and expensive work. Since cis women can't make it, why should trans women go to extraordinary lengths?  Personally I feel that despite her combat boots, even tabby presents as quite hyper-fem in this video.

"Extrapolating this whole video to the arena of politics has me reaching horribly depressing conclusions.  If we live in an age where most people act around aesthetics first then aren't we basically a dead species? Our world and our aesthetics are so grounded in capitalism that we'll be banning plastic straws and manufacturing 'green' cars until the planet bakes us all to death.  You ultimately can't make lower consumption appealing under capitalism, since so much of our 'happiness' (for lack of a better word) is tied to consumption. The alternative (socialism) allows for vastly less material consumption but its not aesthetically pleasing either, and the arbiters of what we see as acceptable have been opposed to socialism since it's inception.  Since ultimately capitalism is what's driving environmental change and since nothing about capitalism is geared up to stopping this, if we live in an age where people act based on looks rather than some deeper sense of self or community, then we're basically dead.

"I personally don't think that I, nor Contra, can ever ACTUALLY *BE* A WOMAN. I think we can only mimick women and what we and society thinks women are. As far as I understand it, a scientist could take a sample of my spit and tell me what gender I am with an accuracy of 99.7% and until the science arrives where we can change our DNA then we will be stuck as mere imitation women. Which I think should be acceptable to everyone. That's NOT to say that the 'aesthetic' cannot be achieved to where others either don't see us as men, or see we are men and still agree to act as though we were women.   Even after the hormones and the surgeries, there is something biologically essential to gender and sex. Trans people are anomalous and should not be the standard which all else is judged. It should be, as rightfully is, the reverse standard.   I'm not sure which parts of that people will disagree with, but I am just laying out what I think is apparent as a male human. Regardless, I'd still refer to Contra as a woman just to not be a dick head. Though there could be some line that I won't cross in that regard. Not sure what that could be. Either way, it's an intersting topic and I enjoy the creative ways Contra braids through the subject.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Where I live, when men say 'I respect women' it mostly means they respect a union of their very narrow definition of biology, performative femininity, and standards of behavior. The moment you step outside any of that, you're robbed of your womanhood in their eyes, which is like tearing away a disguise for them, and with it - respect that should be default for any human being. That's why they beat us, but 'would have never hit a woman'. So it's pretty much impossible to consider womanhood as aesthetical or outward thing, here. It's an inside job. Even I've experienced this often, and I'm as cis as they come. I'm a woman because I know and say so, and that's the only reason. The end.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Tabby might be missing something when she talks about being an icon. She's a character that represents an extreme viewpoint created by someone who is known for exploring multiple viewpoints. Anybody who doesn't agree with her exact viewpoints, anybody in the center or even slightly right of Tabby, who might find her off-putting, can get on board with her anger because her message is tempered by her existence as a fictional character and the other characters in the Contra Points cast.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I think an interesting point I'd like to add is that acceptance of trans people (but only if they pass), really serves to reinforce the gender binary. I've spent time on trans forums, and I personally feel that a lot of people who could arguably be genderfluid or non-conforming are overwhelming informed that the solution to all of their negative feelings is to transition. Only then can you join this community of people who have a set of extremely specific commonalities. Unfortunately this almost universally includes using depression/dysphoria/social anxiety as fodder for making friends. So if you end up feeling that you don't identify as a man or woman, you're faced with the choice of losing all of your friends: all of the suicide memes and universal encouragement toward one obvious answer.   What I'm trying to say here is that it really hurts us as a society to only accept genderqueer people who fully commit to represent the epitome of the gender they're transitioning to.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The one thing I don't believe in this video: you being older than a small child in 1985.  That was a great video, and in it, you managed to hit where I have stood on transitioning friends: you've got to act the role before I can begin the process of transitioning with you.  I knew a person who identified as a woman, but through the four years I knew them, never made a single effort to *present* as anything other than a guy.  In fact, if I did not know them on Facebook, I would have merely thought them gay (because they *did* openly participate in society in the role of a gay man).  I think only twice did they ever actually communicate any feminine identity to me, and that was considerably more in passing than in any other situation.  I was deeply confused by the situation: this was not a person making any effort at telling me that they were a woman other than insisting upon it once every couple of weeks.  (Compare that to other trans friends I had at the time, including one who actively transitioned while I knew him: yes, the semester where he transitioned was confusing: he started the term as a woman, using a woman's name, a woman's identity, and everything else, but by the end, he was totally a dude: I've even forgotten his deadname.  And then there was the woman who was trans *and* a fairly devout Christian: the occasional impromptu dorm room bible study with her was actually quite enjoyable and engaging, mostly because half of the people there were more interested in Christianity as a cultural force than as a lived faith.)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"In a way one gender is always defined by the other. Man read articles on what women find sexy and dress accordingly.

What really matters is my phenotype and how I feel about it, not that due to some random mutation that rendered my Y chromosome useless.

"Is it fucked that I agree with the Justine character instead of the cat? Like gender literally is meaningless if no one recognizes you as what you say you are. If you identify as a woman but resemble a man and act masculine in every single way society recognizes as masculine and not a single person ever recognizes you as a woman, then you saying 'I'm a woman' literally is the equivalent of you saying 'I'm a lawyer' when you never went to law school or took the BAR. I don't think you can have it both ways. Either being a woman comes with 0 qualifications (no specific look, no specific behavioral patterns, no specific pitch of voice, etc) and is therefore a completely meaningless and arbitrary label or being a woman fits into some socially recognized set of aesthetics / behaviors that are accepted as feminine. Quite frankly I really don't know what it even means to say you're a woman but have a beard, speak in a manly voice, dress like a man, and behave in traditionally masculine ways. Like in what capacity are you a woman? Cause you claimed it? Anyone can be anything they claim by that logic and there will always be a glaring disconnect between how you identify and how every single other person in society identities you which I can't imagine is very productive.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"While this video is definitely more reflective of the transwomen community, the conflicting ideas of 'looking the part' and 'staying true to self' in aesthetics is applicable to most, if not all, walks of life.  I am a cis man, and the conflict of aesthetics is something I struggle with often.  I am an introvert, and I am more comfortable by myself or with a small group of friends than I am in large groups, unless alcohol is involved.  I hate attending job fairs and networking with professionals in my field because I have to pretend something I'm not.  Even if I were a prodigy in engineering, no one would take me seriously in a job fair if I came wearing a hoodie and sweatpants instead of a clean pressed suit.  I have to take the time to work on my appearance, else I don't get a job where I want.  The networking version of me is not a reflection of my true self, but I have to act in the way others want because that's what they will respond to.  I understand that my experiences are not as dramatic as those in the trans community, and I doubt I can imagine the severity of the conflicts regarding ones experience they face.  But this video really demonstrated that conflict in a way that resonated with my own personal issues, and I find that remarkable.  Very rarely do I find YouTube content that speaks directly to my emotional conflicts.  It certainly speaks to the remarkable writing and acting Contrapoints has in her videos when a conversation about shoes that is analogous to the struggles of the trans community can be also be a metaphor of a broader issue in the human condition, cis or trans, male or female, straight or queer, or whatever.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is such a deep conversation that needs to be had and it resonated a lot with me. As a non-binary trans person trying to define my own gender and balance how I want to express my gender versus how people will perceive that gender is a difficult task. I often struggle with thoughts that I'm really just a woman who's been conditioned to think that because I'm not big on traditionally feminine roles I'm non-binary and this is only exacerbated by the sheer amount of people who will look at me and only perceive me as my assigned gender.  Even as I perform the stereotypical AFAB white skinny short haired non-binary role I am still not respected and am misgendered.  I don't know where I'm going with this but this video really struck a chord with me as a young trans person only starting their transition. I think this helped me a little bit with figuring out my own feelings about myself but also about performativity and its impact on our community.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think both aesthetic choices have their uses. The traditional femme, among whom I would probably be included, can certainly be appealing to normies who aren't necessarily prepared to talk about the big stuff with a hardened genderqueer activist. Still, I think there is a place for a more radical, in-your-face type of approach. Feminism never got anywhere by only being acquiescent and appealing; it got somewhere by spitting in people's faces. We know this is true fundamentally as well. We would never have collectively understood what queerness could actually look like at its peak were it not for people sacrificing their public image for it. Each approach should justify the other. Justines should exist to slowly justify the existence of Tabbies, and Tabbies should exist to make it easier and easier for Justines take more room in public consciousness, to spread the political movement as widely as possible. It's foot-in-the-door politics at its purest.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

You point out the oppressive ways that transgender people are mislabeled, misgendered, othered, marginalized, and outright hated, and I worry.   Of course, then I worry about every transgender person I don't know, because even though I don't know them they're just as deserving of love and respect as everyone else, and I panic because I *don't know what to do to help*. I feel like words are ineffective, that voting isn't enough, and sometimes I feel like the only way to make people listen is to follow Tabby's advice and just carry a big bat.

"I'm a straight cis woman whose mother used to dress me like a boy so I wouldn't get raped which is really warped thinking considering that she was an early childhood development psychologist whose specialty was incest and eating disorders and knew perfectly well that boys got molested too.  But then again most psychologists are warped beyond repair themselves and never want to look at their own childhood.  Oh and projecting is their favorite sport.   Anyway because of this warped reality my so called hetero normative mother gave me, I really, really, really love exaggerated girly stuff like Sweet Lolita fashion and kawaii because I was never allowed to have anything like that as a child. I'm now realizing while I watch this that not only is femininity an agonizingly labor-intensive construct, almost like giving birth to a unicorn,  I also may actually be a cis woman trying to look like a trans woman.

"When the people I previously referred to as my family brought out the standard arguments against me, my first impulse was to bring out the standard counters. Every time I did that though, I was left wondering why. The main issue with the things they said wasn't that they were wrong, it was that they betrayed fundamental errors in thinking.  They said: I don't believe that people can show no signs and then suddenly wake up and say 'I want to be a girl'. I said: Signs are often invisible from the outside, and may not be properly interpreted even by the subject. The real problem: In their mind, what 'people' did was more significant than what I was doing. I either fit some narrative or I wasn't valid.  They said: What gives you the right to just decide what you are? You haven't earned your identity. I said: [something about the ridiculously high dose of estrogen I'm taking, administrative matters, body hair removal and so on] The real problem: They thought identity was something that trans people had to earn, and if you weren't willing to 'put in the effort' you weren't worth respecting.  They said: Biological sex is fixed. You can't just decide you disagree with it. I said: Actually, intersex people exist. The real problem: They were thinking that biological sex necessarily had anything to do with gender other than a strong statistical correlation, and that this principle was more important than actual people's lives and dignity.  Every time I gave the standard defense, I didn't actually change anything. I expanded their overly restrictive worldviews just slightly to fit myself into them, and every time I did something new I would have to do all of that over again. I was making things easier for myself in the short term, at the cost of legitimising and validating their views -- not only condemning myself to a performative relationship, but allowing them to feel better about disrespecting trans people who don't fit the mould quite as well as I do.  You can have a broad worldview and still be closed-minded. Attempting to broaden someone's mind is missing the mark -- the key is to give them a mindset where they want to broaden their own. To show them that understanding something doesn't have to be a prerequisite to respecting it. And the _only_ way to do that, is to be incomprehensible. To be civil to a reasonable extent, but have no regard for their preconceived notions. High risk, low success rate, and absolutely not worth it if you don't genuinely care about the subject (hence why I no longer refer to the above mentioned people as family), but it's the only thing that really works.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This was a surprisingly depressing video on the topic. Because the thing is, I don't want to have to 'perform' womanhood. The women I always felt most similar to were of the tomboyish variety... t-shirts and jeans, messy buns, sporty, etc. To think that they will always have that freedom to be seen and accepted as women by society regardless of what they do, where I'll always have to walk this thin line of being afraid that acting too stereotypically-guyish means that my entire womanhood can be invalidated... that is completely not fair. The only external displays of womanhood that I've really ever cared about dysphoria-wise are the physical-body-related ones and the societal-treatment ones. And that's unfortunately irreparable because, well, the puberty that I went through when I was 14 years old is over, and thus I can't go back and make my body cisnormative.  There are lots of us like this. And this exact dance between either having to perform femininity for society to make our body appear more conforming to their narrow gender norms, or just being ourselves and acting like we would have been acting had we been cis women but opening ourselves up to invalidation in the process... that is depressing. Damned if you do, damned if you don't... and all because of something we can't change which we never wanted to go through in the first place and which we've suffered tremendous anguish over not being able to correct.  I'm siding center-left toward Tabby's side. Surely something is fundamentally wrong and needs to change in a society where people are forced to do this, and where certain subsets of the community will NEVER have their voices taken seriously.

"Ok but concept: Gender is a social construct. Social constructs are made by people, and they gradually shift with the actions of people. We are people, so really we can make or break any construct we want and that's how culture evolves  Plus, having gender being only a performance of an already existing construct and archetype? That's really hard on nonbinary people, who often don't have a cultural image of what they look like and how they act. Or they relate to an archetype that isn't considered a normal gender. The archetype of Ideal Man and Ideal Woman are just as non-existant and mythological as, say, the archetype of an elf -- which people were identifying as their gender back in those pre internet ages when LOTR hit the stage  Plus, if a person has a gender and there's no one around to perform it to or convince, does it still exist? Does it and all the feelings and perspectives go away? For most nb people I know, it doesn't.   Gender is less a performance, and more a way of relating to the world, a place you feel you occupy in the big tangled web of reality and ideas that make up culture.   Like the metaphorical little imperfections that turn a clear, uniform, homogeneous rock into a colored gem, gender is just a thing that colors us. Like a gemstone absorbs and reflects light, gender, and identity in general really, is how you absorb and reflect the world, and ideas, and things in general  And even though some people can't see certain colors, or any colors at all, and we can't see beyond our little range, those wavelengths are still things that do stuff, even when not being perceived by a passer-by","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"God, this hit close to home. I identify as nonbinary, but I lean towards wearing women's fashion. Having a large chest means that men's clothes often don't fit, and when they do it's not as though it hides anything. I'd rather be able to wear my personal sense of aesthetic than stuff myself into stuff that makes me feel like I'm fourteen and still wearing ill-fitting band tees everyday . Having been born a woman, this, of course, means that I don't 'pass'. In this day and age, it's not as though there is truly passing as nonbinary, however there is almost a sense that you need to 'balance out' and wear clothes for the opposite gender as if to prove yourself. I fear for the day I tell someone about myself and they ask me why I still wear skirts sometimes. It feels so forbidden to not give up the pieces of femininity I may still enjoy, despite the fact that the whole sense of nonbinary for me is kinda just nothingness.

"I wish Blaire and Contra had a debate if Blaire's arguments are 'so bad'. I find some of Contra's opinions and arguments to suck and I find some of Blaire's to suck but both of them have made good points in the past. I really don't understand the hatred from trans people towards Blaire, isn't she actually someone you would want other people to act like towards you and perceive you as? As the gender you psychologically feel like but still acknowledge your biological sex and make-up of your biology, so perhaps when you go to the doctor and he treats your illness with hormones, he doesn't completely fuck you up? Because frankly speaking, outside of the doctor's office and olympics or sports biological sex doesn't matter? And if you think it doesn't matter there, well.. natural selection will take care of you and just look at the results of boxing matches trans-women had against biological ones. Cause we are still animals, with different biology, with different muscle structure and muscle growth. As an outside onlooker on this whole trans vs. cis people bullshit that has been going on in the world, all I have to offer is maybe a word of advice, as I never really held ill opinions of trans people until the SJW wave happened and still don't hold ill opinions towards their change rather than some of the member's behavior/opinions. It's not about aestethics, I have seen 'less feminine' looking trans-women than Blaire make good points against real women and I was always sold on what was said rather who said it. Don't just dismiss someone's disagreement with you because 'oh they disagree because I look less pretty than Blaire, nothing wrong with my logic here', be rational be objective.. look at why people disagree with you, don't get triggered immediately and dismiss someone's criticism of you as trans-phobia. I know there exists people like that, but you can still objectively look at their reasoning and dismiss it if it really is stupid. But if you are a trans person fighting people who are not really problematic, and fighting problems that aren't really problems, making up drama off small stupid bullshit, eventually you lose credibility, and not just yours but your whole group's. You have to realize that if you are going to stir the water at first people are watching, and if you just stir the water over and over for stupid bullshit reasons people will stop caring and get aggrevated just like the firefighters/ambulance/police if you call them over for false alarms. Use your brains, use objectivity, use rationality and don't dismiss science, biology, psychology etc as trans-phobic and people will agree with you. Majority of the western world is not ignorant so don't fight THEM, fight those who are still ignorant, show us the difference between life in the west and in the middle-east, show us the countless ignorant attrocities done by religious groups, don't discredit them by saying discriminatory murders are at the same level of transphobia as misgendering or not being attracted to trans people.

When your audience is well-versed in trans issues, tabby's perspective of speaking up with radical ideas that are just fighting for freedom from how gender exists currently would actually work. However, around the ordinary, raised-transphobic person, it makes more sense to start with keeping them comfortable and slowly edge them into being more comfortable with trans people and the most basic and simplistic trans issues. Without aesthetic, it's difficult to even break through the smallest bit to the average transphobe, and usually causes them to have an even worse view of trans people. Theres nothing wrong with knowing your audience, if there is an audience you want to reach, and using aesthetic to keep them from pulling away.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"She's right, though. When that professor in Berkeley was caught on video attacking somebody with a bicycle lock, it was bad Aesthetics and got a lot of people talking about antifa in a negative light.   David Duke is successful because he focuses on aesthetics, avoiding the more brazen  rhetoric and visuals of neo-nazis or the KKK that he was once a member of. The first day of Charlottesville was looking like a success for the alt-right because of the aesthetic involved with so many counter-protesters throwing things and appearing to instigate violence in the videos that were coming out of the event. It only changed because somebody driving a car into a crowd looks very bad.    The original Nazis understood the importance of Aesthetics & pioneered propaganda, using marches and the emerging field of cinematics to great effect. American propaganda understands this and is always designed with appearances in mind.  Even this very Channel makes great use of aesthetic swith the different characters and sets and highly stylized delivery- all of which have played a role in the appeal of this channel add Natalie's ability to reach such a wide audience of people who would not tune in to hear the same points argued by somebody sitting down at a desk in front of a white wall in speaking in a monotone voice.  Donald Trump was not elected because people rallied behind any real philosophy or ideology or comprehensive and coherent political platform. It was because he and the people around him nurtured and aesthetic of a political outsider, trusting that people would not question how somebody who has been greasing the palms of politicians for decades could be an outsider. Just look at the fan-made propaganda that came out of the subreddits and 4chan forums that his supporters tend to frequent. Riding on a tank, carrying an eagle, and far more fit than he is in real life- it's all aesthetics.   The leadership of a political party, the intellectuals, and a small minority of people in any large social or political movement really have a deep understanding of the issues and care about the underlying philosophical subject matter. The rest care about aesthetics and the benefits that are promised to them- and if you are promising that what you Advocate will benefit them, then you are arguably nourishing and aesthetic or affect as somebody who cares about them. If you go find the videos on YouTube of people saying that Obama was going to pay for their rent or the people who said that Donald Trump was going to bring back jobs that have been rendered obsolete by technology, you can see this for yourself.  Granted, those examples are arguably somewhat extreme, but it gets the point across.  What Tabby doesn't understand is that while we recognize her as the lady with the bat, it's not because of the underlying philosophical justifications that she might put forth for the smashy smashy. It is because of her aesthetic as a bat-wielding Anarchist cat girl- an aesthetic that blends the bomb-throwing anarchist archetype with the fetishized neko girl. If any other person or character or to attempt to clearly and academically lay out the rationale while wearing a simple pair of slacks and a blazer and sitting at a desk, few people would listen. There is a reason that antifa adopts the black Bloc tactic, and it's not just to conceal their identity.  They nurture a certain aesthetic.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I can see both sides of that debate, but I think that the way you phrased it drifted slightly in a 'pull yourself up by the bootstraps' direction. I agree that people can generally choose to present themselves in a certain way, but I'm not sure every trans person has the capacity to adopt a given aesthetic. Some people may choose to live one way out of necessity, not just because they want to express themselves as a nonconformist. Mind you, I'm saying this as a cis man, so I'm not living these issues, but I can see how your message might fall a little flat for people who want to look a certain way, but can't because of the circumstances they find themselves trapped in.

I see the comments here remarking on how this video might be less accessible or relatable or such, but that they relate to it anyway. I can confidently say I don't relate to it in almost any way, but that you nevertheless seem to have presented both sides of the argument quite well, and left me uncertain on which approach to womanhood is best: the one that offers more inner peace, or one that demands sacrifice but nets more social acceptance. It very much seems to be a conflict for CIS women as well, although I've never seen it broken down and argued quite like this. Anyway, I just wanted to say that as someone very far removed from your struggles, I was able to understand and empathize with both sides you presented, and I think that's because of how well you presented them. This might not have been intended for me per se, but thank you, and I look forward to seeing your videos in the future.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"There's a lot of support here which is really cool to see. The 80's aesthetic is really awesome imo and I liked the imagery you invoked when you used glittered up battle paws to change the dials on the tv. I believe that people should be able to to live as they see fit and that you should in this modern society change your sympathies and expectations of behaviour often because everything is changing at a rapid pace, in the 80s openly gay were a neglected and unwanted minority now they are more accepted and can marry.   Technology changes every decade, just 80 years ago we were in our living spaces listening to the nightly news on developments of the situation in Europe, now we carry everyone we know with us day to day in our pocket and can listen at will to the thoughts of people we want to listen to.   So I'll close this train of thought on the idea that I'm one of the people that enjoy listening to what you have to say contrapoints. I don't know if referring to 80s technology is a reference to how different society was only 40 years ago but it's an apt one to make if that was the case. The interesting thing is with all the emergent technology it becomes easier to control us in some sense (NSA social media showing trump news because an algorithm decides that's what gets them ad revenue, echo chambers) but it also is a place where you can be exposed to ideas and opinions you would never have entertained if all you got was some white guy on the evening news speaking in some posh mid atlantic accent.   We've done some good things in 40 years in 80 years let's hope we don't spoil a good thing and attempt to halt our progress to a more diverse and more interesting society.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I feel like both Tabby and Justine are correct simultaneously (which I think is the point of the video). Tabby is arguing about how the world SHOULD be, Justine is arguing about how the world IS. I am a Black cis intersex woman, so I experience aspects of this conflict on a few different facets.   Many, if not most, people of color practice code-switching, the act of changing one's speech and/or behavior in order to be more palatable to a white majority. Personally, I code switch in ways that temper my expression of emotions/behaviors that are stereotypes of Black women. For example, when I'm around non-Black people I don't express my anger as readily, I try not to be 'sassy' so I use a more subtle humor, I don't let my voice get too loud even in situations which would normally warrant it. And those are only some examples. But I am in Black-majority spaces so infrequently (I live in a majority-white city, go to a majority-white university, etc.) that I start to question whether this code-switching, which is a performance, has become so habitual that it is now a genuine part of who I am. Like, I used to be a pretty silly and expressive kid, and now I'm not. Did I just grow out of that naturally? Or did I realize that Black woman aren't supposed to be silly and expressive in order to be taken seriously, and I changed not just my behavior, but my personality itself? I would love to take Tabby's point of view and just say eff it to the majority and act however I want, but the sad reality is that when I take Justine's POV, my life is easier because the world accepts more just a bit more easily.   On the gender side of things, I probably think about my gender expression much more than most cis women because I am intersex. For context, I was raised as a woman, I identify as a woman, I am universally perceived as a woman, and I express myself within the boundaries of acceptable femininity (i.e I'm not the girliest girl but I don't shop in the men's section either). When I was growing up, I didn't consciously think about nor control my gender expression. I just did and wore what I wanted to, and I didn't think about it any deeper than that. But as I became more away of my intersex condition in my teen years, I began to question why I felt like a woman at all. After all, there are parts of my body that are not typically female, so that's not why. So is it because I was raised as a woman? Would I still identify as a woman if my parents had decided to raise me as a man? I mean, I intellectually understand that sex and gender are not the same and that they don't necessarily correlate (and obviously many cis non-intersex people understand and accept this too), but it's a whole other thing to have to deal with that difference on a personal, identity level. I even experience a mild form of gender dysphoria (I think. I'm using this term because I can't think of another one, but I don't want to misappropriate it so if there's another term for what I'm about to explain someone please tell me.) I really, really don't like the parts of my body that aren't female. They make me feel like less of a woman, even though I know that my sex has no bearing on my womanhood. I've even considered surgery. I'm trying to be all Intersex and Proud, but sometimes it's difficult, and I just want to be normal.   Anyway, this was a great video and I'm glad I found your channel. Hopefully all of my commentary is useful to at least one person.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Sorry, I'm a bit too tired to attempt a proper reply in English, maybe I'll come around to it this weekend, but in the meanwhile, this is another argument that could be made on behalf of Tabby (in Portuguese).  Embora seja verdade que posicionamentos agressivos comprometem o processo dialogico em contextos locais, esses mesmos posicionamentos agressivos podem ser importantes como performance politica, rompendo uma hegemonia ideologica dominante e opressora. Atos revolucionarios e de contra-cultura sao sempre -- e portanto -- a principio chocantes e afrontosos, mas sao tambem necessarios para que aquilo que e considerado afrontoso antes se normalize ou se torne desnecessario no futuro. A mesma violencia pode ser 'localmente' condenavel e 'socialmente' justificavel: seja pelo tapa de Ahed Tamimi ao oficial israelense; seja pela desobediencia civil de Rosa Parks, seja pelo acoitamento dos vendilhoes por Jesus.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Excellent video as always. The thing I can't seem to reconcile is this idea that gender expression is a blank slate drawn in by culture . While I'm by no means an intellectual, it would seem that biology plays a rather large role in behaviors and gender expression. Take children's preferences for violent stories being favored for young boys as an example (I apologize having no study to cite atm). I wouldn't think that animals develop a sense of gender via this proposed 'blank slate' like bower bird nest building. That to me seems to some extent instinctual. I feel like this whole gender debate has countless variables within it that make the definitions so hard to honestly define. Is hypergamy cultural or biological? Is this significant to gender expression? I can't believe that gender alone is a social construct, but I'd be equally dishonest to say it's completely biological either.  Take the fact that trans people have variations in brain biology from non trans people of their biological sex, and maybe in that sense they are biologically their desired gender. Both left and right approaches frustrate me, as the right flat out deny any sort of flexibility in gender as the result of culture, while the left claims it's completely defined by culture and not biology. It has to fall somewhere in the middle, which while extremely difficult to grasp, may make everyone actually reach a consensus on this issue.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"certainly for the present age, which prefers the sign to the thing signified, the copy to the original, representation to reality, the appearance to the essence... illusion only is sacred, truth profane. Nay, sacredness is held to be enhanced in proportion as truth decreases and illusion increases, so that the highest degree of illusion comes to be the highest degree of sacredness.   The celebrity, the spectacular representation of a living human being, embodies this banality by embodying the image of a possible role. Being a star means specializing in the seemingly lived; the star is the object of identification with the shallow seeming life that has to compensate for the fragmented productive specializations which are actually lived. False choice in spectacular abundance, a choice which lies in the juxtaposition of competing and complimentary spectacles and also in the juxtaposition of roles which are at once exclusive and overlapping, develops into a struggle of vaporous qualities meant to stimulate loyalty to quantitative triviality. This resurrects false archaic oppositions, regionalisms and racisms which serve to raise the vulgar hierarchic ranks of consumption to a preposterous ontological superiority.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I cannot speak for women. I mean, I can try but it's gonna have obvious inaccuracies. But I can relate to some of what was said. As a gay man who's (like many others) had to juggle many circles including the extra gay clubbing scene, the stuck up 'locker room type' boys who'll endlessly talk about vagina but if you mention penis they threaten your safety, and the many variations of how people expect gay men to be around them, I've definitely had to perform a lot and to learn what the most functional and adaptable me was, and then become that me. It's a daily exercise that I only ever get better at. But I always feel frustration. Frustration that anyone's expecting me to be something that's not accurately me. Frustration that I'm bending to them like a good little slut (which I am). Frustration that I don't really know what's the next thing I'll have to learn to be 'proper' gay.  Now, it's not all ugly and bad. I've learned to enjoy most of it, most of the learning. To become interested in what people think gay men are like. To have open arms when the next big trend of drag queens and gay performance will knock at my door.  But the frustration always comes back here and there, for major and minor details. And I definitely agree with the Cat girl, and I would love to smash the people who expect a lot out of me for ridiculous reasons. But I don't hate Natalie as depicted in this video. I'm not completely lost as to why she says what she says. And she's still right that I'm gonna end up performing my identity in conform ways, way more that I'd have expected in my college activist years. And I'm at peace with some of it, just like I had to learn to be at peace with saving money and doing sad sad work. And making plans that had to do with anything other than my own expectations, that was always a nightmare. Now, it's just the way to fit in society. I keep in mind that someone out there has ideas as valid as me and that disagreeing with them won't make me have the life I expect. We'll have to meet somewhere in the middle and understand that we can't just hate each other's expectations. We all have expectations, and we all end up performing accordingly. It's kind of a form of respect, really. It's messed up from a philosophical standpoint, but it works in real life and it feels really good to not fight itall your life.

There is no 'passing' as nonbinary in our society so really what nonbinary people do is exist in the way they feel the most comfortable I think- or at least that's what I do. For some people that means dressing a certain way, going by different pronouns, name, maybe hormones and/or surgery, and other people don't- each goal HAS to be individual bc you can't really 'pass' and nonbinary isn't a social gender role in the same way 'man' and 'woman' are.

"I remember watching the episode of Elementary where Ms Hudson first showed up, I immediately loved her because she was tall and big and statuesque and gorgeous. Then of course the show felt the need to point out that she wasn't cis and I was really annoyed, because I wouldn't have noticed otherwise. Trying to train our brains not to notice gender appearance so much and just go by names and pronouns is hard enough without media not giving trans folks a chance at passing.  No wonder old school feminists clash so often with trans activism, where we see the performative aspect of femininity as oppressive and cruel since we've so long had no choice but to be pretty, demure and glamourous - trans women see it either as liberating, an expression of their inner self, or a survival mechanism. I'm one of those cis women 'going off the grid' and I get along fine. Other women appreciate a girl who can use a hammer and drill when they can't, or someone who sees the value in both male and female-coded work.

"This was a cool video. I was disturbed by Justine's argument: to say that gender is just aesthetic and just how people look at you is like asking if a tree falls in a forest does it make a sound. I'm a woman when I'm sleeping and when I'm awake. I'm a woman when I'm outside with people around and when I'm inside with absolutely no one looking at me. To say that gender disappears when no one is looking at you is also a form of robbery? I don't know what gender Is necessarily, but I've got it, and I've got it all the time. You know that intimately, I'm sure. I think what you're saying is that there's an accentuated public self versus and private self as a trans woman? coming into your own, but also having to accentuate your Own in the public eye to people who don't understand who you are or where you come from. I think I relate to this as a biracial person, I enter spaces and people's immediate response is scrutiny of my race, who I am, where I come from those kinds of things, instead of Me. Anyway. I like your meta moments and your characters, it speaks a lot to the innumerable little critics that we have in our heads as marginalized peoples.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"The post modern concept of aesthetics trumping reality and informed debate is heavily depressing to me, though not quite as depressing as Justine throwing Jordan Peterson's bastardization of Nietzsche's master-slave morality at the lefty 'Behemoth' character, chiding her for having a victim mentality.  When the Behemoth character wants to respect logic and be her genuine self, she is in no way playing the victim, quite the contrary in fact.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I am not trans, and although I am not going to say that my personal experience is equivalent to the situation expressed in this video, I can say that this really resonated with me.  I have always hated my looks, I have always been a tom boy, and I have always worked in male-led industries. For 25 years I didn't know how to really apply make up, I never style my hair, never wear anything other than work clothes, and act like a greasy line cook. I am not feminine.   But there is power in being feminine. When I do dress like a woman, EVERYONE changes how they treat me. They talk about how, 'I clean up nice' and hold eye contact with me longer. They smile more, and people listen better.  I have always looked up to characters like Daria from MTV. I always wanted combat boots, crazy colored hair, and baggy ass Tripp pants with chains. I always wanted to be unabashedly me. But I find myself constantly hating feminine women for having society's love, approval, and attention. Hating them for making the effort to make themselves seen by society, and thus having power within it.  It is petty. It is childish. I want to dress like a sloppy poor dude and still be seen as beautifully feminine. But that isnt how it works. I am glad to be me, but I see the trade off in personal comfort vs social standing.   I feel like this video wasnt meant for cis girls like me. But it really resonates with me. Thanks for this,   Nat. I don't know exactly how this video makes me feel.

"This felt like such an intellectually honest video. The dialogue format and the fact that you let arguments go to their logical endpoints without resorting to politically motivated distortions work really nicely. Finding arguments politically repulsive is no excuse not to give them any thought - our job as progressives is not necessarily to deny the factfulness of opposing talking points but to give them our own spin/narrative and disarm our opponents by showing that the facts don't really show what they think they show.  I know it wasn't the main thrust of this video but I found the stuff about the nature of gender interesting. I've never really found Butler's performativity theory convincing. It comes with a kind of a superficiality that I don't like and I think Tabby is right to point it out.  Gender seems to me to be contingent but not arbitrary. That is, there's some kind of inner determination (or 'inner truth' like Tabby would say) involved but ultimately it's impossible to 'prove' to be this or that gender. Marks of sex/gender, like behavioral traits, genitals or even chromosomes, only function as long as we don't interrogate them. Ben Shapiro can point to people's chromosomes as long as he wants but it's simply impossible for him to explain how having XY chrosomes makes him a 'man'. Why are these 'male chromosomes'?  Aaanyway, I hope there's a lot more to come. Your videos about trans issues are probably your best ones (no surprise there!). Even for me and I'm cis. The fact that you're passionate about these topics and struggle to make sense of them really shows - and transforms into quality content.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"That inner voice calling for optics is a result of the historical treatment of transpeople, and having to deal with an unequal playing field. As a transperson, you want to be what you want to be, but there's this subconscious societal wall that screams STOP, don't, just don't, and you're left wondering if you should. You perform a cost-benefit analysis, you play out what might happen, and you push the envelope in subtle ways, hoping to ease into the 'role'. You want it to look natural, you want acceptance, but what you want isn't what you get. My trite semi-coherent babble aside, words matter, but actions matter even more. Actions to effectively counter dangerous ID laws, societal malfeasance/harassment and inadequate legal protection. Fight the right fights.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"One of the realizations of living in a communal reality is that other members of reality can, to some extent, modify the reality as it relates to them.  If someone views you as crazy, then to that locality you *are* crazy.  If someone views you as a woman, a man, or otherwise, then they have enforced that reality in their locality.  When a larger group within communal reality does this, they have a larger effect by virtue of making up a larger part of that communal reality.  Likewise, if someone has a lot of social capital, whether that's the personal-to-you capital of a confidante or the communal capital of a public figure, then in their place of power do they also have great effect.  However, you must also recognize your own ability to have an effect on communal reality, and that your effect within your locality is also greater.  Rebuking those who have a toxic effect on the communal reality is its own kind of power.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Ben Shapiro is wrong about the genetics.

"Ok, I'm going to be the a-hole and everyone is going to yell at me probably. For me, my gender as a woman comes from being raised as a woman and all of the expectations and experiences that come with that. Now I know that a lot of people will say I am a TERF for saying that but that is honestly how I identify with my gender if I am really honest about it. I accept that trans women are women and I don't buy the asthetic argument because as Tabby said, non-conforming cis women are still women. What the hell makes someone a woman then? I seriously don't understand what the reasoning is. If it's not experiences then what the hell is it? If you say, for example, that is is a way of thinking then that is also sexist because what the hell is a 'male' or 'female' way of thinking? I mean most of my interests are 'typically' 'male' and that comes with a lot of limitations. While Nat was studying philosophy at uni and passing as male I was being laughed out of my politics class because as a woman I couldn't possible understand politics and as a woman, I am rarely taken seriously in philosophical debates. My partner (a cis man) is the one in academia while I stay at home with the baby and I have to deal with his intelligencia friends assuming that I am supid because I work in childcare (a job I took to support his career in a tough job market) I have seriously never gotten a straight answer about why people who are not raised as a gender identify as that gender.

"What I like about these discusion videos is how I can empathize and agree to a certain extent with both characters. In Justine's case I think she is correct when it comes to being a cis-facing trans activist. (This is just a term that I made up, so I would define it as being an activist that is attempting to improve the Cis perspective on Trans people.) In this circumstance Justine is right, if you are making or participating in media who's primary audience is for Cis people then passing and being civil is extremely important. When fighting for the most basic rights of trans individuals it will be easier to pass favorable bills when the public perception of trans people is them being the pinnacle of masculinity or femininity. Now this will lead to poor stereotypes of trans people, one that will take a while to stamp out and bring the perception of trans individuals back to a more reasonable center. That being I think getting basic legal protection for trans individuals and changing the perspective away from the idea that people who are trans are simply pretending to be their gender is more important then the negative repercussions that will come from Justine's perspective. Tabby's perspective on the other hand is more important when looking at trans focused trans activists. (By this I mean activists are focused on making trans individuals and people who are experimenting with gender identity feel more comfortable and understood.) When looking at these activists Tabby is absolutely correct. Justine is presenting an unhealthy and untenable presentation of femininity, one that most people who are transitioning or are looking to transition will not be able to meet, at least not for a very long time. For these people its important to tell them that there isn't a right and wrong way to be trans, and they can express their gender how they see fit. A balance of activists like Justine and Tabby are needed in order to build a holistic and functioning trans community. (Wow that was longer then I intended, I am cis btw and this was just my perspective and my take away from Natalie's video. If you disagree with me please respond to this to let me know, I really appreciate feedback and different perspectives.)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"To me I think this video perfectly highlights that often the problem within conversations about gender identity is that it ignores how the category of gender itself is the problem. The idea of performativity laid out by Judith Butler (who later when talking about how TERFs used that to bash Trans women said that 'one should feel free to explore the course of our gender identity') only gets us so far as how we can live our best lives in response to gender being put upon peoples bodies. We live within the confines of what gender is, but we need an insurrection against the very limits of its existence. Judith Butlers original point in creating 'Gender Trouble' was to outline how the idea that there is a 'Female' subject at the heart of feminism is the problem, because the 'Feminine' subject is always being reconstructued. There is no template to which one 'attempts' to mimic femininity (which is the point being made when Tabby asks where do you get your ideas of gender from'. What 'Femininity' is is determined by its juxtaposition to Masculine norms. Thus the very idea of 'gender' itself as a category that limits the characteristics of ones existence I believe is the problem. This is a super good video and I liked it a lot!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I found this video really powerful Justine. As a cis woman I obviously cannot relate to having the validity of my gender identity scrutinized on a daily basis, but in seeing the struggles of trans men and women close to me, and in my own experience as a woman with autism, the dichotomy of optics/aesthetic vs unchecked inner expression hit home. The philosophical question of whether the identity we perform for society is reality; or whether the identity of our personal 'truth' is reality; is something I struggle with. I don't intend to remove trans women from the topic of this discussion,  but I've realized that trans women and autistic women have similar experiences with that dichotomy of self-expression. There is also a disproportionate percentage of transgender and non-binary people within the autistic population so it wouldn't be too farfetched to note similarities.  Women on the spectrum can develop 'masking' as a survival mechanism wherein they observe neurotypical behavior and alter aspects of their own 'optics' to match. This is a very energy intensive task and in my case lead to depersonalization, dissociating, anxiety and depression. Some develop eating disorders. Experts believe masking causes women to go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as BPD or bipolar (also common in transgender people).  Most experience extreme relief after diagnosis only to realize that gaining introspection doesn't free them from societal expectations. Masking isn't limited to women but is more common, I believe due to the limited range of how society perceives acceptable female behavior and appearance (like Tabby says). In professional and political settings (which are often one in the same) women, in general, need to do a lot more to be respected - makeup, gender-appropriate clothing, smiling and speaking delicately to not seem 'rude'.  The social mechanism is the same for autistic women and trans women but the outcomes are different - when autistic women don't conform, we are seen as rude, untidy, incompetent; when trans women don't conform they can be seen as all those things and also get misgendered.  In the end I don't really know which way is better (changing optics to fit society vs free inner expression) but perhaps the cynical answer is changing aesthetics of how society views trans and autistic people will validate these groups in the political conversation and thus lead to a better chance of society accepting a wider range of inner expressions.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Pre-transition trans guy here, and I'd say this is a pretty accurate depiction of conflicting inner thoughts.

As you are in these boy clothes, you look like a foolish girl trying to be a man in everyone else's eyes and there's nothing you can really do about that.'  It's a vicious battle because both sides are right to a degree.

I've found myself surprisingly apt at quite abstract discussion in many topics like these, many times fueled by pure empathy of personal experience, and my own 'trans-informed' mental structures/schemata.  Sometimes it makes me feel hopeless that certain, seemingly simple, ideas, are so difficult to be communicated by limiting languages and 'normie's' communication barriers, much less accepted as a real thing.

The games often say that crossdressing is fine as long as you look attractive. Yeah, the characters in those games are comfortable in their biological gender but the majority always have the characters say that. I even read interviews and on YouTube where they have asked people about transgenders. That it's only fine if they look attractive. Personally, I don't like it.

"I honestly stopped watching Blaire White when I realized how much of a shill she was lol. She needs to realize that the only reason the people she's brushing shoulders with 'tolerate' her is because she's pretty and is constantly sucking them off. That's why 'rational skeptics' consider her the cool one, because she's non-threatening.   If she actually used her platform to speak out about trans issues instead of, say, sending waves of hate to someone with a different ideology and trying to label them as a faker (which ironically was something she was accused of), or using derogatory slurs and 'memes' against other transpeople for brownie points, she'd get a lot less support from the right.   I'm all for people speaking their mind and breaking away from supposed groupthink, but she's proven time and time again that she's only out for herself and doesn't give a shit who she tramples on.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This video is incredibly well done and I really love it, i'm young trans male. Pre-everything and constantly getting misgender. The idea of trying to pass is a good one, especially for me. I live in a terrible state for transgender individuals, and I see a lot of people who act like tabby aka fighting back with threats and all that does is hurt people like me. I don't dye my hair anymore, I don't act the same. The more i see people acting like mogai the more I am terrified of having to go to my school counselor saying another kid is outing me and harassing me.  But at the same time, I don't believe the clothes have a gender. I don't think that trans men should have to act super masculine and I don't think trans women should have to act super feminine but it's a society that we all live in including cis people.

"Excellent video :) I just want to help clarify a part where you discuss 'gender performance'. Butler uses some pretty poor wording in Gender Trouble, so she's had to go out of her way to clarify what she means by this.  To my understanding: Gender Performance is exactly what it sounds like--literally acting out a caricature of what any given individual deems to be associated with the gender.  This is often done in theatrical and showy ways such as through drag. GENDER PERFORMATIVITY on the other hand is what Contra referred to as the 24/7 drag: it is how all human beings subconsciously act out their gender through what they say and what they think.  As a man, if I gravitate toward blues and blacks instead of yellows and pinks; this is not natural, but is instead me acting out the gender conditioning that my society has exposed me to.  For trans women, their gender performativity typically aligns more closely with whatever happens to be the opposite of their bio-sex (though this is not always necessarily the case).  Having a GENDER EXPRESSION that doesn't match your bio sex involves the acknowledgement of societal gender norms and twisting them, taking what any given society deems to be related to one gender and adopting them yourself (ei: choosing to wear a skirt means that my gender expression is female, even if I am a straight bio-sex male who identifies as male).It's all a lot to take in, but gender is complicated, so I've tried my best to understand it to the best of my ability.  If anyone thinks that I said anything inaccurate, please feel free to correct me, as I'm always excited to learn more about these topics. Peace.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"i'm not really sure i was able to follow this one very well... largely because i was pretty much completely unable to see Justine's side of things. it just seems so backwards. weren't we supposed to have moved past this point? i mean, i know we're not completely 'there' yet, but... in principle, i think Tabby is completely right here (sans the smashing, but literally just the smashing). trans people are visible now. we should be able to be respected regardless of how far along we are in our transition. i know the world still sucks, and it's not like i plan on going out in public in a bra before i've figured out how to remove/hide my facial hair, but capitulating just... seems so regressive. ...not to mention that... and i swear this is genuine and i'm not just saying it to be... mean or anything, but... Tabby reads to me as more authentically feminine than Justine does... though that could just be because i grew up in the emo/goth crowd...","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Btw Natalie, I loved your critique of Butler and her whole gender performance and gender performativity framework. That whole but with Tabby and Justine was extremely interesting and I needed to hear it go down like that. I'm a critical gender studies grad from college and that's some entry level stuff that's really... Well it's part of your bread and butter when you start out those first upper divs. I liked your use of aesthetics to deconstruct that framework and propose via Tabby how identity matters too that convo and can't be so easily set aside in favor of this 'repetition without an original' stuff that's honestly pretty dismissive of individual identity and personal experience. Butler seems to always be very ???? in incorporating trans people and people of color into her frameworks  Obviously the point of your vid was something much more important and personal, I just wanted to say what was sticking out to me most on a first watch and why (I'm a cis queer xicana). I can't wait to rewatch a bunch more times  since there is nuance here I think is very important to understand. Thanks again for a great video Natalie!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"as much as i absolutely love this video and resonate with tabby a bit, i think there's also something to be said about the trans people who DO try to their fullest extent to pass, rather than rejecting norms like Tabby. i'm one of those trans people who... honestly does try a lot to conform, but also wants to maintain some of my personal aesthetic and style. of course, it's a different experience for me as a trans man, as womanhood comes with a LOT more expectations and a lot more tied to it, but i still think there's a lot to be said on this topic still. also, amazing video! i think it's fitting there isn't much that's explicitly conclusive about it; the trans community still really hasn't talked about optics, because i think a lot of us don't want to admit how much influence it has on us, and just assume it's by default part of the trans experience. the video really gave me a lot to chew on!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I really enjoyed this video and while I am a cis woman and do not share the same experiences as transwomen I think it is valuable to analyze gender in this way. The point that a large part of gender is what other people recognize you as along with your personal identity pulls a lot of weight. After all, part of the journey of people who decide to transition is having other people recognize you as the gender that you identify yourself as. I would imagine part of that identification comes with observing what standards our society attaches to women and men and identifying whether those standards align with your own identity. In that vein of thinking, it would be important that other people treat you like the gender that fits you best and many people have a hard time treating people as the gender they identify with unless that person conforms with society's standards of masculinity and feminity. I would personally love to see some pundit try to argue that men and women are treated exactly the same in every context and that we do not have differing standards and expectations between men and women.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I can go to my local gaming store for some magic the gathering wearing a see through shirt with a black lace bralette and a long black skirt, wearing a full face of some of the best make-up I can pull off, but if it's not completely on point, or if my voice is slightly too deep, I still get misgendered.

"Here's a concept.  DUMP GENDER.  OR, realize there is not one damned thing wrong with being a masculine woman or a feminine man, but most important of all there is NOTHING WRONG WITH FEMININITY!!!  The trans movement is in too many ways pressuring many that don't follow standard gender norms to identify as a gender other than themselves rather than working on doing away with these outdated and limiting gender rules.  Instead of broadening the definitions of gender, with A LOT OF OVERLAP, the movement seems content to keep people of all genders in gender boxes.  Many of the points Tabby made to me were right on the money.  We need to get away from gendering things like styles, careers, clothing.  (By the way, I am a cis, straight male, that as long as I have been alive have preferred so called feminine styles, and go out as I like when I can.  I throw people off because I identify as male even if I look like Morticia Adams, or Siousxie Sioux.  There is nothing inherently any sex about hair length, pants, skirts, leggings, COMBAT BOOTS  (:P ).  There is skant little inherently biological about how one moves...it is all socially pushed, and yes, constructed.  By the way....more power to Tabby!!!  To the issue of the murdered trans women.  Something that is being kept out of those stories where, and what they were doing at the time of their murder.  A majority of them were selling their bodies to Cis men.  The reason they were doing that was not because they like to, but because of sexist notions in the working world and places that are STILL able to indirectly practice sexism, by NOT hiring trans people.  This is why ALL gender based dress codes, and presentation codes need to DIE.  Guh, that Shapiro and Zoe bit is so beyond grating.  She did exactly what that little dweeb wanted.  She fell right into his trap.  The error and failure points I am seeing is when schools say 'Students may dress in line with their identified gender.'  Instead of flat out saying 'Students may dress however they like, as long as what they were is within length and cleanliness guidlines.  The same should happen for company dress codes.  If a man can wear something, then so should all genders working there.  If a Woman can wear an item or style, then so should all sexes that work there have that choice.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"So what you are saying is : at one level of reality it doesn't matter what's right, it only matters that we win. Well WE s a variable. What if WE are bigots,, or just wrong? On another level it matters not who wins but that 'I' am true to myself, to my life. ? In Aesthetics I must look like someone who conquers Shapiro with a winning smile. In inner reality I must suffer every cut, every jibe, every denial, of all the oppressed  of all  descriptions and be lmitlessly resilient because I am in love with life, because  . . . that makes a better narrative (more aesthetic and more true).  Or something?  cue Wonder Woman? URL URL ?  I wouldn't usually commend identifying with a super hero closely. It's too damn stressful living up to a alter ego standard. Really, a kind of self-abuse. So I'm convinced there too. If I understood you correctly about living a Cat with a bat life.  Agreed, in toto, in fact.   Great video. So slick","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"ily!!   this video really helps to explore something that a lot of (lgbt) people feel but can't quite express, and its the first time ive seen this concept in a video and not in loaded literature. this is one of my fav videos of yours!! years ago i used to express my feminism by non-conformity. later i expressed my ftm feelings by presenting myself as somewhere in between, because i thought masculinity was inherently bad.   both of these expressions were detrimental to me and my cause. i wanted to be taken seriously, i wanted people to see me as more than a stereotype or an embarrassment. i decided that if i wanted to be a man i would have to go all the way, and that if i wanted to be a woman i had to conform. this way i could change normie minds lol. i actually thought of it as... kind of an agent on the inside...   it's a form of oppression, to lack the freedom or safety to present as you desire, but an oppression that you can play to your advantage.   i think a major step in Extremely Online Lgbt Theory is learning that the most effective way to change the world and live your best life is to be accepted/to pass. passing as a trans person (women esp)... even being acceptable to hetero society as a lesbian, a feminist, a radical, is seriously a tool in shifting the... social overton window? when these groups are seen as friendly... normal... it changes views. it's depressin, but it's realistic. but making trans people Look more acceptable on tv, online, eventually makes it safer for people who don't pass. its all the long game.  again, ily!! ur like the vsauce for useful information. stan...","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's more or less the most classic of problems with modern leftism, that the people who are so strongly advocating for worker's revolutions are the farthest thing from the vast majority of workers. If a person can't see themselves in you in any measure, then they're not going to follow you into any meaningful movement. That doesn't mean you have to be exactly like them.

"When you say it's not a philosophical battle, I agree, I think I just take that farther than you. I think what we see on the news, in art, reflected in our laws, in the ideas of everyday people, are just reflections of the more material facts of people's existence. Like, I don't think it will help to seek to change the appearances of things in media and culture; I think these appearances are downriver from where people actually form their opinions. Even if right wingers are good at optics and left wingers aren't, why is that so? Can it reasonably be changed by pure will?  It reminds me of people saying black people need to improve their communities by pure individual will - pulling up pants, not joining gangs, etc. - ignoring that these problems stem from their sociopolitical situation and its history, that these problems and the narrative surrounding them have been constructed around this situation. To me it's like being stranded in a boat carried away by the ocean and faulting the ocean for taking you in a certain direction, and trying to will it in the other.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Stuck in a world where people just refuse to shut the fuck up and mind their own business. Where people feel how people choose to dress impacts their own life somehow... where they think my decisions about who I find attractive somehow makes me more or less relevant. Where people are attacked because others don't like what they do with their bottoms and genitals in private...  This world is messed up, and the current trend whatever it is really, which is pushing people to the extreme right or left, is literally tearing the world apart and what is left behind will be tyrannical authoritarianism...

"This video bring up a very important duality, content x form. As the yin and yang, this duality is complementary instead of contradictory. One can not live without the other. You will not eat a cake that doesn't look/smell good, you will not approach someone with unfriendly body language, you will not notice a book without a good cover. But you also will not like a cake that looks/smells good, but tastes like crap, nor a person who seems friendly but treat you rudely, nor a book with great cover but bad story. It is easy to dismiss form as being shallow, but it is part of reality, the part that signals to the external world what might be inside. Form is not about hiding or enhancing content (although sometimes is used that way), but it is about comunicating it. I don't think we can combat the shallow uses of form (the meaningless stereotypes) by just rejecting it. We must embrace the importance of form, if we want to use it for display of real content, instead of just a facade. I, giving a simple example, don't care about clothes, but I dress fairly well, because I know other people will judge me. I don't dress exceptionally well, because that would be unauthentic with my personality. In the same way, in other instances we must find a balance between who we are and what we want to communicate with other people, taking in account that stereotypes are just inevitable. I know that things get complex when is about your gender identity, but, how complaining about things that you can't control improve your quality life? If I hate dressing well, how not dressing well improves my life? More often than not, life doesn't hold up for our standards of fairness. But I wonder if, once we, as a society, starts to understand and appreciate the importance of form related with its content, we could get rid off useless stereotypes, and hold to the more fair and humane ones.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The difference between our authentic utopian dreamer selves (tabby) and the political animals that live in our society (Justine). Justine compromises her values in order to be practical enough in a cruel world in order to further the very values she compromised. Its fucked up, its heroic, its tragic.   We want to destroy the current social order, CAN we destroy it from outside it, by refusing to conform to its standards. Or MUST we subvert it from within, by 'passing' our views within the overton window for small victories won with the consent/compromise of our opponents.    Obviously, destroying the Patriarchy from the outside is more desirable, and if possible, should be done. Justine questions this, she claims the current cultural hegemony is so strong, that we have literally no choice but to enter the Patriarchy and compromise for what we can.   Fine. Whatever, fuck society, fuck injustice fuck bigots and fascists, but most of all, fuck defeat, fuck futility and fuck failure. I know what the quest for justice is, I know my allies, and we must, we MUST, WE MUST enter circles that pass laws, that change views, that shift society. The current leftist community is not adequate to that task, and so the legitimacy, the rightness, the Justness of their views are rendered many times worse than wrong, they are rendered impotent.

"What exactly is gender then?  It's easy to conceptualize masculine (cis)women, and it's easy to understand feminine transwomen. However, it's confusing when someone claims to be a transwoman, but presents themselves in a masculine way. In that case, what does the claim of womanhood even mean? We've already disconnected genitals, chromosomes, and other biological (and latent biological) traits we are born with. Femininity and masculinity, on terms of how one acts and presents oneself, seem like the only criteria left by which we define womanhood. As sympathetic as I am to a transwoman facing with an internal crisis like this, we need concepts people can wrap their heads around. Demanding unquestioning sympathy and acquiescence to the demands of the most radical transfolk about how they should be viewed is not a sustainable strategy for solving this dilemma.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a cis man... I can see the points of both Tabby and Justine. They are both right and wrong... and that's the 'problem'. It's not a 'either/or'. It's a complicated issue without a right answer. In the end... people want acceptance, even when they say they don't. Tabby says she doesn't care about what other think... but the fact she gets frustrated when misgendered shows that is not entirely true. As Justine says... are you a doctor if no one considers you one? Maybe there's a point there... a woman is broadly who society considers to be women. And as bad that sounds... it doesn't need to be. We can expand that. Tabby doesn't need to change so that she can fit into society's definition of woman... instead society's definition must expand to include Tabby. But also Tabby will never accomplished that 'smashing'.  In the end I just rumbled... and don't know... I actually don't know. That's why I subscribe.

"I think this video is really needed. Too many people are more interested in feeling self-righteous (beating TERFS with bats) than in making actual change (by sitting down and having a conversation), and in the process of doing so, set back the actual progress that more moderate individuals are making. That being said, I will disagree on one point:  I am a trans woman for no one but myself. I define my womanhood based on the hormones in my body, and the secondary sex characteristics that I am able to influence via the hormones. Now, in business settings, I put on a badass suit with heels to make myself feel powerful. In a social setting, I wear a nice dress to feel beautiful. In most other settings, I wear leggings and a t-shirt to feel comfortable. In each situation, I'm presenting for no one but myself. I would rather live in a world where I saw myself as a woman, but everyone else still saw me as a man, than a world where I had to see myself as a man, but everyone else saw me as a woman, because at the end of the day, I am the only one (relative to the cis world) that has to live with my dysphoria.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I rather enjoyed the music -- especially the sort of spooky bits. Good job to whoever did that.  As for the notion of aesthetic and identity... I (a straight cis fella) feel like I could ramble on about how I don't like that mindset for a long time. But to keep it short, I find the pursuit of aesthetic and using it to define who you are to be pointless -- I see how it is a rather weighty matter for a trans person. But I'm thinking back to my high school and college days when I recall a lot of people who decided that what they looked like determined who they were to a far greater degree than what they _did_ and what they _believed._ Frauds, essentially. To me, that way of thinking seems like it leads to insanity, or (to be less hyperbolic) to dissatisfaction and a feeling of emptiness. We all have different struggles, and like it or not appearance matters since those of us who are sighted rely on appearance a great deal. But I've personally always preferred sincerity of character. Just BE who you are. Whether or not you look like a woman, _be_ a woman. Right? (Geez, it's soooo easy). The appearance will matter, but I find it matters less so than Who You Are At Your Core. And though I may be ridiculously wrong here, I suspect that transitioning isn't just about looking like a woman -- otherwise a person could simply stick with drag and perfect that illusion -- but feeling like one for your own peace of mind, so that even when you don't put in the work to dress up you still _know_ you're female despite lounging around in pajamas with messy hair and bingeing Netflix on the couch.  I really hope I didn't come off as patronizing, because that wasn't my intention at all.  Of course I also think that the clothes we were are irrelevant. Suits... how bizarre is it that suits are accepted to confer some notion of status? Or that a straw hat seems to detract it? It's all so completely arbitrary. If the entirety of the human race woke up tomorrow with complete amnesia about our cultures and wardrobes and everything else with no clues to remind us... what would that world look like a week later, or a year later?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I'm a  5'2 trans  man,  Contra. I'm  curvy  as  hell. and I'm poor. being  trans  is  self-accepting the true  self  and if  i  wanted to  play  pretend  and  play  nice for respect want  then...  why bother?  i would rather  get misgendered in this gray  area  that a lot of people drift in during their early transition  because i  can't  afford  top surgery or  continuing HRT  than  to have  never tried. i am not a man and  any trans woman is not a woman if we do or do not pass.

"Why bother catering to the armchair centrist  expectation that a disadvantaged group has to  be personally  responsible for their own acceptance? Isn't it more practical to approach social reform and acceptance as a block? Real life doesn't work like some tacky oscar bait film revolving around some 'magical minority'.  If we demanded every Black person have to prove themselves individually worthy of respect instead of passing legislation or advocation block social reform odds are there'd still be segregation and apartheid. So why should we endure it as trans people.  To do so would be to give into that 'Myth of Time' that MLK critiqued in his 'Letter From A Birmingham Jail '. He was skeptical of gaining anything other than easy allies, so why shouldn't we be? Why should we limit ourselves to the Sisyphean task of winning over the Ben Shapiros of the world when we can gain a lot more allies educating those who are initially ignorant but instantly on board once educated? Why give in to society's demands that  we have to individually win over every alt-right edgelord omni-skeptic in a 10000000000% logic based debate when we can improve our station in society with allies that will actually fucking listen?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Maybe I'm failing at basic philosophy, but it seems to me that Nat was arguing for a Hegelian view of trans people in society, wherein a person's identity cannot be crafted in a void, and is dependent on a society to measure itself against.

"This reminds me of the fault I find with many of Judith Butler's followers as well. They read Butler, but do not read Kojeve, Husserl, and Hegel. Identity itself (not just of gender) can be understood only through the performative ritual. While there is almost certainly a precondition that makes one a woman, trans or otherwise, we only discover what this means through action, reaction, and recognition. We experience reality phenomenologically, not objectively. We do not experience reality, ours or that of others, directly but through a variety of filters and an illogically ordered sequence.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Tabby seems to be placing subjective experience at the center of reality, and honestly sounds more on point to me. There is no objective reality. Society is an abstraction, not a conscious observer. How you feel about yourself IS your reality. There is nothing more real or present than experience. Respect for the experience of others is where a lot of people get hung up on this and similar topics. These are my thoughts and now the internet has them oh no.

"So what is Ben Shapiro's Aesthetic?   I mean really, this is an amazing video but some of the discussion on aesthetic vs trans aesthetic feels... idk compromised? I feel for any label or identity this is a hell of a confusing question, especially with layers like consumerism or assigned identity of any kind put on it. Like bikers were sold a line of how someone who owns a Harley should look and act, and that's a pure choice that applies to men and women that fall into it and is ... mostly racially ambiguous. Hell as a comic nerd there's some of this idea of Aestetic that can be a hurdle to overcome. I say this not to detract from anything in the video, but to point to how heightened it is when you're talking about sexuality and a base identity. While it's totally relevant, I think the topic is too complex to tackle without some apt contrast... or comparative points and get a real tangible take away.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This might be a bit unrelated but I have a question I've been really struggling with lately -- ever since I started learning more about feminism, I've always read and been told that gender is a social construct -- but when you take trans people into account, doesn't that automatically disprove the social construct idea? + doesn't it reinforce that there are only two genders? I read a few posts and discussions about how kids are being pushed into one of two boxes from a young ago and that's the reason people can feel dysphoria, because they're pushed into the wrong box, and the solution would be to abolish those boxes in the first place. And for me that made a lot of sense, but then I was told that those opinions came from TERFs?? And now I just don't know what the right way to think is...

For exaple the only reason its feminine to wear a dress, its because people keep acting as if it is, and if you want it to be otherwise, you need to act as if it isnt until people are forced to abandon their previous asumptions. But as i said, doing something like that can be dangerous so its not wrong to conform, its just not helping.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"So if you're unable to pass (or just plain ugly) then you aren't a woman? Yes, there are things people can do to improve their chances, but genetics simply don't allow all transwomen to pass. What if you're a late transitioner? Does your inability to adequately perform femininity mean you shouldn't bother? I agree with you to some extent that trans people should understand why they would be expected to go the extra mile to pass (compared to cis people), but I think your arguments assume too much about peoples' ability to perform another gender.  As an aside this seems to throw those who identify as nonbinary under the bus completely, but I have very little experience with that subject so I won't press it further.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Doubt anyone will read this comment but here goes:   Ok, this all makes sense to me, EXCEPT for the part about MEN being in power. I mean, let us assume that society is not patriarchal in function for just a moment. To me, a man, manhood seems to get revoked at just about the same rate and at the same rate that womanhood does. A lot of small men have to deal with performing masculinity all their lives due to their height being seen as unmasculine. Skinny men have to prove it due to their lack of physical aptitude. Fat men, bald men, men without facial hair, men with gyno or physically disabled men. Even men that perform masculinity to its peak might have their 'manhood' revoked because they are not straight, or because they like shaving their legs or because they use a lot of skincare products. And this revoking of manhood is often not introduced by other men. Women revoke manhood just as much as men might revoke womanhood because a woman is not 'fuckable' or 'womanly'. Isn't the whole 'men decide what's true' argument kind of... void in practice? Because as much as I agree with the general explanation and idea of 'aesthetics' here, I can't see the argument that men the cause of the aesthetical dilemma as true in the context of your blonde character's argument.

If a machine with a detector was to perceive it, it would perceive it without the context and experience processing and give the result objectively. Just like in the black-blue vs. white-gold dress, the people who saw white-gold were fooled by their brain as it perceived the color with the context of 'oh when things are lit up by light, they are lighter'.

"You argue for the vice of images, but just because the images are cogent, doesn't mean they have staying power or, more crucially, humanity itself (which is ending).  Your points are all totally valid, but the conclusions are meaningless and depressing. Plus, they only apply if you already come from a culturally and genetically privileged enough background that allows you to slide into your costume for the LARP session. Otherwise you're just fodder for the decadence of the upper classes. God is dead. Putting on heels and drinking designer champagne or whatever won't bring him back to life. It's hard to build a sustainable, non-dystopic ethos on a fragmented pastiche made from the echoes of a narrow and distorted image of historical contexts that we can't possibly understand or inhabit.  The problem is not that appearances supersede meanings: It's that the convolution of appearances themselves are reflective of the multiplicative and exponential breeding of informations. It's like Baudrillard says: 'We are not, however, in danger of lacking meaning; quite to the contrary, we are gorged with meaning and it is killing us'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Plus it always seems like a competition over who is the most oppressed within the LGTBQ community. Everyone is going to hate me for saying this but I actually found solace within the conservative community because they could care less whether I like dick or vagina, they dont judge me on what label of sexuality I hold on my sleeve. Most of my 'friends' in the LGBTQ comminty could care less about who I was as a person and would often say 'you wouldn't understand because im not a gay black woman' or whatever it may be. Its not about someones individual character anymore but about what kind of oppressed minority you are.

Conformity never helped those who cannot conform. Conformity is just how we close the door behind us when we are deemed acceptable. Women conformed to romantacised 'male' conduct in the workplace and those who couldn't conform suffered. Black people conformed to romanticised 'white' conduct and those who couldn't conform suffered. Being born transgender never afforded me the privilege of maleness and I can attest to that with years of evidence. I cannot conform to romanticised 'maleness' and I suffered because others could. I cannot conform to romanticised 'femaleness' and I will suffer for that too.  When one person manages to confirm those who wish to deny us will simply contract their definitions and increase the difficulty of attaining conformity. A transwoman doesn't need to look like a cis woman to conform. She must look like a pornstar or a model. That is where we are. So fuck conformity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"13:39 This is an important point that I think writers like Judith Butler misses in their writing (or at least had not adressed in the pieces I've read of her). By emphasizing the individualistic performativity of gender, they can be misread as essentially claiming that social roles are atomistic: that anyone can be anything if they truly believe so and perform it. What is missed is that gender, and all social roles, are not just the prerogative of the performer, but of the audience as well. Simply put, social roles are relational. Gender is relational. Race is relational. You can claim you are a woman (or a man) all day long, but if no one in your social surroundings accept that, then you are, for all intents and purposes, still the gender you were assigned at birth. This is what's called 'social reality', which more or less means that if everyone believes something, and act as if though it were true, then very often, it's impossible to challenge that notion, or even consider that it could be false. Just to be clear, I'm not making a value comment here - I'm not saying this is fair or good, or anything like that, but rather that emphasizing performativity without underscoring the crucial role played by audience acceptance is misleading and potentially sets people up to fail (or at least become very frustrated) by not including all the factors of the equation.   We live, for example, in a world were being 'trans-race' is essentially impossible, because, in short, it's part of the 'social reality' that race cannot be changed due to various ideas of what race *is* (ie. deeply materialistic/essentialistic and informed by long-standing power-inequalities that makes such a concept of transition either deeply offensive or outright laughable). I know it might come off as a false equivalence comparing this to changing genders/coming out as transgender, but it's the best analogy I could come up with that shows how we kinda arbitrarily decide what is considered possible and impossible within a cultural framework. Being transgender is of course considered equally impossible in a number of cultures, and no matter the performance would probably just be shot down as eccentrism or insanity. Or if you want to get into some less West-centric issues - consider the issue of changing castes in certain parts of India. That's socially impossible in many cases, no matter how much you change your profession, name, diet, worship practices and so on. In the eyes of many people, your caste is integral to your very physical body and spiritual self, it's a part of the dharmic cosmos, not something you can change.  To use a brutal example: even if you perform man-ness every day of your life, but no one accepts this as a valid performance, then you'll probably end up in a grave with the female birth name, and every historical record naming you as a woman and nothing else. The unreceived or rejected performance is often simply erased.  Now, it is of course possible to challenge social reality, which trans and gay people know a helluva lot more about than me (and I've probably veered too close to cis-splaining as it is, I hope not beyond), but it is hard. It takes time. And it is potentially very, very dangerous. Remembering to get the audience (ie. friends, family, coworkers, neighbors, wider society) along and accepting of the premise of the performance is, whether one likes it or not, crucial if one actually desires full range of expression and acceptance. How to do that is outside of what I know.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is the worst ContraPoints video thus far. I don't exactly know the quality has degraded so much, but it is just the same scene, the same everything, but the narcissism is more and more palpable and some of the things written don't sound so tongue-in-cheek anymore. The more recent videos all just seem like a set of strawmen that are set up and made fun of. The dichotomy of the question set up in this video is so false. And I think that ContraPoints is quite isolated politically and publicly due to not having any pushback or healthy conflict from real people, and the result is videos like this.   There is no nuance in Natalie's argument, and Tabby's is poorly represented and poorly argued as usual. Considering in the past ContraPoints has espoused the viewpoints shown by Natalie here, and seems committed to them personally, going into this video and knowing that the uploader personally agrees with Natalie dampens the entire video for me. It makes it much more obvious that Tabby is misrepresented and other characters are strawmen. If the videos get worse and worse from here, I can't imagine what they'll be like.

"I feel like this hits me kind of hard. I stopped voice training because I didn't feel comfortable conforming to what cis society expected of me as a trans woman. But I think it's unfair to claim that most of us *can* look like that if we put the work in. Many of us are exhausted from transitioning the amount we did. Yes, as white women we have a lot of privilige, hell I probably have more privilige than most living in Sweden, but at the same time we live in a society of relative comforts.   If you can manage to transition to the amount you want, that's great. But a lot of us can't. It's not always a question of standing up to society. Hell, the only reason I don't voice train today is because I'm exhausted, I don't want to make a political statement anymore and society being shitty to trans women has a part in that, esp when talking about trans women who began their transititions before the 'tipping point'.   I love this content, but I feel it misses some critical points regarding opportunity to transition and opportunity to play the part society expects from you. I think this also influences why many trans women don't fit into either box of 'aggresive stand-uppy type' or 'passing fulltime effort' type. Some of us struggle halfway.   But I know that maybe wasn't the point you were making. I don't know, I was just made slightly uncomfortable by this, as a trans woman myself having transitioned since 2012. I don't know, just some thoughts. I love you and your content, again. Praise be dark mother","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This is so interesting to me from the perspective of a cis(ish???) lesbian because I shaved my head partially hoping men would stop hitting on me but then shortly after, a man hit on me in a shop when I was with my ex gf who also has short hair. It made me feel stupid for ever thinking anyone would look at me and think 'that person is not into dudes' unless they already knew me. However, I still have uniquely feminine insecurities that make me want to dress nicely and put on 30 minutes worth of makeup every time I leave my flat. I also never really considered that I was anything other than cis before shaving my head but it made me realise that my own gender is sort of capricious. I really like Cameron Esposito's interpretation of gender; she sort of equivocates her own gender to 'David Bowie'- it's just what makes her feel seen, what she feels looks like her aesthetic. I think if I used that method I would say that my gender is 'pisces with a previous emo phase'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As beautifully dizzying as this was. It feels like your gender dysphoria is gerrymandering the definition of woman to allow yourself to identify as a one. If gender is how one performs one's sex then that implies that there is a correct way to perform it, when the way that we perceive gender is descriptive. If men started taking up art instead of sports then art would be the manly thing to do. I am a man therefore anything that I do is manly, as in I am doing it in a way that a man would. If I decide that I want to put on make-up, wear a dress, and suck a dick then descriptively I am doing it like a man because I am a man. I'll grant that masculinity and femininity exist objectively as can be measured by the white to gray matter ratio in the brain. But as far as pronouns go: they are quick approximations to refer to one's sex, if you are lucky enough you might imitate a woman well enough you might be approximated inaccurately. As a thought experiment to determine if pronouns refer to gender or sex I imagine if my 'male' brain were put into a female body what would I expect people to refer to me as? The answer seems obviously female, to expect anyone to guess that I have a masculine brain would be unfair and to ask someone to refer to me in accordance with how my brain is structured is asking them to break their internal  categorizing mechanisms for me which undermines why we have such faculties in the first place.

"Aesthetics is an interesting part of gender and misgendering. I'm a cis woman and I don't mind being misgendered online where people assume I'm male from my text, but find it hurtful to be misgendered in person.   Usually it's because the other person is intending insult, and you can write them off as being a dick, but I was once in the very confusing position where someone was genuinely trying to defend me while misgendering me. Myself  and a boy (let's call him Sam) at school where incredibly similar in height, hair type and hair length. I never wore the skirts that came with school uniform and everything else was the same. If together, we were often mistaken as siblings or even twins. It was something that amused us. The lad misgendering me meant well- one of his mates called me she and he was trying to defend me by pointing out 'Don't be a dick, he's obviously a guy.' While I knew he was actually defending Sam, and in some ways it was more mistaken identity than misgendering, I was too shocked and confused to speak up while he was listing off all my masculine features and convincing his friend I was Sam/a boy. Other than wearing trousers (which is more unisex now), I thought I looked 'pretty/feminine'. It didn't help when I finally pointed out I wasn't Sam that the lad was embarrassed and got defensive. It hurt and made me put a lot of effort into separating myself from Sam through hairstyle, makeup, wearing skirts and tights. Honestly I hated it and the compliments I got after were strange double edged things that felt like they were rewarding a lie. That I only got to be 'a girl' if I put effort into it. I couldn't just 'be' a girl by virtue of being one. I didn't get to be recognised as my gender unless I played by their rules.  And yet, I don't mind people misgendering me by text- by my words and personality alone. I've even been told 'No, I don't believe you, you type like a guy' when trying to correct someone. That just baffled me more than insulted me. Sometimes I'm even happy leaving the assumption because it's easier being a guy online. Yet having someone see my, in person, and go 'you look male' hurts.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Shamans have know this for millennia. Reality is not as important to the human consciousness as the perception of reality. To change perception, one needs to adopt symbolism and make it so authentic that it is more real than the thing it co-opts. We all want to believe that authenticity is king, but it is a pale comparison.   The burger you make for yourself tastes ten times better than the one from the fast food chain, but you can't spend millions of dollars on commercials that convince everyone that this is true. And that form of advertising propaganda is so strong it reaches even the cynical.   I _know_ McDonald's tastes like crap but I guarantee that some point this month I will buy it, and be disappointed afterwards.   Even knowing this doesn't make me immune.   Also: Tabby I love you and your combat boots stomping oppression. You make my heart pound. But then if my own personal tastes were what drove the world, we wouldn't be stuck in this spectacle of a culture.  Last also: Thank you again Natalie for making another thought provoking and entertaining video. Never stop.   Double last also: More Tabby please.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I really liked the video and agree with a lot of your points.  There really is only one argument I don't agree with, and it's that you had better arguments than Blaire during your debate. You had a few points, but I thought Blaire made much more sense overall, like in arguments about child transition or whatnot (been a long time, I don't remember it that well).  You can argue that your points were better, and I think you could argue that people may have favored Blaire's points for reasons beyond the points themselves (I think I remember a few of her responses having a 'don't put feels over reals' that a lot of people feel strongly about, for instance, or even simply that since it was on her channel, there were more of her fans), but I think it's pretty dishonest to claim that 'people just felt she had won because she was prettier'. I personally felt she had the upper hand in the debate because what she said overall made more sense to me than what you said overall, not because of your looks.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I have no problem with trans women being women or participating in life as women, but you lose me when you say that gender is purely a performance.  Menstruation isn't performance, giving birth isn't performance. There are many elements of femininity that are the direct effect of biological experience of womanhood and its reprocussions. I am in favor of inclusivity of trans women in the community of women, and I respect their identities as women, but I run up against a brick wall when I am told that my biological reality as a woman is meaningless and that if I acknowledge those elements of my womenhood that trans women do not share, then I am a TERF and thereby the enemy.  Seriously I want to be your ally and advocate but that seems impossible because I would have to subvert my own lived experience as a woman and mother in order to be an ally?

"Besides not being a fan of the word Aesthetic, every point that Tabby made resonated and the other character felt like she was just throwing words out there. I also cringed at the proposed definition of Art in this. However, the reason I resonated with Tabby is because I feel like there are people who just can't make personas. There is an element in Contra's videos where the characters represent an idea of Decadency and they push that value onto others, like how it was pushed on Tabby, but conversely, could it be that Tabby's Decadency is having value in who she is and feels comfortable in being? In essence, while the two characters wouldn't each use the word Decadency, they each represent a different kind of it in their striving for self-affirmed value.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm a Cis, straight, white male and realize that I was born on a mountain of privilege.  That being said, I never thought of my gender as performative.  Even when I was little I remember really disliking what I felt was expected of me as a man.  I grew up in the rural Midwest to a father who had very clear expectations for me.  Still, I was more feminine than those expectations and more performative (I liked doing impressions of men and women from film and television).  It was only acceptable at the time because I made him and everyone else laugh.  I also realize now how lucky I was to be able to do that, how I sort of tricked my way out of having to be what my father and many others wanted me to be.    Regardless, this video made me think of that.  It made me realize how privileged I was both to be able to do those things with little question and how much I take for granted now.  Now-a-days I just wear whatever with little thought.  I suppose I put on a bad performance because I'm not all that interested in it, but that's partially because it seems like no one cares about it.  I'm just not questioned and scrutinized like so many others are.  Thank you for the video and I'm going to have to become a Patreon supporter because all your videos are fantastic.

"Growing up as an unattractive cis girl, I genuinely really felt worthless and dysphoric because I, even being born female, was not valid for not being 'correctly' female. It was honestly traumatizing, I was considering intentionally injuring myself so that I could have my face reconstructed. So when I talk to my trans friends and they point out features that they have that they deem not female enough and want to change, I feel genuinely hurt. If I look like that as a cis woman, am I also not good enough? But it feels like Im in the wrong for feeling this way because being a trans woman is much harder and more important than my cis feelings. I dont bring it up to them because I wouldnt want to make them feel like Im judging their wanting to transition, but some elements of transition do genuinely feel mysoginistic sometimes. I hated myself so bad as a teenage girl that I felt like I didnt deserve to live. Is that not also suffering? Arent trans women and cis women in the same prison sometimes? It concerns me, the idea of validating that prison by obsessing over conforming rather than working together to tear it down. But I feel like even having this opinion is considered transphobic and I need to stay out of it?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"While Judith Butler has been recently cancelled for defending a sex pest who preyed on her students, I feel like her views on gender are more than performance and that's worth talking about.

She's gone in hard at her transphobic peers in radical feminism for their gatekeeping, essentialist, gender boundary reinforcing bullshit.  ...which, again, makes it a shame that she's sticking up for her shitty creep friend.

"Gonna be real I don't even know what you're doing nowadays. My assumption has become that you're trying to portray two extremes to help people level out their views but I just don't agree that that's a solution, or even remotely helpful. That assumption also implies that you think at least a significant degree of what you're saying as Justine (is that even her name? I feel like you've changed it before but idk) is correct, true, or helpful. Either that or the 'she's trying to dogwhistle reactionaries to expose them to far-left ideologies and convert them!' explanation, which basically means I guess the channel just isn't for me anymore.  All this as I keep hearing stuff about you having coffee with reactionaries amidst excuses of how you're trying to convince them or develop strategies against them or whatever.

"I made this long comment. But do I  'b e l i e v e'  in it?...    or is it just a 'p e r f o r m a n c e'?: -  'Destiny' describes himself as an 'egoist' - but also someone who is educated and rational and self-conscious, which he argues stops him from being selfish while also ensuring he looks after his best interests. It's an interesting rhetorical take (though not a new one) with regards to debate as you can not really argue with it - unless you know him personally (where he says that he is much less of an egoist to his loved ones). I'm kind of paraphrasing, but I'm sure you get the idea.  I respect Destiny a lot. But I imagine that you don't personally have an egoist position (I like to  i m a g i n e  :P). But (this is where my face goes all wrong from falling head first into an automatic paper shredder in some back storage room and don't get discovered for a few weeks until the janitor does a routine clear-up)..    Does Destiny 'believe' he is an egoist?...  I'm wondering about beliefs in the context of an ever-changing technologically advancing society - where basically what your parents know is useless for applying in the time you live in...  and, similarly, what you know won't serve anyone in the future as it'll be redundant. In this case, it does you well not to hold strong beliefs - as they will also have to keep changing. But at the same time, without strong beliefs you may find it difficult to react effectively (though there is also the argument that you would be more flexible). I guess it is interesting to think about how your relation to an ever-changing world effects your relationship to yourself and those either close to you or distant from you. Of course this has been well looked into (I'm just crap and haven't properly looked into it).  (LOL - I'm not telling you what to do...   it's just the dumb way I articulate myself...    y'know you gotta f0ck everyone)","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I wonder what Judith Butler would think of the phrase 'gender is performance'. She's pretty outspoken on the difference between saying 'gender is performed' and 'gender is performative', largely because the former conjures up the idea of 'playing a role'. I don't claim to fully understand what she means since I don't have a background in academic philosophy like Natalie, but in an interview she said that the 'performativity' referred more to creating a 'series of effects'.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"If I can pose a counter argument on Tabby's behalf (about 13 1/2 mins in):   On the flip side, if someone else calls you a helicopter, does that make you a helicopter? Sure, people can call you things that are hurtful, and sometimes it hurts because it's a painful truth, but the source of the hurt in a case like that is the fact that it doesn't reflect the inner experience being a human (or a cat, I suppose); it's because you're not a helicopter that you would be bothered by being called one, and not some secret painful inner truth of being a helicopter.   Ergo, misgendering can be a kind of perceived robbing of gender, but it is only painful *because* of how it contradicts the inner experience, so it isn't an actual robbing of gender so much as a perceptual one - not a painful truth, but a painful *untruth*. Aesthetics can help others (and maybe the self) to navigate away from such untruth, but even in the absence of the aesthetic and the benefits that come with it, the inner truth is still what it is. In this way, the effort to stamp out misgendering is really an effort to promote truth, aesthetics or no. Does that track...?   I mean I guess that's where they end up going anyway, I was just a little surprised that Tabby didn't seize the opportunity to flip the helicopter analogy back around.   And the notion that we're living in too much of an aesthetic age to rely wholly on a philosophical approach was... well, a pretty painful truth that does have to be wrestled with to some degree. Point taken there, I guess. Oof.  Anyway, excellent video once again, love it!","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm reminded of the music video for Jay-Z's Death of Autotune. Seriously, bear with me.  The song and video are all about authenticity, how Jay-Z is actually an authentic 'grew up in the hood' street gangster.  But how is that shown visually? Not through the aesthetics of what he authentically is (if nothing else a black man who became successful), it's all the aesthetics of The Godfather and The Sopranos.  He's in an Italian restaurant where the chef pays him his respect, then goes to play cards in the back with Harvey Kietel. The whole thing is showing that he's an authentic black rapper by posing him as an 'authentic' (i.e the media version) of a white Italian mobster.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"This was such a good video Contra! The 'debate' about how trans women perform femininity has always bothered me immensely (same with how trans men do masculinity, but trans men are almost never seen in media). Trans folk get judged on how we perform our identity every second it feels like. I'm a fairly young genderqueer kid and I haven't had much time yet in figuring all of it out, but I've been thinking a lot of this recently. If how I perform is masculine or feminine, and how I'm being seen by everyone else around me because of that 'performance'. Especially since I don't fit into the binary, there isn't an 'ideal' non-binary model I can adhere to or try to perform. I don't put much time into changing my body and if you didn't ask me for my pronouns, you'd probably guess my assigned gender directly. I have some self-evaluation to do I think.  Gender is confusing, I'm going to watch people mix slime now","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Uh, I listened to Tabby's opening lines in the second dialogue, and I was in total agreement. Yes, all art is ideology, all art is politics, all art is philosophy. No, not all good art has to be explicitly revolutionary, but all good art should be subtly/implicitly revolutionary. Just like all those famous 19th century bourgie artists didn't say 'Fuck the workers and Africa,' they're art still upholds that philosophy. Our art doesn't need to explicitly say the opposite in order for it to contain revolutionary undertones and philosophical foundations.  No, I don't think anyone should be forced to conform to patriarchal gender roles and beauty standards in order to be respected as their gender.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I just want to be happy. I don't need to have all the answers. Should I be fighting or conforming, who the fuck knows?! I'm just a person and everyone else is just a person too. And maybe there really is some person or people who have all the right answers, maybe there exists the perfect philosophy, but honestly, I'm not one of those people and I never will be and watching videos like this is greatly distressing because it makes me really realize that and feel it really strongly.

"This reminds me of that time RuPaul said women can't do drag (ie. be drag kings). I think it's really reductive to reduce womanhood to a performance. It is, but it always seems like it's MORE of a performance than being a man. Like the whole Simone De Beauvoir 'one is not born but rather becomes woman'. A man can become a woman, through drag, but womanhood is different to manhood in that men are the default human.idk this seemed overly neurotic. My existence as a woman is not, ever, determined by visuals. And it shouldn't be for trans women either. Trans women have to live out of the realm of politics.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'I'm actually a lady who used to be a man dressed as a man dressed as a lady'  That's pretty easy to explain really. It's an interesting use of varying definitions being used in conjunction with each other to make a simple statement seem complex or even unexplainable. I'll break it down by replacing the definitions for the words.   Im actually (a person who exhibits/embraces characteristics and mannerisms which are commonly associated with femininity) who used to be a (person who exhibits/embraces characteristics and mannerisms which are commonly associated with masculinity) portraying a (person who exhibits/embraces characteristics and mannerisms which are commonly associated with masculinity)  dressed as (a person who exhibits/embraces characteristics and mannerisms which are commonly associated with femininity).  Interestingly the entire sentence could also be preceded by 'I am a male who is actually a lady....' and still be entirely true while also providing some concrete and practical knowledge unlike the original which tells us nothing of any use to anyone besides yourself.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

With my really too small sample size of 12 people so far I've found correlation between age to this definition, where younger people view identity as a matter of relation to oneself where's adults (~27 and up) tend to view it more in relation to society","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I don't know how I feel about this one. Yes, you may get a few concessions by conforming, but those concessions will end up gated behind conforming too, since it's the image you took to get them. If we're just fighting for the right of passing transwomen, rather than every nonbinary and nonconforming person, we're going to end up alone very quickly. So yeah, if the goal is to let the luckiest few get the same misogynistic treatment cis women get, that works. But if that's the goal, I'd rather go down fighting the real fight for everyone oppressed. I'm not saying the point about aesthetics isn't valid, but we should fight under the aesthetics we want to be recognized under, not those they want to impose on us, because we'll only win the rights to be the fake self we showed.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

So some Trans women feel they gotta OVER DO being a woman.  Which is actually 'A man's IDEA of what a woman is.'  18:00-18:30.  It IS sad.  It kind of like how Blaire White helped alot of straight mostly white young males be more accepting of Trans women.  BUT it is due to Blaire being hot, white, and Conservative.  And that fact that Blair is harsh on Non-passing Trans women.  And this is coming from a fan of Blair White.    18:55-19:40.  Sad.       FIY I'm still subscribed to Blair  but I am now more specifically of her.  Also Blair did recently released a video saying that in LA she met Conservative Youtubes to that fake being Conservative for the views and pateroen money.  Blair mentioned some of those fake Conservatives told her to say/do certain things to boost her Youtube fame + donations.  Who knows I might unsub from Blair.
