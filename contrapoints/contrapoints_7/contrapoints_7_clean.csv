I don't like her because it's clear she's not a gamer and just found a specialized niche for her basic AF style of Femininist/Cultural Analysis. She's not brilliant, she just literally did something that no one had done before at a time when there was a platform for it: apply literary/cultural theory with a feminist lens to video games. All of the points she make could be gleaned from a freshman survey course on feminist and cultural theory. She also ignores the nuances in the games she criticizes and doesn't acknowledge any games with strong female leads that challenge her basic assertions about tropes and representation. If she had even half the depth, mastery of philosophical concepts and arguments and speaking prowess as you, I would STFU and golf clap.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You do realize that feminism has to be hyper-academic to counter misogynists trying to  de-legitimize it by white male elitism dominating these arenas (as proven in your correction of her French pronunciation) right?  We want to give misogynists as little reason to call us whores, dumb bitches, witches, cunts and slags, slaughter and rape us as possible.  To stick to the point and be concise enough to hold their attention with the credibility we need.  Due to your socialization, you've very likely never had to fight tooth and nail for this credibility (certainly not for stating facts for which Anita was and still is endagered in many ways), and as a result you're more comfortable taking edgy, artistic risks for mass consumption (likely not critique) and critiquing Anita's bravery for not.  I guess optics really don't matter, though, as true feminism will be smeared either way.

"I used to feel more 'meh,' toward Sarkeesian, but lately I've really come around to liking her and appreciating her work a lot more. Not everyone is a great entertainer, and I just doubt if she were more 'likable,' which is subjective, she would not be hated as much. Carolyn Petit (whom now co-hosts with her on feminist frequency radio) gave Grand Theft Auto V a 9/10 and people still wanted her fired. Brianna Wu literally didn't do anything except make a video game and people wanted to crucify her too. Popculture Detecttive, a male feminist, whom was a producer on Feminist Frequency literally does the same academic, dry critique of games and pop culture in general and his comments section is full of positive feedback.    Also, as far as I can tell she was one of the first well-known people to take online harassment seriously,  which in the wake of incel shootings and mass shootings in general was ahead of its time. Most people did not take it that seriously, back in the day, and now more people are so that's a plus. It's always kinda pissed me off how women are treated in video games too, as much as I like video games. It's cathartic to me to have someone just call the industry on its bullshit rather than throwing in some lame jokes to try and lighten the mood. It's hardly escapism, when you try to leave the real world where women and others are treated like crap to enter a fantasy where women and others are also treated like crap.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"'Why do people hate Anita Sarkeesian.' I think this deserves simplicity. There's a few reasons I can think of that Anita could be hated:  1. Anita makes bad videos or says things which are wrong. 2. Anita is made to look like she makes bad points and that she does this because of some evil intention to profiteer rather than to really forward social justice - essentially making her seem like a hollow messiah. 3. People believe in the above, and Anita isn't the straw man that's been told, but others believe it for a myriad of reasons. 4. People continue to hate Anita Sarkeesian in the face of contradictory evidence because them being fooled is a bad thing, especially amongst a culture of people who reinforce the idea of competence and shun people who are failures, basically. You must be an alpha male, because if you're not, you will be bullied by the other 'alpha males' for wrong think. 5. Fear of failure.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I know I'm a bit late to the show with this comment but fuck it why not. When you asked why people have a problem with Anita's critiques (assuming it's not based on pure misogyny), I think it has, in part, to do with the theories she uses to evaluate games, and also that her ideas have spread into the mainstream and are perpetuating some inaccurate ideas about games as an art form. Liana Kerzner makes some interesting points about this and I agree with her. Anita uses linear media theory, such as film and literature theory, rather than looking more at ludo theory. She takes ideas like the male gaze and objectification that would describe the cinematography of a film, and applies it to games. The issue with this is that it misses that games are a completely different medium from linear media. When you're playing a fighting game, you're not looking at the attractive avatar you're controlling, you're focusing on the mechanics of the game, and not getting your avatar killed.  In other kinds of games the player controls the camera, so it's up to them how sleazy they want to make the imagery on the screen. The game itself isn't encouraging any kind of objectifying imagery, it's the player. So what you'll find is that misogynistic players will do misogynistic things with the camera, whereas respectful players won't. It'd be misleading to say that games encourage misogyny purely because it allows the audience more freedom than other media. Additionally, I take issue with her saying any female character with large breasts is problematic and harmful to women, because there are women out there who have those proportions and we shouldn't body-shame them by telling them their breasts are harmful to women purely by existing in a game. If the character is treated respectfully and empowered, it shouldn't matter how they're proportioned.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Anita's style, reminiscent of a smug older sibling who's been left in charge while the parents are out isn't what really pisses people off. It's the things she gets away with that people develop blind spots for - the bitch is teflon and you can't help but resent that. I remember when she first came out she presented herself as a gamer and critic, showing a pic of her as a sprog with a SNES, but then there's that vid where she explicitly states she only recently looked at gaming, and thinks its 'gross'. Presenting yourself in different ways to gain credibility with different groups of people usually gets you marked down, but not ol' saint Anita. She pinched a bunch of gaming footage and didn't give credit (featured in those videos that got crowdfunded well over the odds), but meany heads abused their caps lock on the internet and said horrid things about her, so we'l let theft pass. Her shallow observations are based on cherry-picked examples, twisted to fit the conclusion she went in with beforehand. Add all of this to the fact she is quite happy to submit her opinions on public forums but will not defend them in any kind of exchange, then starts chatting shit about checking privilege, and you can see why the response is so visceral. Fuck that outrage peddling shyster right in the ear. She only fleeces credulous morons with more money than sense though, and turned the people that think they are opposing her into a weird sort of inverted PR machine for herself, so fair play for that part, it's a good scam she's got running.   Also Milos a twat.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Anita Sarkeesian's 'points' are often so blatantly dishonest or cherry-picked (or rather, her immediate affective response regardless of context is legitimized), her brain is so goobered with watered-down School of Resentment criticism that she claims is 'bog-standard' for media and the only way or logical conclusion of 'treating games as art'.  Is this patronizing vision the best you can manage for someone who hates her 'subculturally'? It is simply a clash of paradigms, a normier/nerd intellectual paradigm with a watered-down and badly done shitty version even of the academic feminist intellectual paradigm that does not recognize any possible opposition to itself other than being morally compromised.  The sheer disdain and disgust she and her followers had for everyone else who was not made feel good by her 'exposure of sexism' is a tragedy, really, because it is the story of unselfaware mediocrely realized elements of modern US campus feminist theory clashing with a wealth of information she tried to map on a ridiculous simplistic schema, to these people's chagrin. Especially given she never posed alternatives to the angle of interpretation or meaning ascribed to what she showed, and the misleading and out-of-context way in which she presented it.  She recieved actual harassment in response to her videos in addition to the essentially faked, true, but she always had plenty of support from without, and some or other amount of people experienced a reaction due to their misogyny.

For perspective, my main problem with Ms.Sarkeesian is also presentation. The topics discussed in her videos are necessary if Games and perhaps the people that play them are to ever grow. However, the videos I watched(and it's been a while) contained many instances of conjecture around things in the game that were purely coincidental. An example would be footage used from watch_dogs to illustrate how women are 'regarded as dolls'  and 'cease to exist as they have no significance.' In reality we have an in game model using the same 'rag-doll physics' as any other NPC and then an issue with those physics despawning the model to prevent the game from crashing. I have to wonder if this misconception is presented as humor or to deliberately mislead people.  The second issue and perhaps the bigger one, is that she presents her videos in an academic format but provides (at the time I watched at least) no citation for the videos used to demonstrate her points. This, after it's drilled into us in academia that people should always receive proper credit for their contributions to any project. It feels highly unprofessional to say the least.   It stops there though, I learned from the first few videos that I wasn't going to gain insight into ideas presented and would only find my self in the comments(which were turned off at some point?) bitterly debating the presentation and hearsay, so I moved on to other outlets for feminism.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"The big problem with Anita really is that she actually doesn't really raise good points. At times she outright lies about games but even then a lot of her points really could be described as her simply reading way too much into something, and generally something either very small or even something that's simply not there, hoping to find something because it's her personal ideology; kind of like how a conspiracy theorist can transform every mass shooting into a fake or a false flag attack by the build-a-bear group to take away everyone's guns.  Add on to that almost immediately she was given a lot of validation by the media who successfully helped her try to frame every bit of criticism towards her as angry misogynist trolls living in their mom's basement trying desperately to keep women out of games because of their own weird baggage.  Plus her personal brand of feminism involves deep adversion to violence as toxic masculinity and it's very sex negative. She almost seems to frame it from a form of misandry that people who enjoy violent video games are embracing the worst aspects of masculinity; but could you imagine if some dude-bro neck beard brust onto the scene and said he'd loved young adult romance novels but also all of them are deeply problematic because they embrace a very negative femininity where women just see men as tools to be seduced so that she can latch on to their lives and harvest them for emotional validation and money, fame, popularity, or stuff like that?  That's also another thing she did, lied about being a gamer to garner fake gamer rep so it didn't seem like she was some hokey up her own ass feminist intellectual critiquing a culture she didn't understand in the slightest while claiming to have a deep knowledge of it from her imposed framing. There's a picture of her we've all probably seen posing and smiling next to a giant stack of Xbox games but a lot of people act like you're totally absurd act like she, let alone any woman, but considering she said basically 'I hate games, who wants to play a game where you kill and there's icky gore and it's just gross' back before she was thrust into the mainstream, but suddenly once it was convenient for her she was saying she's loved and enjoyed games since she was a kid.  I think all of that WAY overshadows any actual misogyny, or at the very least I'd consider it a far more probable cause of outrage unless someone has proof to the contrary.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Her arguments are actually disingenuous and misleading, muddying the issue and making it worse, not better. She is much like the alt-right in that way, just on the other side of the fringe. The regressive left does exist, and for some reason the media likes this polarization (ratings) and have chosen Sarkeesian to be a poster girl for... well for what? Idiocity? Mediocrity at best. Attention economy I guess. She brings ratings. She appears to be an expert but isn't at all. Her work is shoddy. She should just not belong to the elite. She is an impostor, damaging to our culture.

Men don't like telling 'hilarious' jokes about raping, dominating, or humiliating women and having women not laugh.  So they blame us for having 'no sense of humor'.

Her older videos contain some attempts at humour, while newer ones generally don't.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I feel that Anita is responsible for a lot of soft headed young ladies leaving college as hate filled depressives with an inate fear and suspicion of all men. The reason why you take issue with the 'games she chooses to demonstrate her points' is because on any manner of closer examination it becomes unignorably obvious that her arguements are devoid of merit. Feminism of the brand that Anita is selling has seen women become incresingly unhappy and comes part and parcel with a greatly increased suicide rate.... This victimhood narrative which is making people like Anita rich comes at the expense of society as a whole and it becomes a downward spiral and begins to divide society as a whole, making everyone miserable.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

Sometimes more academic videos like Anita's works because they're a little bland and unoffensive. Humor and style are dependent on tastes where, at least to me, it would be harder to achieve a similar baseline. For example, my conservative father isn't receptive to videos like yours or HBomberguy's, but he'll actually empathize with the points Anita makes in her videos. Even benign humor can feel threatening to people with opposing viewpoints. But then again I'm not very familiar at all with academic feminism outside the Tube of Yous so I could just be rambling on an unrelated tangent ahaha.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

These movements all evolve from the same point: 'we are victims and you are oppressors' so they have much more authoiry than so called oppresors such as Milo. Want proof? Check first berkeley riot. Second point: Racist attack on Leslie Jones. - Why because she is black? Is it sexist also because she is a woman? You can make fun of Milo for the way he looks but he cant make fun of Leslie Jones saying that she looks like a Chimpanzee because thats racist. That by itself is racist Contra. Third point: You dont like his humor. - Who cares, we do. Fourth point: About Anita. - People like me hate her not because she critizices video games which is also something that I do all the time, we hate because she has lied, stolen content from youtube, focused on certain stereotypes whilst forgetting stereotypes such as 'men being punching bags and subjects of terrible forms of violence in videogames, etc.'.

"Honestly, as someone who recently completed a gender master's, academic feminists are some of the funniest people on the planet where they're not on the job, you know, writing dense theory papers.  True of many academics, really.  And feminist activists (not that there isn't overlap but the distinction is relevant) are already known for hilarious blog writing, even if there's something to be desired still on YouTube.  I'd love to see more riotous feminist YouTubers (especially more women), but I think it's fallacious to say that Anita's approach is less effective for lack of jokes or that she personally is responsible for expanding YouTube's feminist humour.  She's said herself that she had to stop being sarcastic because of the unbelievable levels of misrepresentation and hostility from humourless antifeminists (which, let's be real, might account for a lot of the YouTube gender imbalance), and there's an approachability, clarity, and actually a lack of accusative moralising in her content that makes it a good introduction for people 'on the fence,' as it were, or kids.  There's a place for that.  There's also a place for furry jokes, but it doesn't have to be the same place.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"A dangerous aspect of going full moral is,that some people, including me, evolve a very dark and gory humor just to survive in our society. I was born disabled and have a high tendency to gain body mass. So for the first years, till i graduaded from school, i was a fat diasbled guy listening to metal and becoming darker and darker, same as my humor. Gues what my first thoughts about feminism was? I didnt experienced any privilege, i mean, i didnt notice them while i was bullied for what I am. It is just human to take things personal, so i was very anti-feminism, because of this privilege thing (and because the first thing u get in touch with is this non logical terf-bullshit xD) And just to notice: Iam still a metalhead because the metalcommunity, at least the metal community in europe, can be a very good safe space. No bullying about my weight or my disabilites, in fact, my scars became a postiv, very trve thing,what was  very uplifiting in my teen years ^^.  Today i have no problem with feminism any more, i would just considere to care more about disabled people, because a disability changes a lot, even if ur lower body isnt affected at all. I mean, it is not that easy to fit in the picture of strong, straight male who proctects and feeds everybody if u are disabled nad it is not very helpful if feminism just pushes u in this corner and tells u about your 'male privilage' as if there is nothing that seperates u from the common society^^","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I don't think people intrinsically have a problem with her talking about video games, I think the problem is that she's trying to force pre-existing developers to change what they like and cater to what Feminists want which goes against freedom of expression. Like I said, if the state of women bother these people so much, they should go to school, learn game design, open up a business or start a kickstarter/funding page and make a video game that will cater to what they want.

"in terms of leftists/SJWs or whatever though, like we do produce a lot of content/memes and do have our own culture and sense of humour that's generally a lot more inventive than the likes of Milo. IT's still fairly out of the mainstream, but you see bits of it on large FB meme pages like Gangster Popeye, Cabbage Dog etc. and groups like Karl Marx's Dank Meme stash. A lot of trans & queer people put out a lot of good content and can be pretty 'glamorous' in their own way, and there's a lot of interesting content in Muslim internet too, just like you have black twitter etc.  But because these groups are somewhat othered people don't really go down those paths or check out there stuff so it's easy for the image of a dour leftist/feminist/SJW vs edgy Puck-like figure in Milo to persist.

"I totally agree!  I had a liberal fun killed pants half way on but you convinced me actually.  I'd never really thought of it like this.  That said I think that there is a lot of aesthi in pop feminism right now (in the forms of memes, art and literature, youtube personalities, etc: features like witches and make up artists, 'boss bitches' and 'nasty women', embrace the aesthetic side of the social movement.  This aesthetic seems to center on taking those negative things said about women and turning them around into positives.  ironically, it is sort of why people like Milo want to do, only it has a moral aspect as well), and it gets criticized, too, by being intentionally interpreted out of context and pointlessly railed against.  So then it takes it from both sides: first from the left, for not being moralistic enough, then from the right, for not being moralistic enough.  In fact, it's been the aesthi that has, arguably, been most attacked recently.  The railing against 'PC'ness etc. began with the blossoming of POC, LGBT, and feminist media in the 90's, starting in academic spheres.  It was Toni Morrison and Maya Angelou and other scholars who challenged long unchallenged aesthetics which were the targets of the particular brand of criticism which has snow balled into today alt-right movement, when inclusion of minorities is perceived as exclusion of majorities, and where anything from a non-majority perspective is considered a ridiculous assault on reality.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"They like him because he makes it safe to express their latent tendencies.  He gets their latent dicks hard.   Fully half the comments under his videos seem to be of the 'I'm not gay, but...' variety.    He's the gay jew version of the 'black guy that gets it'.  The one they can pat on the back and say, 'I normally hate n-words, but you're okay in my book.  Still, keep your distance when the race war starts, I don't want to be the one that has to shoot you.'    What I mean is, there is a (Trump voice) YUUUGE untapped market for being the gay/black/muslim/woman/etc. that's willing to say racist/homophobic/misogynist/generally shitty things about the group they happen to belong to.  Milo and his ilk are cashing in.  It's the same strategy as when totalitarian governments get a POW to make a video talking about how awful it is living in a place with plenty of food and very little government oppression. Except these pundits have no sense of integrity so they just require money and approval instead of genital torture to get them spewing propaganda.

"Well then since you seem somewhat more reasonable than the traditional Social Justice advocate that I've seen. I have a few things to say on the matter.   Anita throws in the 'You can still the play the games' style comment as a really careless and apathetic disclaimer in her videos, but you can tell through the context of the video and the way she structures her arguments that in her mind it's only there for show and doesn't speak to her actual values in the slightest.  While the complaint from the gaming community you pointed out is one that exists, I'd argue the major complaint that they have is the way that she mischaracterizes the games and manipulates the results to prove her point. She usually intentionally leaves out entire elements of games because they contradict her points. For example she throws Zelda into the captured princess trope, but for anyone who's actually played the game they know that while in the earlier games that may have been the case from OOT moving forward she typically plays a prominent roll in the game and in some games like Wind Waker she fights alongside you in the final battle. A fair critique that doesn't misrepresent the facts is what gamers are asking for.   There is also the issue of how she got hundreds of thousands of dollars to make this project and promised it on a schedule, but despite it being standard youtube video material she's WAYYYYY behind that schedule and is now begging for money on a new project when she hasn't finished this project...it seems very unprofessional to me and any reasonable person would have doubts about her authenticity. Maybe I'm wrong, but if you're being honest you have to admit it does seem at least a bit sketchy, doesn't it?    ONWARD TO MILO!  I actually despise Milo. I thought he was reasonable back during GG, but as time has gone on his true colors have bled through and now I cannot stomach him in the slightest. He's an obnoxious troll who goes around messing with people for entertainment purposes and brings nothing of substance or value to the table, but will act like he's the greatest thinking mind of the century.   He also claims to hate identity politics, yet he'll never shut up about how gay he is and often times uses his identity as either a weapon or a method of defense when going after others. Honestly I consider him the right wing version of the SJW's because he's really no better and he's just as intellectually dishonest if not more so.     Side note:  You as a person are...interesting.   I can't quite pin down what I think of you yet, being as this is the second video of yours I've seen so far. You've got a really weird sense of humor that's sometimes jarring for me, however, you do make fair points and you seem reasonable as opposed to many other people around so I can let our slight differences in comedic taste pass I suppose.    *noticed the upload date on this video*  Oh well might have wasted my time on this...ah well Fuuuuuuuck it","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"You know, I have no issue with what Anita says. I don't agree with her idea that games SHOULDN'T have the characters she doesn't like rather than saying there should be more games with DIFFERENT characters. But I fully stand by her right to say it. And the rifht of people to criticize her for it. I very rarely agreed with Milo. I did follow him and I didn't dislike him, but he did fully deserve his ban. For me he was more a... grounder.  Milo did something I dislike a lot... he attacked the person rather than the argument. Much like most those on the far left and the far right, he cared more about WHO you are rather than what you have to say. I have little respect for people that try to shut down an argument because the person speaking is male or female, gay or straight, black or white, religious or Atheist, fat or thin, conservative or liberal, feminist or not... and BOTH sides are guilty of doing this.  TL;DR: Attack the argument, not the person.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It used to be that she'd release a video and I'd disagree with about 40-50% of it. Now it's only about 5%.

"I really think that Milo is doing some kind of bizarre performance art. I would say that dismissing him as a mere troll, as some people often do, gives him less credit than he deserves. I think a big part of his plan is to admonish the world for being too sensitive--with the underlying implication that over-sensitivity is harmful to the world, (which is an idea that I identify with personally) in a way similar to Lenny Bruce. However, unlike Bruce, Milo seems to think that the rules don't apply to him. Playing a character that is a scumbag is one thing, but being a dick in your everyday public life to any and everyone you meet is just not a thing I can get behind.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Honey, the reason I, and many other people have come to despise Anita Sarkeesian is because she has been proven to be intellectually dishonest.  It's not just her character that is flawed but the feminist school of thought from which she has derived her self-contradicting and pretentious criteria for what constitutes as a 'problematic/sexist' element in video games.  Watch TL;DR's video of his adaptation of Anita's criticism applied to her own female protagonist concept.  She explicitly states in the first episode of Tropes versus Women that intended or unintended portrayals of what we perceive in media affects the way we behave towards others in real life.  She is using this scientifically unsubstantiated blanket statement as an inference that video game developers are encouraging the men who play their games to become hateful and/or distrustful of women.  It is no wonder that she gets all the deserved backlash from people who have seen right through her misguided attempts at trying to improve society by way of mistaking a cause for leading to an effect.  That being said, you have made a well-edited video and you look aesthetically pleasing in drag.

"It might not be the case with Anita but sometimes I think feminists don't have a sense of humour because they don't want the backlash from certain anti-feminists.   ie. The 'You made a very clear joke that you believe all women should embrace their furry self, how DARE YOU, you can't force being a furry on all women, you just admitted feminism isn't about equality anymore' comments.  What I mean is many feminists want to distance themselves of the tragically ingrained stereotype of feminists being angry, overbearing and scary, that they act deliberately overly calm and simply explain things without humour to try and dispel the stereotype and appeal to people's intellect.  Kind of wearing 'look I'm a calm feminist!' badge.

"The thing is, you only consider milo to be morally lacking becasue you have a warped sense of morality. If you think Anita is the epitome of moral behavior you are sorely mistaken. Antia wants to constrain women into an imaginary mould that she has built up through her years of feminist indoctrination from taking the words of radical feminists like bell hooks without a single grain of salt.  She bases her morality on the imaginary construct of white supremacist, capitalist, patriarchy, and says that the only way to be moral is to oppose this imaginary structure. In reality, white supremacy is not a view held or advocated for by the vast majority of western society. In fact only a few fringe groups still hold beliefs that white people are inherently superior to other races, and whenever anyone advocates these views publicly, they are typically derided as the racists and bigots they are. Likewise for anyone who advocates any sort of male supremacy or 'patriarchy'. in fact the only element of this construct that can be shown to exist is capitalism, and true capitalism is not something that should be opposed. Capitalism is how you are able to make videos and how i can make comments. It is the basis for every right any of us has to own anything and work to become anything. Adam Smith explains it in it's entirety  in 'the wealth of nations'. read it and you will see how ignorant marx was.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Milo was not borderline racist. The worst thing he said to leslie jones was a mocking joke after she blocked him, comparing her to a black man who had rejected him. It is a well known fact that milo sleeps almost exclusively with black men, so If anything that comment was a comment on her attractiveness and not her race. Now of course it wasn't very nice of him but it is far from the accusations many people have thrown at him. Such as his being responsible for the harassing actions of other users. in reality this whole controversy was just the most expedient excuse twitter could find to kick him off their network. The fact that twitter has had a grudge against milo became readily apparent when they took away his verification badge, making it apparent that a tool originally meant to identify public individuals from their imposters has become a tool used for dealing out ideological wrist slaps toward people with the 'wrong' opinions. If they wanted to punish milo for something he said they should have banned him then, but they couldn't do that becasue then they would have had to tell him what twitter rules he broke to evoke such a sentence, as they vaugely did when they eventually did ban him.  Twitter has claimed to be a free speech platform in the past, but it is now run by idealogues hellbent of thought policing anyone with dissident opinions.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

And on both sides, what i find the most dangerous is this will of purity, that minds must be cleanse of any fantasy of violence in art, and at the same time from the anti sjw pov, public or private law of any reasonable restraint. In the end, i prefer Anita because like you said at least she has some sort of substance in what she says, while the Milo team is all about empty rhetoric and nitpicking statistics, without any kind of positive discourse besides justifying the status quo and for whom the ultimate artistic gesture would be voting for Donald Trump.

"(If it matters I'm firmly against SJW, and New Feminist and New Democrats (Bar good guys like Sanders). I supported Obama over the many Republicans except for Ron Paul which amounted to nothing in the end. I've supported gay marriage since I can remember and have always been deeply pro-trans rights. I still get shaking my head at Milo and Conservatives when they talk about social issues. But its almost weird to say the same disgruntledness I feel for them I get from Democrats and the 'movement')  What I find strange is that either side sees themselves as reactionary or against the system. The other the established or some cult. Scrolling through the comments of your videos and even some of your own points I noticed the trend of forming a anti-social justice league and even people saying anti-feminist. This seems to have upkicked and whats even stranger is I see some assumption that gah! All these channels against it(SJW crap)! It to me shows a cognitive dissonance. You realize many of these channels if not all were motivated by the constant bombardment and corrupted mainstream media right or the religious right? That the reactionary movement isn't what is puppeteered in the mainstream. In fact rarely do I see any creator that is of independence not towing some SJW narrative or points of contact.  Its constant. The establishment quote unquote is on your side and the fight is against a reactionary movement to a new found push. The term feminist has become widely unpopular within recent years not due to mainstream reporting but to independent sources and outliers. Recently conservatives have gotten the tip of the hat and started backing the reactionary movement and now I would think seems entrenched apart of the conservative movement. I think all should remember many of us hate Republicans and conservatives just as much as the new democrat push. Just before this onset of SJW the same people were viciously fighting the dogma of Republicans and I'd never ever in 2012 thought I'd have been so violently pushed to supporting Republicans more then the traditional democratic side. It seems this reality is so easily forgotten by many on the other camp. The many youtubers are the same who went after Christians and their shit. I still cringe like fuck and roll my eyes when I hear by gods light! This group or at least a large..large section is atheist-secular liberals and pro gay+trans rights and oh...a lot very socialist. The commoness is very diced and close..so my point in this is you should remember that a torch has been carried into what many think is Marxist, Fascist lands.  People like me who supported Obama through the internet in both 08 and 12 when it came down to two. We aren't the conservative hit pieces or some group or cultist ideology. But a reaction to this push forward. Its a reactionary movement versus a establishment press forward along with the many people following on its dog tail. You can claim all you want you are promoting progressive and positive ideas and reacting against the system or changing things for the better...but remember all you are fucking doing is social engineering with a corrupted establishment. There's too much to swallow with just that alone for me to ever support the democrats again. Its just as dogmatic and corrupt as Republicans. Trump might win because of this. So my point here is realize that this is a reactionary group that's hardly unified besides sharing collabs and simply being a apart of a trend. Its not something entrenched with a variety of News publications the entire Democratic party and the support of the President and among other things. You guys should understand the side you are on. A side rittled in with the establishment while the reactionaries would be thrown out in the cold. This is just one of the serve issues I find with a lot of your categorizing of these people. Milo is simply a ally to many of us because he supports what we so vilify. Hate him/love him. He's smart. He's cunning and he's hurting your movement. Watch any time he's on with someone else..agree or disagree with his logic he dominate conversations. So to the many who hate him remember he's not a idiot and you should take him seriously despite all of the retarded things I've heard him say. This is precisely why Trump is popular also. In the end of this little off shoot I'm just saying this movement can't be disreguarded as some group or collective of 'shitlords' Its a reaction to your ideas. Not a proaction. Its people who you formerly voted with and supported in debate drawing a line in the sand. Know your enemy or you won't beat them.    Besides that I love all of your videos Contra. Vehemently disagree with the logic sometimes+Am a shitlord. You are good at what you do and have sound and honest logic that I rarely see and can't help but roll my eyes at how basic bitch it is. Keep pouring them out.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think you're miss-understanding Milo, or perhaps you're just looking for the wrong kind of substance. And that's not your fault honestly, I can totally understand why a lot of people don't get the Milo thing. I certainly agree with a lot of your criticisms of him.  From what I've seen Milo isn't fighting the battle of ideas with words and debates as people normally would. He's provoking people to show the worse side of their ideologies and biases so even if you disagree with what Milo said or did you still come off questioning the other side of the argument.  When Milo says mean things to people on Twitter and gets banned for it, I think most people (including myself) dislike what he did. But then that often leaves you asking, should people be banned for saying mean or politically incorrect things to someone online? Because as someone who's said mean and controversial things online I don't think it should.  Perhaps it's similar to how people protest by walking around naked. I think a lot of people would find it at the very least distasteful for someone to do such a thing. But on the flip-side you still need to question whether people really should be banned from showing their natural bodies if they wish.  Anyway, I think it would be nice to see someone try to bridge the divide between these ideologies on YouTube and the internet in general. If we use the example of feminism for a moment, I think people on both sides of the argument agree with the idea of equality and equal rights. They just differ in approach, probably because of a difference in the facts they've been presented with and their experiences. Someone who can fairly question the experiences and 'facts' being used by both sides of the argument may make the exchange of ideas a little more reasonable and productive.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Oh here we go again... Yet another fucking video where you dress up like a bloody girl and make me question just how straight I really am!  Serial though, great video! This along with videos today from libertarian socialist rants and hbomberguy have made for a well distracted hangover day. Good to see you guys collabing too. In general actually, for the longest time youtube feminism was either over-simplistic 101's from incredibly dull talking heads treating their audience like children with marketing inspired editing and scripts, or it was bedroom ramblings into a PS5 webcam that centred more around drama, attention seeking and lying.  Now we are getting either highly edited, hilarious, self aware, honest and informative performances from channels such as your own, or less entertaining but more in depth channels such as Garrett and chrisiosity that aren't concerned with claiming that other feminist youtubers are sexual predators, for attention. Basically, it's a good time to be a feminist on youtube! Plus, it's really starting to make the anti-fem part of youtube look tired, ideological and uninformed, as it should do.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"In my opinion the best point of Anita Sarkeesien is to show how lame the design of female characters in video games has been. It calls out those lazy game developers who just repeat stereotypes. The problem is that it seems she knows not much about video games herself and her way of showing it is oversimplifying important nuances. It might be good for a lay audience, but obviously not for hardcore gamers, who happen to be anti-left anyway.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The list goes on.   I personally don't like her because she's in it for the money and that's why you won't find any heart or soul in her videos and before you ask; No my wiener want none of her mustard.

"Moral is not just one position, but has many different aspects to it, and I simply don't share many of the moral values Anita has, they look to me mostly just like fascism... and that feeling just gets enhanced by her choice to make videos that feel like propaganda. On the other side, Milo is also not really to my taste, sure he brings up often enough good counter arguments against the feminist position, but the values he holds dear are also questionable. So, instead of seeing either or both as any kind of role model, I find both to be crappy. Luckily, I don't think I have to decide for either or have to make them mesh, but believe there are options that lie completely outside of the narratives they follow.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
