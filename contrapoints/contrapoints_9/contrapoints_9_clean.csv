"I have a degree in philosophy, and another degree in anthropology, but in all honesty, I didn't become a leftist until arguing with 'libertarians' and anarcho-capitalists on the internet.  What a shock it was to realize that they don't actually believe in freedom. At least, they don't believe in freedom for anyone other than the wealthy owners of land and natural resources. Everyone else has no choice but to sign over all of their freedom and individuality for someone else's profit, just so that they can have access to the basic necessities of life. It is all just so that they can survive.  But land and natural resources are naturally accessible to anyone. Why should any one individual have exclusive owenership of it at the expense of others? How is that right maintained? You see, the only way for it to be maintained is through a system of coersive government. By limiting the freedom of others to live, they preserve their own freedom and 'right' to exploit others for their own private benefit.  The wealthy make profit, using our labor and our bodies to do so, and all we get out of the involuntary deal is to continue living, and to continue working, for them. There is no alternative, so how could it be voluntary? Not only that, but the people we work for are the same people we must pay in order to continue living. They pay us less than the value of the products we produce, and then they turn around and sell those same products right back to us for more than we were paid to produce them. The products we produce and the products we buy are the same, and never do we truly benefit. All of the benefit goes to the wealthy. This is exploitation.  There is no choice but to give others authority over ourselves, when individuals have the right to own land and natural resources. We would starve without them to sustain us. We are entirely dependent on them. Yet, they have sole power to determine our fates. We are not in charge of our own lives or llivelihoods we rely on people whose only purpose is to make profit for themselves. They don't care about their workers. The workers are useful tools for them. They are replaceable. Of course, it is not so easy for the workers who have been replaced and who have no money to sustain their lives with.  The wealthy are free to live in luxury precisely because no one else is free at all. I never knew this before engaging in debate online, and I've read Marx many times. It's definitely valuable. But it's also valuable to be educated in philosophy. It only arms you against the ignorant. Knowledge is power, just like money is.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"As a former college grad. who went to public schools in the state of Virginia and in a very conservative bible belt area. On average, I would say community colleges tend to be more right-winged and conservative than the mid to large sized universities in the region. The small sized universities (at least the one I went to my first year of college ever was more right-winged and conservative. I was a sociology major at the mid-sized school I eventually went to but I will say on average and in comparison to the famous liberal universities in America, it was  moderate to relatively liberal. When I went there in my late 20s and early 30s, it seriously changed my world view.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I am currently a research fellow at a university in the UK. I am on a stipend (paid by a separate body from the university) that is lower than minimum wage in my own home country, oh and I get paid quarterly. Last year a fellow academic needed a serious operation, against the rules of my funding agency I was gaslighted into undertaking their teaching load, teaching a third if a unit, including marking, for free. This saved the university at least PS2000 pounds if the had to pay somebody else.  This was caught by a couple of the professors as exploitative and when raised with the head of school, they said they couldn't pay.  Beware opaque administrative nuances between universities. When I first started I had no phone and my luggage was lost on a non-work trip, using my office phone I apparently ranked up a PS100 bill tracking that down, no sympathy, I was forced to pay back. Lately I was on a work trip, my old uni was cashless and photos of are receipts were fine, this uni however wanted the actual receipts of which I was missing a few. I had to personally ware that loss.   They took me for a ride for thousands but couldn't bat PS50 pounds for me. Stay away from academia.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I found this video relatable and comforting. That may not have been your intention, but I thought it was worthwhile to let you know that your honesty is deeply appreciated.   I'm currently a psychology PhD student, all but dissertation, and I find myself absolutely drowning in insecurity and teetering on the brink of depression daily because (1) I can't muster the motivation to write as often as everyone insists I should, (2) I don't think I can (or have adequate desire to) compete in the ever-more-competitive research world, (3) and I don't think I can get a satisfying or prestigious academic job once I graduate. The worst part is that I don't feel like I can tell my adviser because there's a heavy stigma associated with leaving academia, and I suspect that my remaining social and professional resources would be pulled if I expressed anything other than a masochistic devotion for my research. And to top it off, academia is this weird paradoxical place--a bastion of liberal values and simultaneously a socially acceptable good old boys club--where poor quality of life for graduate students (e.g., poor pay for tons of work, a culture of silence surrounding the report of workplace-related sexual assault, rampant depression and anxiety) is often the norm. My pessimism is palpable, and my desire to leave is second only to my own all-consuming guilt at the idea of being a quitter who couldn't hack it in my field.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I studied Philosophy outside the US, and I must tell you I was really surprised by the way your education around it works after I participated in a Symposium in Boston. I met some recently accepted into PhD students. It striked me deeply that you only spend 2-3 years of college with just a major in Philosophy. The quantity of courses (because you dont even have philosophy courses only) and the duration of the career is so short I doubt you come out prepared to pursue a PhD, or even to know what you're getting into. In my country you have to enter straight up to philosophy, and the undergraduate curriculum is a 4 year cycle with just philosophy courses. You also have to write a 100 pages thesis, so after you come out you are already able to write extensively and boringly. I saw, IMO ,many inexperienced children with the habits of an old man at just 21, very serious approach and really great grades but completely stripped of the passionate and heated debate (PC shit, and I was treated well because im latino lol). Sincerely, super high academic standards (grades,teaching assistance and what else), but boring philosophical discussion (trivial hiper complex stuff).  I don't think my country is any good in philosophy anyway, but I understand why you guys get so frustrated by it. I found it very isolating and boring and boujee.

"i knew it, or something. i've been pretty cynical of higher education. it started in yr5-6 of UK education 2004-2005, a small group of us got taught like a one off guest biology lesson by a chemistry phd. first year of 2ndary school i see them again i say 'hi dr hamilton!' like a chirpy little 11yr old and she ignored me and walked off, i don't remember what kid-me thought of that, i dont know what adult me thinks of it either. through all of 2ndary school, you put in no effort, get good grades, and get asked about what you want to do when you leave school, i didnt know, i still dont know. so i did a-levels i did all sciences and maths, im super pissed about this now because apparently the education system, media, brian cox admitted they have had programs in place to make these more popular, and i did every single one. i like art. you just think to do science cos it'll make you money, and they're kinda cool, and it'll justify being bullied and whatever else. but we got taught by another chemistry phd dr goulding, and this one told stories: 'everything you learn in university, u just need it for the exam, then u can tear it all down, you don't need it' and in that same year we got taught by my favourite person ever and im going to cry. he taught maths, we were his last class ever before his retirement, his was name ben singleton, after he moved to france with his wife, he told us he wrote a book and wanted to show it us and that someone gave it a review just to self-advertise their book. oh my god, and he told us that when he went to university, the state paid him, and that people predicted because of computers they'd be able to work half the amount of time, now we're sat there looking at 45k loans so we can live a normal life and retire to france and write a book no ones gonna read. i dont think i let him down, that was the only class i did any revision for, that was the only the one i cared about. the world let him down. i love the world so much, it's so cool, but it's so fucked. im crying so much. now half the people i've met on twitch are phd students or computer science majors. you need a degree to be a policeman. something happened, tv happened, could be anything, i dont want to speculate. 45k for school, and it could all be online anyway, i thought there was no way that; fuck about, dont care, called a bad influence by the other chemistry teacher, would ever take any of the opportunities to make going to university worth it. u go into a university lecture hall, you see a whole class of 20 people, that's so much money, you could legitimately take a 45k loan and move to bulgaria live in complete comfort and never have to do anything ever again. i dont want to talk about mental health, but youtube is so easy to be in, being there for all of gamergate,milo, lauren southern, tim pool and jordan peterson is like, i dont remember arguing for them, i sat and watched it, i couldn't justify the hero shit. thank fuck for nigel farage, a man so stupid he argued live on tv that '300million people could come from europe and flood the uk' imagine a province in china or the US arguing that, biggest frauds on the planet, thank fuck for brexit, the clarity how easy it is to vote remain, imagine a deal where your idealist version of freedom is worth ripping off everything and destroying a country for 40 years. i was there from like gamergate 2014 to march 2018 when i quit petersons god bless chomsky, thanks mr singleton. i think im gonna go apologise to anita for helping those channels that made it big on the back of it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Holy fucking Jesus, I wish I could like this video more times. I'm just wrapping up a semester where I (a practically minded art student) took both an upper level critical theory, AND philosophy class. I barely survived. The critical theory in particular, dear god. The philosophy was kinda fun, just exhausting and pointless. The theory though... I've never been in a class where I've have such total contempt for the subject matter. I tried to argue with the proff a few times based on how absurd this stuff was when applied to the real world, but apparently that's not a valid criticism. Without that, there was no point of contact for me to even engage with that nonsense.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"That's why you should've treat philosophy as your 'vitamin C pill'. It 'could' strengthen your intellectual sharpness, but you could live without it. Instead, I would rather take a more practical program that is approachable from philosophy perspective, and vice versa. I'm a master grad on human rights and democratization. Not that much practical and its job market is quite shallow. Hence, I took another course that's more practical yet coinciding with human rights, ECONOMICS. I focused on issues like HDI, poverty policy, and corporate responsibility which are more appealing for job market.   If I intended to be judgmental here, I think you were just quite naive, which ISN'T WRONG AT ALL, but again, naive. You took academic degree as if you conflated your quest of truth with basically, 'how to be not worrying your financial sustainability?'. Yeah, philosophy courses seem very captivating with its 'quest'. But, it's guaranteed that you'd be facing a harsh reality of how unrealistic philosophy is and yet, remains financially, mentally, and intellectually proud to be 'meh', hence your video here.   P.S. Don't your eyes got hurt looking at the camera like that? Your eye muscles must be tired then.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"so strange to see contra from a few years ago. still great, though, and as always makes almost too much sense. i had a similar experience with literally the only philosophy class i have ever taken. the biggest problem was how he'd shut down certain moral codes, by saying they'd make something he viewed as immoral, moral. i'm a computer science major, so i'm more used to prove things in more concrete ways but that just seemed way too far even considering it's philosophy. for example: saying that utilitarianism could justify genocide, which is immoral and thus it is a flawed system. but like... you're using your own moral code to deem it immoral. i'm not saying genocide is moral, but that just seems like a bullshit way to shut down an ethical theory. or his most recent 'immoral' thing to use to disprove ethical theories, abortion. and then he does this cocky bullshit 'and that's okay? i don't think so' and has this smug ass smirk. so glad to only have two more weeks.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I had a history prof who was present when Japan surrendered in WWII, but by the time I encountered him, couldn't make it to a single afternoon class sober. I had a Public Relations prof who worked on both the Nixon and Reagan campaigns and spent most of the course trying to convince us that lying, and influencing opinion through deception were two different things. I had an economics prof from Japan whose English pronunciation was so bad that nobody could understand him. I took a 'Dynamics of Leisure' course mostly for easy credit, and it sooo was! I took bowling for my phys-ed requirement, where we were graded on our scores, so by unspoken agreement, everybody cheated. And I had an academic advisor who told me that knowledge was its own reward and not merely for financial gain; to which I replied that without financial gain, nobody could pay tuition and gain knowledge.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Had noone in that graduate political philosophy seminar read G. A. Cohen or Charles Taylor, or it wasn't on a provided reading list?! I mean, I teach my undergrads that. If you want piercing and detailed critiques of libertarian thought, there's plenty of good stuff about! (I'm sure you know that by now, of course, if not back then.) I'm sure plenty of philosophy and political theory departments in the anglophone academic world aren't very well-versed in left critiques of the right, as you suggest. But (1) I'm unsure that's the rule and is likely to be a trend; and (2) I don't think you could use this claim (that political philosophers are generally unconcerned to engage right-wing thinking) to show that they're predominantly left-wing. At best I think it demonstrates a prevalent liberalism which is economically very central and socially not far from the libertarians. It's one of the many annoying things about the 'IDW' types that they castigate liberal thinking as far-left when often it is much closer to their own position, while critical left thought is barely even touched.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I doubt Queen C will ever see or read this, but I'm still going to write this all out. This  is like listening to my intellectual doppelganger...I too majored in Neuro and Philosophy in undergrad (in fact I at one point was so full of the ridiculous idealism and optimism of youth that I wanted to TRIPLE major in neuro, philosophy and psychology and develop this 'comprehensive understanding of consciousness' lawl) went grad school (but for neuropharm, maybe I wouldn't have lost it if I went with philosophy...) subsequently got super depressed, fell into a dark hole, crawled out, went to med school, realized that the healthcare system in this country is fucking broken, and now trying to get my CFA to go into fintech so I can eventually maybe work with large scale biotech investing. Oh how far I've fallen. And yet, that's the whole thing right? You don't realize just how little your career actually matters to the world and just how little it, in turn, gives a shit about you, until it's far too late. Some people never realize it.   So, in some ways, I've just reached a point of clarity with myself and acknowledge that the best way to do anything and/or change anything on a grand scale nowadays is to have a FUCKTON of money. Nothing else matters right now, with the only other thing worth amassing in this world being fucking Twitter (or YouTube har har) followers, which can also, of course, be leveraged into money.  Academia, like the rest of the world in 2019, is not a place for someone with any type of empathetic connection to their fellow man/woman/person, nor for someone who wants to actually change anything on a grand scale.  By the by, I was one of those little AP shits in high school, which allowed me to skip a bunch of intro classes right away my freshman year of college, and I ended up taking 'French Existentialism' as my first real philosophy course after Ethics (hah!).

"My two cents on college here as Philosophy major at UC. Sociological standpoint mostly focuses on intersectional feminism and conflict theory, which creates more and more division we see in identity politics -- staying 'woke' about the many levels of oppression. (Jordan Peterson's perspective might be more 'functionalist', which was mentioned as the intro when sociology was created, but dismissed nowadays) Our Law department was more reasonable, regulating for the sake of quality and purity in regards to working conditions and drugs -- however, we also focused on income inequality without really considering income mobility and stories of successful immigrants from a conservative researcher like T. Sowell. We did go over Robert Nozick, but only for Wilt Chamberlain argument and Experience Machine, and Rawls instructor said 'This guy, young, smart, ugh.' And of course, relying on super-utopian Rawls 'pure procedural' counterargument to Nozick, I guess. Sociology prof. slept w every race of men and had 5 kids from different fathers, 4 on autism spectrum, said 'aww are you all still virgins' to crowd. Only real neutral professor was Psychology and Law I would say, he said he disliked B. Clinton as well as Trump, I suppose.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Haha, I once was a physics PhD and this is really relatable. As a physicist, you spend your studies learning about all kinds of marvelous things about how the world works with atoms and black holes and whatever. Then, for you PhD, you have to study some obscure perturbation of a theory applied to a material that will maybe be used someday in a detector to find marvellous properties of matter, but maybe not, we don't know. So yeah, it's not at all trying to find new exciting theories and ways to understand the world, it's just boring sh*t. In a lot of ways, it is a scientific 'Chmess'. All of that in the hope a permanent physicist role which one person in 50 will get. So I was bored for a while, I also experienced the power of being a teacher, which was the only fun part, then I got the f*ck out and now I do whatever I want and I'm on Youtube too.

At one particularly prestigious tournament, I had the pleasure of having a round judged by a 'good friend of Derrida'. Before the round he told me quite a bit about their relationship and his fondness of Derrida's theories. At this point, my walnut brain thought 'Aha! If I read my Derrida kritik, I'll surely win since neither my opponent nor I will know what I'm saying, but this guy will be forced to give me the win since my opponent will drop all my arguments!'  So I attempted that. Then I realized that I looked like a dumbass when my opponent asked me wtf I was saying. Then I realized that even with the direct citations from Derrida my judge didn't even know what the fuck I was saying. How many... Actually do?

"People on the right wing in the united states are not encouraged to do any kind of social research or academia. I have peers that told me to die because they think I'm 'dangerous,' when in actuality, I simply see the world differently and I have no ill will toward any person, just like them. My goal is to improve the average quality of life for all people, regardless of socioeconomic status or race or anything like that. I want to see exactly where freedom and equality can come into opposition, and what we can do to create opportunities for all members of society to pursue a satisfying life. I was lucky to have read both kinds of literature through high school due to a teacher who took great interest in an unbiased education for his students.    However, every single piece of literature made after 1975 I received from a university professor as class material has been washed in left-wing political jargon. Once, freshman year, I was asked to read, annotate, and discuss a series of articles of my choosing from a reputable sociology journal as a class assignment. We all showed up to class, ready to have a discussion about some complex issues raised in our papers and articles we chose, having sent them in an email to our professor. She looked over our articles and said: 'these are nice, but I think this series of articles would be a lot better.' The articles she supplied were from The Chicago Tribune, Washington Post, and New York Times, with the headline 'Democracy Dies In Darkness.' That was when, in real time, I was realizing that the search for knowledge would be one of the hardest things I've ever done. I learned that many do not go into academia to learn and help others but to shamelessly, selfishly defend a single way of thinking in any way possible, even if it means resorting to misinformation. I am a flawed person like anyone else, but I cannot see that as justification to behave selfishly.    'Academics' have bastardized liberal arts into a justification for supposing theory that isn't based on logic or mathematics and 'thinking for the sake of thinking.' If I wanted to think in a vacuumed echo-chamber for the rest of my life, without considering an application for the theory, I would have chosen philosophy as my concentration. I am a scientist who studies humans and their behavior, and how they form groups, based on observable evidence, history, and statistics. I don't want knowledge withheld from me. The more knowledge I have, the better I am able to draw conclusions from the research, and those results matter. So while everyone else is still debating whether or not results can be expected, I will produce results. I will not be held down by ideas like religion or personal outlook.  I will not consider the perspective of pseudosciences, and I won't consider any emotional or relativistic ideas. This isn't to say I don't have them, but I have to understand that my own biases or anyone else's have no place in my work. I'm tired of hearing about the things we can't solve. I'm tired of making excuses and running around in ethical, spiritual, or political loops about phraseology or fundamental disagreements. All of these seem to distract from the purpose of all of this: creating a higher quality society for us to live in.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I personally lacked the freedom to delve into issues more deeply, because if I had an unpopular opinion, I was immediately shut down.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"History major here. I can absolutely relate with the frustration. I went in as a guy with a really deep passion and understanding of European history from Ancient Greece to the fucking Jacobites in Scotland. It was just what I nerded out for. My family raised me on celluloid and old movies based around romanticized historical topics. That eventually developed to a scholarly interest.  Then I got to higher education. Every history major and their mother is a shallow 20th century historian with the same five opinions and conversations are basically around those points. They all thought I was smarter than them even though I was certain these guys were much more effective researchers and writers than me just because I knew stuff they didn't. Now I'm more focused on American history overall but, yea. It's frustrating in America that very rarely did I ever meet someone with as much of a passion for my focus until I switched to American history. My face lights up any time I meet a student who's a history major that isn't all up Rommel's ass.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I still believe that despite the levels of education and beliefs, people are in general moderate, but the far right is convincing moderate fellows with stuff like freedom of expression and political incorrectness, although if we were to see leftists mostly want just basic human rights (something everybody wants!) .. Idk. I'm very happy with your existence, even the melancholyc humour I feel I can connect with. You are almost a political incorrect leftist haha.  I also love the way you talk - strange comment, but hey English is not my mother tongue, so it's awesome to practice listening good eloquent vocabulary with you. I think you found a great way to debate, with a level of conversation that invites a serious discussion instead of doing reactionary shit that polarizes people.

"What you say about left-wing circles in academia is sadly true here in Germany as well - but of course, there are also fairly right-wing academic circles. I know Universities on both sides of the ocean, and it's not different in Chicago either, so this isn't a purely German phenomenon. As I see it, both the left-wing circles and the right-wing circles don't really interact with each other. I know right-wing academics that are just as helpless when debating me as a left-winger as most of my fellow left-wing academics are at debating right-wingers. When I even mention that I'm a Marxist, I usually get bombarded with a fuckton of cliches that are ridiculously easy to refute. As I see it though, this doesn't even have anything to do with them being right-wing. As you rightly pointed out, left-wing academics are largely the same. I think it has to do with the academic system itself. At least on some level, it promotes 'networking' based on personal and theoretical sympathy, and this leads to the development of closed theoretical circles that tend to stick to themselves and barely interact with each other. In Philosophy, this doesn't only run along the political divide, but also along a bunch of other divides, e.g. analytic philosophy vs. classical (or 'continental') philosophy, different schools of thought (Kantianism vs. Hegelianism vs. analytical naturalism is a strong divide at my university here in Germany, for example), etc. - but of course, the political divide always is a strong dividing force (in the US admittedly more so than in Germany). As you said, students are also encouraged to specialize to a ridiculous extent, which furthers the development of these circles.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's not academia's fault that you specifically chose a field of study that is not designed to have direct practical implications. I mean, I did a BA in philosophy in a department that is generally considered to expect near-MA level work out of its undergrads and I loved the MotherF-ing shit out of it and considered going further in the subject, but I knew in my heart of hearts that spending my life in philosophy would amount to little more than an exercise in narcissism. Not to say that it's bad, I have friends who are now philosophy professors and I respect and adore them. But because I actually took half a fucking second to think about the implications of which field of study I chose in the end, I went to grad school based on my second major, economics. I am still doing graduate work in development economics and I am doing paid consulting work in development research. I am in academia as an academic. This warped view that you portray, while less intense than the portrayals of the right-wing trolls, is (a) not universally true in the fields in which it does sometimes exist, and (b) unique to fields with no direct practical implications.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

For better or worse (usually worse, and he himself was an Econ major so he's talking smack about his own field rn lol) economists are seen as the 'wizards' of the 21st century, policy alchemists that no one can question unless you too have an economics degree, politics after all, is very aesthetic and sociology doesn't have a great one especially in America. It's even more bs cus most recent sociology programs require you to study statistical analysis and economics, but alas even a brilliant sociologist with insightful work will immediately just get written off as a 'communist' before they can even make their argument. Fine, I told him, then l'll make sure to major in economics and become a professional economist to pay my bills as I try to bring about the revolution.

"I'm a bit underwhelmed by this case against academia. I've heard that philosophy is especially bad in terms of its professionalization, but CP's point here seems to be that none of it matters: that academics are just discovering ever higher order of chmess (or however the quote went). But this assumes a kind of empiricist view of what academia 'should' be about. I keep expecting CP to say something like 'But what is The Truth of the matter?' There is no 'The Truth of the matter' to a lot of these questions: the discourses themselves are what matter, and historical and philosophical discourses are a big part of what shapes both collective and individual identity. Again and again I hear CP say 'but none of this matters to normal people' or something like that. Yeah, actually, it does, because academia is a major institution that plays a huge role in shaping our understanding of the world, whether we are aware of it or not. In the words of historian Keith Jenkins, 'received academic wisdom has a privileged place.' Just because you might not *feel* like you are doing something important doesn't mean you aren't.   I'm not saying this to idealize academia. i'm a PhD student and I have my complaints too. But to think that the 'real debate' happens on youtube sounds a bit hyperbolic to me. Does CP seriously think that the false narratives about 'SJWs' etc. conjured by Sargon of Akkad and other rightist cronies constitute some kind of meaningful intellectual field where academia does not?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"From what it sounds like, you really toured the wrong corners of philosophy given your interests. The topics/schools you're describing all seem to be in the Continental and/or historical corner of philosophy.   Unfortunately, Analytic philosophy (broadly construed) is arguably the only subschool of philosophy serious about finding out how the world works from a broadly naturalistic and scientific perspective. Had you had the chance to study philosophical logic, philosophy of language, contemporary ethics, the philosophy of quantum mechanics, or contemporary analytic philosophy of mind, instead of Derrida, Foucault, or Aristotle, maybe you wouldn't have lost your patience with philosophy so quickly.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"It's taken me four years to slog through the first two years of my degree in English, and the majority of the classes I've had that were actually relevant to my major have been taught by professors with heads so far up their asses they think the real world has functioned the same way since they were in grad school in '89. Most recently, I had an Intro to Lit professor who, when he wasn't teaching our class the same literary analysis terminology I'd been taught in my 8th grade English class, was constantly waxing philosophical about the selected readings he'd so lovingly handpicked from an anthology that cost myself and my fellow classmates approximately $250 of the government's hard-stolen cash that was loaned to me so as to ensure I die penniless as well as alone. It's important to note that every single piece he selected from this anthology that he insisted we must have is public domain and easily accessed for free with a cursory google search. I think my favorite moment out of the whole semester was one morning when I stumbled into class approximately 3 minutes early wearing skeleton pajama pants from Target, having slept through my alarm after not completing the reading out of spite. I looked over the sparknotes page so that I could have a coherent thought to offer the class because participation was a significant enough chunk of my grade that I had to at least pretend I cared, and when the professor opened up the floor for discussion and nobody gave a response because it was 8:30 in the goddamn morning, I pulled something directly out of my ass. The professor gave a thoughtful nod, then turned to the rest of the class and said, 'Sarah really seems to have a solid grasp on the material, unlike the rest of you. You've got to read the assigned readings 2 or 3 times, every word, to form an argument as coherent as the one she just delivered.' Academia is $120,000 sham.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

The problem is that the public equates all higher education with majoring in a liberal arts field.  When we talk about higher education, we need to be very clear that we are not talking about every major in that particular school.  Or maybe mention 'My friend George who was in law school had the opposite problem.'","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"I think there are 3 factors to the appeal of any job: fun, use (to humankind), and money.  You can analyze the appeal of any job along these three factors. Then there's the negative factors of stress...  It's hard to pin down on a scale of 1 to 10 how fun, useful, or how much money you'd make in a certain job before you get into it, though... like you might end up really loving your subject and your environment and give being a professor a 10/10 for fun, or you might get bogged down in academic specificity and give it a 3/10 for fun. If you manage to land a job as a professor, you might be earning a comfortable 10/10 for money living, but if you end up as an adjunct you could be earning a 2/10 for money.  I got a BA in Literature as an undergrad, but never went on to grad school (mostly because I'm too shy and never talked to my professors and thus never felt comfortable asking them for recommendations), but hypothetically I would rate doing a PhD and becoming a lit professor like this:  Fun: 5/10 (I would give a 8/10 for the writing and studying, but a 3/10 for teaching bc I hate public speaking. I don't mind office politics actually because I don't get involved so I don't figure that into it.)  Use: 2/10 (I'm not going to kid myself studying literature is useful to anyone) Money: 2/10 (I doubt I'm smooth enough to get hired at a big institution so I'd probably be working as an adjunct) Stress: -8/10  Total = 1/30 I guess that's why I didn't go into academia. xD","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think there are some worthwhile fields that a philosophers can work in and make a measurable impact, both intellectually and in terms of impacting the daily lives of people.  The most notable are the various nonprofit ethical groups, especially in the field of effective altruism. Examples being GiveWell, the Future of Humanity institute and other futurist ethical organizations, Abolitionist utilitarianist communities led by incredibly influential philosophers such as David Pearce or the more mainstream Peter Singer, 80000 Hours which is an organization dedicated to helping people choose a career path that produces the most significant ethical impact on the world, animal welfare groups, etc. There are many more, but these are just a few notable examples. Philosophers in these communities are incredibly important, researching and arguing for which causes are the most important and the most efficient ways to benefit those causes. They are responsible for the distribution of huge charity funds, and their work also influences how many people choose to live their lives and helps them decide what are the most valuable things they can do to help other living beings.  Just a thought for anyone who's interested in the field of philosophy but aren't interested in the hyper-specialization of academia and would prefer to do meaningful and pragmatic work.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

I think all of us were so bored and frustrated by it, that any merits it did have were kind of lost on us.

"I love you and your work.  Also, perhaps there is hope for you (if you can stomach it) as a business consultant: URL  I work at a university and I hear stuff like this all the time: Philosophy majors are better at critical thinking and managing businesses than those with business majors, particularly management.  Or maybe you've already found your niche and can make a living debating the far right, since the majority on the left seem unable to do so.  I had an assistant who, while working for me, was finishing his masters in Philosophy and then - after he left - went on to get his PhD in Philosophy and Religious Studies.  He's far left, but sane (usually).  Does he ever protest anything? No.  Does he ever engage anyone that is moderate or right wing on anything political?  No.  He just endless debates this boring shit you just described as such with his friends.  Ugh.  I've engaged right wing crazies more often than I like (prolonged conflict makes me ill) and he has done nothing.  Actually, when he worked for me, he even tried to argue that plants had a nervous system - based on some pseudo-science crap he read and extremely well thought out logic which started with a garbage premise.  I shot him down quickly by stating that a nervous system has specific tissue type and that plants do NOT have that; I even preemptively shut him down by explaining how the venus fly trap works at the cellular level with no nervous system nor muscles.  He eventually admitted I was right.  But the problem remains - he is highly ethical, trained to thinking logically, debate, and yet can't engage anyone in the middle let alone the right.  Part of that is cowardice and part of it is lack of knowledge in: history, business (macro and micro economics), political science, and science and engineering at a basic level.   Can't fix the coward part, but he could study outside his field.  He doesn't.  And there are so many just like him.

"As a Computer Science Engineer that specializes (or at least wants to) in networking and security, I chose to quit the academic path (and possibly the professional in the future), not because of fancy private sector jobs (which where I'm from are non existent), but because:  A) I don't want to wait till I'm 30 until my life essentially starts, and I'm not a fan of the Sunk Cost fallacy. A programming/technical job is ok, but academia is not an investment to put my entire life on. B) The reason I even was there in the first place is hunger for knowledge, in a science that 'completes me', and I can't do that when I spend most of my time working for others, on random half-interesting topics. Sure, you follow a path to academic success, but it's not _my_ path. C) I prefer a simpler lifestyle. I'd rather have a simple, half-boring job that makes money, than a passion that destroys my will to live that makes money. I'm just tired of going after certifications and degrees, just to prove a point. Fuck this noise... D) The academic politics, and the resistance I have found on that path, where I'm from, just reeks of elitism and malicious opportunism. I've had to deal with certain types of fraudster assholes that I'd loathe to ever work with/for, much less exist in that culture for long periods of time. My only option is a different country, but that's not an option I can afford, nor that it's plausible for me. E) I'd rather invest in skills, rather than abstract knowledge. Abstract knowledge is good for testing ideas in your head, but again, it's just not something I want to lose my own development and life over.  Academia is a weird place. You have to be a specific type of person to want to drown in it. It takes the will to make a very long term investment, that will probably not even pay off in the end, and it's extremely hard to quit in order to do something else.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"If you want a really good book that gets at the nature of reality and consciousness, basically what you desired in both neuroscience and philosophy, I recommend When Things Fall Apart by Pema Chodron.   It sounds like the root of the problem you describe in academia, unsurprising to me, is overcomplicating everything when you haven't actually discovered anything new. Once you discover great truth or powerful wisdom about the nature of reality, you explore it deeply and over a long period of time will go through cycles of simplifying until the truth of it is miraculously simple. The thing is, language is so limited and people are bogged down by stories and illusions. So this simple truth is not accessible immediately. We always walk a path from obscurity to complexity to simplicity.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm a bit confused. So Sargon of Akkad, lacking any conservative much less far right values, seems to be mentioned here. Also an author who was mentioned as being Libertarian (classic liberal) was then mentioned as far right. There seems to be a contradiction there. Since the far right hates Libertarians and shares what seems to be no Libertarian values. This video made a lot of sense until then. Im any one thinks of Sargon of Akkad as 'Far right' I can supply a link to his channel as well as link to Libertarian values to clarify this misunderstanding. I can also explains some things myself. For example: The far left (progressive left) Believe white people as morally inferior and that black people should revive special treatment over white people. The exact reverse of what I stated is true for the far right. Libertarians believe that all people should be treated equaly and that no one is inferior. This is just an example.

The real world and real people don't line up perfectly with academic theories, and most of the time they only serve as a hindrance to debate and communication. Like oh my god arguing online became so much easier as soon as I realized no one was gonna understand specific academic words or references, and that I was better off either explaining it myself early on in the debate or just finding layman's terms to use instead.

But on one level, I freely admit that I love what I'm doing and I'm good at it. If it wasn't this, it'd be something else, but at least I enjoy this, even if it is a lot of work. It's not always clear how to proceed, and it seems like more and more everyday this type of lifestyle is occluded by emerging fields or more attractive models. Frankly I just enjoy writing about writing and want to make it work, somehow.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Hey Contra, as a person who studies philosophy as a PHD studentI have to say I enjoy it for its own sake. I'd do this even if it wasnt my job.  While it might seem super-esoteric and meaningless and not pragmatic, I'd instead say that the pursuit of knowledge and the expansion of intellectual depths always has value. Sure examining Foucault's counter argument to Dialectical Materialism or examining a Hermenuetical examination of the foundation of the subject as philosophical principle might not bring pragmatic value now or even possibly ever the very analysis of these things broadens and deepens ones own learning capacity and knowlwdge base. These things are practice for the thing we always already do constantly in our lives:learn and teach.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Well ----- with _good_ and _sound_ philosophy there _are_ results -- but not the kind of results that involve financial payback.  Furthermore ---- what results can those be? Maybe a more enlightened society ---- one that is ruled more by logic and reason than by irrational gut reactions? But that can't be achieved if the study of philosophy is geared as an elite members-only club thing. At some point, the average citizen needs to be trained in the philosophy for it to ever yield _that_ result.  Does that make academic philosophy an oxymoron? Not necessarily. There can be the basic philosophy taught to the masses --- and more advanced philosophy taught to members of a specialized vocation whose rule it is to _see_ to the education of the masses of basic philosophy --- and a possibly even _more_ specialized form of philosophy taught to those whose role it is to improve, refine, and overtime, adapt those other levels of philosophy. But the question is ---- does academic philosophy _do_ that? What _incentive_ are they given for doing that?","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"To be fair, Milton was a bit of a zealot.  Your professor was probably (badly) referencing to Fish's argument about the political violence at the heart of 'Samson Agonistes.'    While ISIS obviously isn't counting out the meter in 17th century sonnets to find ideas for terrorism, one of the most elementary points of the study of historical texts is for the reader to interpret what the rhetoric and postures of the past might reflect about our not so different present.  Even if there is no direct influence, dissecting one can help lead to understanding the mechanics of the other.  I understand if that work isn't your cup of tea--I'm taking an extended break from the academe, myself--but there's no need to add to the ample chorus of voices attacking the humanities right now.   For the record:  I don't think Milton is funding ISIS.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
"Your experience with having to face Nozick's libertarian philosophy was really quite shocking to me. It might be because I'm majoring in political science, but our first course about political philosophy really brought out all stops, making us debate - to name a few - everything from Rawls and Marx, to Nozick, Habermas and even a few radical feminist writers, most memorably MacKinnon. And this was the first month of my first semester at university. Our second semester was more or less all about structure and agency for the first two months.  Late comment is late, but it really sounds like you would have gained more pleasure from narrowing in on political philosophy. I should perhaps mention that I also live in another country, so there.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm in College right now majoring in Electrical Engineering and plan on studying Physics in Grad School. I am very interested though in Philosophy, History, Literature, and Writing. I plan on Writing throughout my life to articulate and put out into the world my own observations, critiques, analyses, and fiction dealing with the fundamental problems of existence. I don't expect to ever attain any success or notoriety with my writing but I don't care, I have to do it. I say all this to make the point that I think going to college is essentially a complete waste of money for anything outside of a STEM major and if you want to study Philosophy, History, Literature, or anything else not having to do with STEM, Medicine, or Law, then just buy books on these topics and read. Educate yourself. You don't need to go to college to study philosophy. You can just read all the great works of philosophy and learn that way without some professor telling you what it means and what is acceptable to think about it.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"Having the equivolent of a B. A. in Philosophy, I'd be lying if I said this didn't sting a bit. Don't get me wrong, your criticisms are, for the most part, legitimate. But I thought brining up Daniel Dennett was pretty telling. Some of those limitations to understanding certain schools of philosophy (particularly those stemming from continental Europe) are out-and-out ideological. There is a status quo in american philosophy more focused on (if not obsessed with) 'clarity' and science and topics that are more easy-handed. The fact of the matter is, though, a lot of what comes across as 'obscure', 'meaningless' or 'chmess' (though not all of it, admittedly) has to do with a difference in understanding underlying assumptions that *any* school of thought, including the analytic tradition, is dependent on. Works within those fields might seem uninteresting or pointless to some, and that's fair, but it's obscurity doesn't necessarily imply posturing. Thinkers like Dennett who discard entire traditions of thought because they don't conform to *their* underlying theoretical assumptions (since often they effectively *decide* that such assumptions are unproblematic) are guilty of the very thing they denounce: 1) they're intellectually dishonest and 2) their thinking implies just as much institutional busy-bodying. One-sided thinking is always a problem, since it necessarily implies sidestepping certain questions. The difference between Daniel Dennett and someone like Jordan Peterson, for example, is simply a matter of scale, as far as I'm concerned.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I love you, I need you, I will never leave you.  I'm a lawyer now after academia has spat me back up twice, once as a philosophy prof and once as a law prof. Some people never learn. I finished my PhD. I enjoyed doing it.  It wasn't ridiculously narrow or overly jargonistic, but I did lose interest in the material after I had it sink in what what I was arguing was that there weren't any good philosophical objections to empirical research programs and the people doing that work didn't care if there were. I switched over to social and political philosophy, and, yes, I do like Hegel, but I had this misfortune to like Marx more. In my experience in academia, I was always in the lunatic left  and that could get you fired. It did me, at least in part, twice. I've spent lots of time in grad school, and as a philosophy prof dealing with right wingers, including Nozick.  I think that one reason I might have liked grad school was I spent almost all my time doing on the ground in town political work against the arms race (This was the 80s) and US intervention and not with other grad students.  That didn't work so well as a professor. I was good at that stuff and I liked doing it, but I don't get on with academics. That is, other professors.  Anyway, enough about you,, let's talk about me.

Students here study to memorize for exams, and then 'data dump' everything once they've received a passing grade. I don't think children that go from living with their parents, to a college dorm room and to eventually the world, know as much about it as they profess they do. I think that all a degree in America says today about young alumni, is that they've payed (dearly) into the greedy corporation of public education, and encouraging them to study as little math and science as possible further exacerbates the problem. It isn't a secret that the working class (which has nothing to do with communism ***confusion) is mostly driven by occupations in engineering, science, technology and mathematics. So how would you fix our public education system? What advice would you give to a young and bright eyed student that is starting out in school? Please let me know at your earliest convenience. Sincerely.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I'm having a similar existential crisis about academia. I got great grades in undergrad when I was getting my biology degree and I really do love biology. The trouble came when a) I didn't get into medical school (Weird that they would ask people questions about themselves on entrance applications. I was just studying science, not myself.) and b) I found that I, if I did go to graduate school, I wanted to study the effects of cannabinoids on this specific kind of fatty tumor. Apparently it's too taboo to study anything related to Cannabis no matter what the potential health benefits might be, plus they also asked those stupid questions about me. Look at my grades! No, I wasn't schlepping around the community doing community service! My service to the community was getting good grades now so that I would know my shit to serve my community in my career. Why the fuck can't they wrap their small minds around this!? Then, I got sick both mentally and physically so I am probably monumentally fucked.

"I guess that there's some chance that at least one of the 768 preceding comments in this thread(at the time of the writing of my comment) already described the ideas that I'm about to add, but I still mention that the statement that there is no private sector opportunities for philosophers does not seem to hold. There is probably the issue that it is difficult to sell an iPhone to people, who do not use electronic notebooks('personal digital assistants') and have seen only the old Nokia phones that do not have any touchscreen or graphical applications. The iPhone was quite a bold move back in the day. So, if You PACKAGE YOUR philosophy induced STORY CREATION SERVICES a bit like teaching services are packaged to courses, then You probably do have to do some marketing, because it's a brand new type of service, but on the bright side, the success of the games like the Mass Effect (episodes 2,3,4) are popular mostly because of a RELATIVELY COMPLEX STORY, not because other computer games have  shoddier visual effects. One algorithm that is widely used at technical fields is MODULARIZATION, so that the same module(read: same investment in development) can be REUSED at very different applications and for serving very different clients/market_segments.   A TECHNICALLY successful and FINANCIALLY not-bankrupt engineering bureau, software development house, etc. tends to have a set of accumulated knowledge and a set of components/modules that are either self-developed or open source components that are TESTED or with slight modifications that sometimes fix bugs or just customize the upstream deliverables to the needs of the given team/freelancer/developer/engineer. Basically, a successful engineering bureau, be it a freelancer or a small team of freelancers or a small team at some bigger company (big teams never deliver quality, but an autonomous, small, team has a chance even in big corporations, provided that non-technical managers are held far away from the team members, have a chance) offers CONSULTANCY SERVICES that happen to use the TESTED or self-developed components. May be You can do something similar with stories. You already have a bunch of modules to use, which are the theories of different philosophers.  If You are really nasty and yearn for revenge, then You can work as some 21. century Joseph Goebbels and run some Washington ThinkTank.

Sometimes Liberal staff will force as structure of Liberal education on their students, citing but ignoring that they are, their Liberal economic goals.

"I left academia in 1996 for similar reasons. I had something of a push because I was involved in a political struggle that made things pretty unbearable for me there. I struggled on the outside for a long time. I had to go back to the same job as an Admin that I'd left in order to return to college. I was unable to pay my student loan since I hadn't dealt with my own trauma issues because I'd wasted so much time on useless theories and political debates, and I had family problems. Oh yeah, and of course I drank over it all. When I was sixty-one and a half I crashed and burned and had to go on part-time State Disability until I could take my Social Security at 62. Fortunately, I will probably be able to get my loan forgiven because of my disability, but I had to accept a very low amount to live on because I'm not disabled enough to get Federal Disability. I've been retired for almost 3 years. I'm very glad I got out of academia. I've been able to use some of the skills I learned there to do political work and street art. I realize now that I only went back to school because I didn't know what else to do with my life. There was a lot of pressure on women to do so then.

"I think it's a bit unfair to talk about dissertations as if they're boring and irrelevant. Of course they are, and of course they're highly technical and oddly specific. I'm sure you'd see the same thing in biology or sociology, where the research you're actually doing is so technical that it's unintelligible to the wider world. But it's not meant for the rest of the world, it's meant to push the field farther, and bring up new arguments or perspectives that could be used for shit that actually would be interesting.  Like, what, you expect every film student's final project to be Spielberg or something? Like if you're a carpenter it's a waste of time to make that impractical chair made of toothpicks or whatever because who would ever actually buy that?  Fuck, I feel like I gave up my passion because I let someone convince me that I couldn't be a good leftist and be in academia. I think that's bullshit though. Maybe.

If you have no material needs, then you are in control and have choices, otherwise it is a miserable drag of exploitation and humiliation with only occasional wafts of joy....even if you make it into a permanent post...in fact especially so. It's not just the demographics (more people PhDs than jobs), or the faux meritocracy (a research career is built on friends, funding and fucking time to do the stuff ) the problem is that everybody believes though know exactly what academia is about and in order to survive you need to turn that on its head while taking flak from all and sundry.

"Old video, but I just saw this and its great! As someone who felt pressured about the idea that a PhD is the only route to go, a professor sat me down and managed to present to me that it was pressure and not what I wanted as a question , do I see myself sitting at desk staring at one gene code maybe two or so if I am lucky, just trying to spend a good chunk of time looking at it? My face instantly scrunched up to the idea. I like solving things, I like helping on projects and to work on something with some kind of goal, but the idea of sitting there for years would probably make me go insane. While many people can, there are others who get their PhD and realize it was them just staying academics itself, no desire to make a career very focused with what they have. I know someone who has a PhD in some forum of Bio-Physics who is pretty much bouncing around start up companies after almost 10+ years in academic work, now figuring themselves out. They were very miserable around the time I interned in the lab feeling stuck there in some ways doing the same mRNA reading over and over and stringing in some interns (who were great and others that were downright terrible). Which is why if you want a PhD to be that immense idea of knowledge on that particular subject and the research around it. Great! However make sure the Pros outweigh the Cons and if you see yourself a few years down the road doing something with your time in grad school studying it. Which is a hard question, but one you have to ask yourself. And I think some  Grad Programs think about that too when bringing in graduate students a few years out there maybe doing some work in maybe industry and or other academic labs (looking at this from a biology perspective) are seeing that too when looking at applicants out there knowing they are coming back to school knowing this is what they want, which is nice some even look at a students major GPA vs their cumulative too.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"While I appreciate most of what you've said here, as a mathematics professor I have to say at least a few positive words about discovering higher-order truths about chmess. A couple thousand years ago one could easily have taken 'chmess' to be referring to the philosophical musings of Indian gurus about the concept 'zero'. When the Muslim Caliphate entered the picture and combined this concept with a penchant for arithmetic, algebra, and engineering, the foundations of the modern scientific method were born. It may not be a simple matter to see how these two things are connected, but great leaps forward can sometimes be made in mathematics by discovering the best notation to use for discussing a topic. A couple hundred years ago, one could easily have taken 'chmess' to be referring to the esoteric study of formal logic - people arguing about how to argue, when everyone knew that syllogisms were sufficient to handle correct argumentation. In the 1930's Alan Turing (building on the indispensable but often unappreciated work of others before him) used this arcane form of mathematics to build computers that, in addition to building the technological foundation of everything we use that has any kind of electronic component, literally shortened the second world war by a matter of years. Today, one can easily take 'chmess' to be referring, literally, to some abstract variant of chess which nobody has, is, or even could ever play, and yet solving it can have direct or indirect implications for all manner of technological progress (some of which has indisputable social implications), from the question of whether or not quantum computers will turn out to be fundamentally different to classical computers to whether or not it is even feasible to hide private communications from spying eyes in the long run.  Now I understand very well that this may not be your cup of tea, but dismissing even a subject like category theory (which has been referred to by many mathematicians as 'generalized abstract nonsense') as obviously useless seems to me to be short-sighted at best.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I think that you're stating an injustice towards the right. No, academia is not populated exclusively by regressive leftists (or leftists period) but what ends up in the news is typically either a regressive leftist making inappropriate comments about society on the whole (with little to no evidence to back them up) or a supposed member of the 'far right' being attacked by a regressive leftist. I'm glad that you don't identify with that group, but stating that course you took was 'only good for upper middle class white people discovering higher order truths about chmess' could be seen as inaccurate. I feel that you contradict yourself by saying so given that a few minutes earlier you stated that the majority of the US holds predominantly far right viewpoints. Were that the case, no one would be taking that course, particularly the aforementioned 'upper middle class white people'.That being said, just because one doesn't identify with the left doesn't mean they identify with the right (or vice versa). There IS a group of people (be they ever so small and humble) that disagree with both sides and are fairly centrist, but they don't have a voice in political or educational debate because moderation is largely not allowed between the ends of the spectrum.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I would disagree with a particular aspect. Only part of academia is to the political left.   Many fields are dominated by conservatives and mainstream thinkers: business management, economics, engineering, hard sciences, etc. And these other fields are those that get most of the money and are among the most popular fields for students because that is where the money is at.  Even in the humanities and social sciences, you will rarely meet a radical left-winger. They are mostly moderate liberals. They aren't likely as far left as the average American on issues of economics, healthcare, etc. People who have spent too much time in academia get a distorted notion of what is to the 'left' on the political spectrum, as they have no fucking clue how left is the general public who never steps foot in academia.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

It's also because although there are jewels in the muck of any particular life choice, I just find the jewels of academia a lot more interesting and worthwhile than the jewels of, say, storefront retail or daytime television.

Good, incredibly-competent people oftentimes NOT moving up because o a serious lack of any internal VETTING PROCESS by the managers at other divisions of the firm, even within the same general area, instead asking a GAZILLION STUPID, INANE SITUATIONAL QUESTIONS when, for fuck sake, you've ALREADY PROVEN YOUR WORTH A DOZEN TIMES OVER  Just ASK my fucking superiors about all my qualifications.

"For anyone who's curious, I hunted down that essay about chmess and it's making a point many people here might be sympathetic to, that a lot of questions academia discusses are some _seriously silly shit_. It warns readers to seriously ask themselves whether a given academic fad isn't actually a waste of time to discuss. Dennett quotes some impressively smartass people. Straight of the essay:  'Now none of this is child's play. In fact, one might be able to demonstrate considerable brilliance in the group activity of working out the higher-order truths of chmess. Here is where Donald Hebb's dictum comes in handy: 'If it isn't worth doing, it isn't worth doing well.''  As for me, for the record, I wanted to read the article because it sounds like a Borges short story, along the lines of 'Three Faces of Judas' or 'Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote.' I'm a little disappointed, to be honest, that the essayist decided to make a good and worthwhile point rather than writing a completely deadpan , quite possibly hilarious strategy guide for a game that doesn't exist--what I'm saying here is that I may be part of the problem, and if you want to live in a just world then by rights I should be one of the first against the wall when the worker's revolution finally comes.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

He used a scene in which there was a torrential downpour to illustrate the wrath of the heavens and the hopelessness of the characters, etc. Meanwhile O'Connell's over here remembering how fucking furious (director) Rob Reiner was that it was raining, but that they only had the location for the day and thusly had to get it over with in the rain.

"It's interesting when people complain about how politically correct college is. I don't disagree with people who say that, but it does remind me of my own college and grad school days.   I first went to Bard College, the most hipster, weed-infested campus in America, and we weren't very politically correct. I once brought up passages from Nietzsche, those some people call misogynist, and there was no shaming or outcry about it. One female student even said something like, 'Sometimes we women are cows.' or something like that. Her comment even had a bit of self-depreciating humor. In my sophomore year we read When Things Fall Apart and there were passages that nonchalantly described scenes when Okwonko beat up his wife. No one complained about the misogyny in the text.    At my senior year I read Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution. We as a class brought up one passage where Burke makes a Ronald Reagan-like argument, something like, 'The poor should learn to be poor.' The class ridiculed Burke for such an idea. But then our professor said insightful things. More poor people starved during the French Revolutionary years than any time before, and that it is more honest to tell poor people they will always be poor than to promise them bread you can't deliver.   At Fordham, my grad school, we read about poverty in 3rd world countries. We actually spent a good deal of time criticizing rich liberals who were more interested in making themselves look like heroes through charity than actually helping the people in poverty. We also watched a documentary where a British guy lived in Indian slums. We talked about how the man was patronizing the Indians and was almost like a guy from National Geographic going on a safari.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"

"I had a same problem with my Masters program in CompSci. Mostly because the core issues that I wanted to tackle (AI being one of them) was just ossified with bullshit I couldn't handle. For example, the trend in CompSci with the question of AGI (artificial general intelligence) has devolved into 'gee if we just add this vector to simulate this newly discovered but not quite well understood feature of neurons in our simulation then we can get AGI!' Which really pissed me off not because functionalism in CompSci has no use, loads of software uses it (image recognition, natural language processing, etc) but that it never gets any closer to even recreating the intelligence of a eusocial species like bees or ants. We can't even get that far with AI in terms of robotics. We cheat to make it look like we do (like the research about cooperative robots) in as much as we don't actually know how eusocial insects even work in this regard, so again we just simulate as much as we can without knowing what the hell the simulation is suppose to mean in it's original context. It just drove me to quit my program completely. Frankly, I think academia in general really needs an alcohol laden enema.

"One thing I find confusing about you Contrapoints is that you have the blisteringly cyncical awareness of the kind of folk who usually detest the self-aggrandising attitudes of humanities academics... yet a humanities academic you are [were].  At the end of the video you say that 'being able to appreciate good literature doesn't mean you can produce it'. This surprises me because it suggests that you agree with literary academia's subjective proclamation that certain literature is objectively good. You have a wonderful wit and dryness to your humour that makes me think that you could write good fiction, perhaps a black comedy. Surely, even if you write academically crappy novels which reach a wide audience and sell well, you have earned a victory?  I'm a physicist at heart and so I have deep within me a snobbish attitude about art: if its quality can't be objectively measured it's likely tripe. If your novel sold a million copies, the bank statement would be a far superior validation of your work than a professor's recommendation.

I had a professor in my undergrad who did his PhD on a grant studying wild fruit flies in the Hawaiian countryside.  If I could go back and do it all again, I think that would be a good path.

"The problem with academic philosophy isn't leftism. It's very specifically _postmodernist_ leftism.  Postmodernism has given us a few cool contributions to the arts, but its contributions to philosophy and (especially) the sciences have been about 90% malign gibberish. Even the few postmodernist philosophers who've had worthwhile ideas (Foucault, Deleuze, Butler) write in the most maddeningly obscure jargon and prose that looks like it still requires translation.   And the good postmodernists have mostly just reinvented the wheel anyway, independently coming to the same conclusions as social anarchists like Proudhon/Kropotkin/Goldman decades after they explored identical ideas, but with fewer references to literature and esoteric forms of psychoanalysis.  The social anarchist Iain McKay for instance wrote a sterling critique of right-wing libertarianism and 'anarcho'-capitalism in the late 90s in his Anarchist FAQ, all 4,000 pages of which he's made available for free online.","en","relativeinsight","2019-08-01T00:00:00"
