Number one, Ross, we need to be increasing our spending on education around the country and lifting up the per capita spend.
Number two, we want to have a big program of transport infrastructure.
And I'm looking at all sorts of things we can do to help Andy Street in the West Midlands, Northern Powerhouse Rail, there's all sorts of things we can do to help with our roads.
We need to be putting some money into the police and on Brexit.
We will of course be pushing our plan into action.
So we are getting ready to come out on October the 31st.
Come what may.
Do or die.
Come what may.
First of all we need to get rid of this current withdrawal agreement and get the best bits in it, put them through Parliament and then we want to make sure that we keep that money suspended, and waiting to hand it over if we get the deal that we want.
And then we want to make sure that we come up with the solutions for the Northern Irish border.
And I think that the way to come out is with a standstill between the UK and the EU so that we keep going with the existing arrangements until such time as we've completed our free trade agreement and we use that period to solve the questions of the Northern Irish border.
I think we can do that.
I think a bit of positive energy would help, frankly.
I've never seen such morosity and gloom from a government.
For three years we've been sitting around wrapped in defeatism telling the British public that they can't do this or that.
It is pathetic, it's absolutely pathetic.
Don't forget.
We haven't even really wanted to come out.
That's the whole, that's the, the heart of the problem.
What we've been doing is we've been creating our own incarcerate, our in prison.
The backstop, the customs union and the single market are all basically designed to keep us in.
So plan B and C and D. Plan B, we get the deal we want the type I've described, Plan B is to get a standstill, the agreement GATT 24 paragraph 5B type agreement.
If the EU won't do that and we have to come out on WTO terms then Plan C would be to get ready for that outcome.
And obviously we're going to do that and it's very, very important that we do.
And the British people have had enough of being told that they're incapable of getting ready to do this.
Actually the preparations by March the 29th were pretty far advanced and they can be very far advanced by October 31st.
What is this defeatism, this is unbelievable.
Yes, let me tell you why.
Okay.
Because it would be up to the Prime Minister of the day.
I hope myself, to decide under the current terms of the extension that we have, to apply for such an extension.
And it is up to the EU to decide whether to grant it.
At the moment, the law says that the UK is leaving the EU.
International treaty law - says the UK is leaving the EU on the 31st of October.
I think the withdrawal agreement itself as indeed Theresa May admitted in the House of Commons is defective and it's over.
I mean more than a change.
It's got to be, you know, we need a new Withdrawal Agreement.
If we're going to go out on the basis of a withdrawal agreement at all.
I think that it follows from everything that I've said, that I think politics is at a crossroads in this country.
And it is fundamental to trust in politics that we come out of the EU.
We've had two delays now.
My friends and colleagues in, in Parliament is, they've had a long time now to think about this.
Well, I don't want to cast any aspersions on my opponent.
All I would say is that I think I have three key merits: I fought for Brexit.
I believe in it.
Unlike any other candidate in this election, I can deliver it unlike any other candidate in this election.
I can also formulate a great, one nation, modern conservative agenda and show how it can unite the whole country unlike any other candidate.
And, you look at what we did in London and, uh, I believe that I'm the only candidate who can actually, uh, get ready in due course to defeat Jeremy Corbyn.
I like to paint.
I make things.
I make, I have a thing where I make models of...
When I was mayor of London...
I make, buses.
I make models of busses.
So what I do is well I don't make models of busses I get, I get old, um, wooden crates, right?
And I paint them and they have two, it's a box that's been used to contain two wine bottles right?
And it will have a dividing thing.
And I turn it into a bus and I put passengers... you really want to know this?
No, I paint the passengers enjoying themselves.
On a wonderful bus.
Low carbon of a kind that we brought to the streets of London that reduces CO2, reduces nitrous oxide, reducing pollution.
I've always greatly admired Pericles of Athens because he was the guy who said, uh, that politics was about the many, not the few.
He was the first to use exactly that... a great orator.
And, uh, he, uh, it was said that he thundered and lightened when he spoke.
But what he did is he used great infrastructure.
He invested in fantastic infrastructure.
Uh, he developed the, the, not just the Acropolis, but the Piraeus port which was integral to the success of a lot of Athens.
I'm a pretty, I, I think I'm a pretty, um, even tempered kind of guy.
I don't easily get angry.
Very good question.
Um, I think, I think like all human beings, I probably feel happiest when I've accomplished something that I've worked very hard to do and that gives me so...
I always enjoy, I always enjoy campaigns.
Uh, I love, I love campaigning.
Um, but what makes me, what makes me happiest, I think is, is, is the sense of completing a great task.
And that is what we must do and I will not be happy and I will not rest until we get out of the EU on October the 31st.
It is not the beginning of any great task but the continuing of the same until we be thoroughly finished that yieldeth the true glory.
Um, oh God, I don't know.
What was the last sports match I watched, blimey.
Well, I suppose I must've watched some, I don't ever watch TV anymore.
I play tennis quite a lot.
It's nice.
I play tennis quite a lot.
I have been at the box at Wimbledon.
I tell you what I watched a cricket match.
I watched, I went to watch England against someone, unfortunately I fell asleep.
That went badly.
