"Well, erm, this, again, these are, these are big terms...what happened was, I can tell you the whole thing."
"Are you sure our viewers don't want to hear about?"
"-    It was a long and lamentable story    What happened was I ascribed events that were supposed to have taken place before the death of Piers Gaveston to events that actually took place after the death of Piers Gaveston    I mildly sandpapered something somebody had said and yes it was very embarrassing and I'm very sorry for it."
"Again, on that I never had any conversation with Michael Howard about that matter    I don't propose to go into all that again    I've been through that question a lot, watch the documentary, why don't we talk about something else?"
"All three things I would dispute    Well I do, if we had a long time I could explain that all three interpretations you're putting on those things aren't wholly fair."
"I hadn't seen that Conrad had said that, but nonetheless I've got a great admiration for Conrad."
"He's a great journalist...I am pleased that this campaign has so far been relatively free of personal abuse – and long may it so remain – but the other day someone insulted me in terms that were redolent of 1920s Soviet Russia."
"He said that I had no right to vote Leave, because I was in fact a “liberal cosmopolitan”  That rocked me, at first, and then I decided that as insults go, I didn’t mind it at all – because it was probably true."
"And so I want this morning to explain why the campaign to Leave the EU is attracting other liberal spirits and people I admire such as David Owen, and Gisela Stuart, Nigel Lawson, John Longworth – people who love Europe and who feel at home on the continent, but whose attitudes towards the project of European Union have been hardening over time."
"For many of us who are now deeply sceptical, the evolution has been roughly the same: we began decades ago to query the anti-democratic absurdities of the EU."
"Then we began to campaign for reform, and were excited in 2013 by the Prime Minister’s Bloomberg speech; and then quietly despaired as no reform was forthcoming."
"And then thanks to the referendum given to this country by David Cameron we find that a door has magically opened in our lives."
"We can see the sunlit meadows beyond."
"I believe we would be mad not to take this once in a lifetime chance to walk through that door because the truth is it is not we who have changed."
"It is the EU that has changed out of all recognition; and to keep insisting that the EU is about economics is like saying the Italian Mafia is interested in olive oil and real estate."
"It is true, but profoundly uninformative about the real aims of that organization."
"What was once the EEC has undergone a spectacular metamorphosis in the last 30 years, and the crucial point is that it is still becoming ever more centralizing, interfering and anti-democratic."
"You only have to read the Lisbon Treaty – whose constitutional provisions were rejected by three EU populations, the French, the Dutch and the Irish – to see how far this thing has moved on from what we signed up for in 1972."
"Brussels now has exclusive or explicit competence for trade, customs, competition, agriculture, fisheries, environment, consumer protection, transport, trans-European networks, energy, the areas of freedom, security and justice, and new powers over culture, tourism, education and youth."
"The EU already has considerable powers to set rates of indirect taxation across the whole 28-nation territory, and of course it has total control of monetary policy for all 19 in the eurozone."
"In recent years Brussels has acquired its own foreign minister, its own series of EU embassies around the world, and is continuing to develop its own defence policy."
"We have got to stop trying to kid the British people; we have got to stop saying one thing in Brussels, and another thing to the domestic audience; we have got to stop the systematic campaign of subterfuge – to conceal from the public the scale of the constitutional changes involved."
"We need to look at the legal reality, which is that this is a continuing and accelerating effort to build a country called Europe."
"Look at that list of Lisbon competences – with 45 new fields of policy where Britain can be outvoted by a qualified majority – and you can see why the House of Commons Library has repeatedly confirmed that when you add primary and secondary legislation together the EU is now generating 60 per cent of the laws passing through parliament."
"The independence of this country is being seriously compromised."
"It is this fundamental democratic problem – this erosion of democracy – that brings me into this fight."
"People are surprised and alarmed to discover that our gross contributions to the EU budget are now running at about £20bn a year, and that the net contribution is £10 bn; and it is not just that we have no control over how that money is spent."
"No one has any proper control – which is why EU spending is persistently associated with fraud."
"Of course the Remain campaign dismisses this UK contribution as a mere bagatelle – even though you could otherwise use it to pay for a new British hospital every week."
"But that expense is, in a sense, the least of the costs inflicted by the EU on this country."
"It is deeply corrosive of popular trust in democracy that every year UK politicians tell the public that they can cut immigration to the tens of thousands – and then find that they miss their targets by hundreds of thousands, so that we add a population the size of Newcastle every year, with all the extra and unfunded pressure that puts on the NHS and other public services."
"In our desperation to meet our hopeless so-called targets, we push away brilliant students from Commonwealth countries, who want to pay to come to our universities; we find ourselves hard pressed to recruit people who might work in our NHS, as opposed to make use of its services – because we have absolutely no power to control the numbers who are coming with no job offers and no qualifications from the 28 EU countries."
"I am in favour of immigration; but I am also in favour of control, and of politicians taking responsibility for what is happening; and I think it bewilders people to be told that this most basic power of a state – to decide who has the right to live and work in your country – has been taken away and now resides in Brussels."
"And, as I say, that is only one aspect of a steady attrition of the rights of the people to decide their priorities, and to remove, at elections, those who take the decisions."
"It is sad that our powers of economic self-government have become so straitened that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has to go around personally asking other finance ministers to allow him to cut VAT on tampons, and as far as I can see we still have not secured consent."
"It is very worrying that the European Court of Justice – Luxembourg, not Strasbourg – should now be freely adjudicating on human rights questions, and whether or not this country has the right to deport people the Home Office believes are a threat to our security; and it is peculiar that the government is now straining at the gnat of the Convention and the Strasbourg court, whose rulings are not actually binding on UK courts, while swallowing the camel of the 55-article charter of Fundamental rights, which is fully justiciable by the European Court in Luxembourg, when you consider that it is the rulings of this court that are binding and that must be applied by every court in this country, including parliament."
"It is absurd that Britain – historically a great free-trading nation – has been unable for 42 years to do a free trade deal with Australia, New Zealand, China, India and America."
"It is above all bizarre for the Remain campaign to say that after the UK agreement of February we are now living in a “reformed” EU, when there has been not a single change to EU competences, not a single change to the Treaty, nothing on agriculture, nothing on the role of the court, nothing of any substance on borders – nothing remotely resembling the agenda for change that was promised in the 2013 Bloomberg speech."
"In that excellent speech the Prime Minister savaged the EU’s lack of competitiveness, its remoteness from the voters, its relentless movement in the wrong direction."
"As he said -  ‘The biggest danger to the European Union comes not from those who advocate change, but from those who denounce new thinking as heresy."
"In its long history Europe has experience of heretics who turned out to have a point."
"‘More of the same will not see the European Union keeping pace with the new powerhouse economies."
"More of the same will not bring the European Union any closer to its citizens."
"More of the same will just produce more of the same – less competitiveness, less growth, fewer jobs."
"‘And that will make our countries weaker not stronger."
"That is why we need fundamental, far-reaching change.’  He was right then."
"We were told that there had to be “fundamental reform” and “full-on” Treaty change that would happen “before the referendum” – or else the government was willing to campaign to Leave."
"And that is frankly what the government should now be doing."
"If you look at what we were promised, and what we got, the Government should logically be campaigning on our side today."
"We were told many times – by the PM, Home Sec and Chancellor – that we were going to get real changes to the law on free movement, so that you needed to have a job lined up before you could come here."
"We got no such change."
"We were told that we would get a working opt-out from the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights – which by the way gives the European Court the power to determine the application of the 1951 Convention on Refugees and Asylum, as well as extradition, child protection and victims’ rights."
"We got nothing."
"We were told that we would be able to stop the Eurozone countries from using the EU institutions to create a fiscal and political union."
"Instead we gave up our veto."
"The Five Presidents’ report makes it clear that as soon as the UK referendum is out of the way, they will proceed with new structures of political and fiscal integration that this country should have no part in, but which will inevitably involve us, just as we were forced – in spite of promises to the contrary – to take part in the bail-out of Greece."
"They want to go ahead with new EU rules on company law, and property rights and every aspect of employment law and even taxation – and we will be dragged in."
"To call this a reformed EU is an offence against the Trades Descriptions Act, or rather the EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive that of course replaced the Trades Descriptions Act in 2008."
"The EU system is a ratchet hauling us ever further into a federal structure."
"We have proved to ourselves time and again that we cannot change the direction."
"We cannot change the pace."
"We cannot interrupt the steady erosion of democracy, and given that we do not accept the destination it is time to tell our friends and partners, in a spirit of the utmost cordiality, that we wish to forge a new relationship based on free trade and intergovernmental cooperation."
"We need to Vote Leave on June 23, and in the meantime we must deal with the three big myths that are peddled by the Remain campaign."
"The first is the so-called economic argument."
"The Remainers accept that there is a loss of political independence, but they claim that this trade-off is economically beneficial."
"The second argument we might broadly call the peace-in-Europe argument – that the EU is associated with 70 years of stability, and we need to stay in to prevent German tanks crossing the French border."
"The third argument is more abstract, but potent with some people."
"It is that you can’t really want to leave the EU without being in some way anti-European, and that the Remain camp therefore have a monopoly on liberal cosmopolitanism."
"All three arguments are wholly bogus."
"The most important mistake is to think that there is some effective and sensible trade-off between the loss of democratic control and greater economic prosperity."
"The whole thrust of the Remain argument is that there is a democratic cost, but an economic benefit – that if we accept that 60 per cent of our laws are made in Brussels, we will see some great boost in our trade and our exports and in the overall economic performance of the EU."
"This is turning out to be simply false."
"The loss of democratic control is spiritually damaging, and socially risky – and the economic benefits of remaining subject to the Single Market law-making machine, as opposed to having access to the Single Market, are in fact very hard to detect."
"What the government wants is for us to remain locked into the Single Market law-making regime, and to be exposed to 2500 new EU regulations a year."
"What we want is for Britain to be like many other countries in having free-trade access to the territory covered by the Single Market – but not to be subject to the vast, growing and politically-driven empire of EU law."
"There is a good deal of evidence that this is the more sensible position to be in."
"Take the two relevant 20 year periods, before and after the creation of the Single Market, in other words from 1973 to 1992, and from 1992 to 2012."
"Now when the single market dawned, we were told that it was going to be a great dynamo of job and wealth creation – 800 billion euros, the Cecchini report said, of extra European GDP."
"We were told that it was going to send exports whizzing ever faster across borders."
"So what happened?"
"Did Britain export more to the rest of the EEC 11, as a result of the Single Market?"
"On the contrary, the rate of growth slowed, as Michael Burrage has shown this year."
"British exports of goods were actually 22 per cent lower, at the end of the second 20 year period, than if they had continued to grow at the rate of the 20 years pre-1992."
"And before you say that this might be just a result of Britain’s sluggish performance in the export of manufactured goods, the same failure was seen in the case of the 12 EEC countries themselves."
"We were told that goods would start pinging around the EEC as if in some supercharged cyclotron; and on the contrary, the rate of growth flattened again – 14.6 per cent lower than the previous 20 years when there was no single market."
"So what was the decisive advantage to Britain, or any other country, of being inside this system, and accepting these thousands of one-size-fits-all regulations?"
"In fact you could argue that many countries were better off being outside, and not subject to the bureaucracy."
"In the period of existence of this vaunted single market, from 1992 to 2011, there were 27 non-EU countries whose exports of goods to the rest of the EU grew faster than the UK’s; and most embarrassingly of all – there were 21 countries who did better than the UK in exporting services to the other EEC 11."
"So where was this great European relaunch that was supposed to be driven by the 1992 Single Market?"
"In the 20 years since the start of the Single Market, the rate of growth in the EU countries has actually been outstripped by the non-EU countries of the OECD."
"It is the independent countries that have done better; and the EU has been a microclimate of scandalously high unemployment."
"This year the US is projected to grow by 2.4 per cent, China by 6.5 pc, NZ by 2 pc, Australia by 2.5 pc and India by 7.5 pc."
"The Eurozone – 1.5 per cent."
"All that extra growth we were promised; all those extra jobs."
"The claims made for the Single Market are looking increasingly fraudulent."
"It has not boosted the rate of British exports to the EU; it has not even boosted growth in exports between the EU 12; and it has not stopped a generation of young people – in a huge belt of Mediterranean countries – from being thrown on to the scrapheap."
"What has that corpus of EU regulation done to drive innovation?"
"There are more patents from outside the EU now being registered at the EU patent office than from within the EU itself."
"The Eurozone has no universities within the top 20, and has been woefully left behind by America in the tech revolution – in spite of all those directives I remember from the 1990s about les reseaux telematiques; or possibly, of course, the EU has been left behind on tech precisely because of those directives."
"There are plenty of other parts of the world where the free market and competition has been driving down the cost of mobile roaming charges and cut-price airline tickets – without the need for a vast supranational bureaucracy enforced by a supranational court."
"I hear again the arguments from the City of London, and the anxieties that have been expressed."
"We heard them 15 years ago, when many of the very same Remainers prophesied disaster for the City of London if we failed to join the euro."
"They said all the banks would flee to Frankfurt."
"Well, Canary Wharf alone is now far bigger than the Frankfurt financial centre – and has kept growing relentlessly since the crash of 2008."
"As for the argument that we need the muscle of EU membership, if we are to do trade deals –-well, look, as I say, at the results after 42 years of membership."
"The EU has done trade deals with the Palestinian authority and San Marino."
"Bravo."
"But it has failed to conclude agreements with India, China or even America."
"Why?"
"Because negotiating on behalf of the EU is like trying to ride a vast pantomime horse, with 28 people blindly pulling in different directions."
"For decades deals with America have been blocked by the French film industry, and the current TTIP negotiations are stalled at least partly because Greek feta cheese manufacturers object to the concept of American feta."
"They may be right, aesthetically, but it should not be delaying us in this country."
"Global trade is not carried on by kind permission of people like Peter Mandelson."
"People and businesses trade with each other, and always will, as long as they have something to buy and sell."
"But it is notable that even when the EU has done a trade deal, it does not always seem to work in Britain’s favour."
"In ten out of the last 15 deals, British trade with our partners has actually slowed down, rather than speeded up, after the deal was done."
"Is that because of some defect in us, or in the deal?"
"Could it be that the EU officials did not take account of the real interests of the UK economy, which is so different in structure from France and Germany?"
"And might that be because the sole and entire responsibility for UK trade policy is in the hands of the EU commission – a body where only 3.6 per cent of the officials actually come from this country?"
"In trying to compute the costs and benefits of belonging to the Single Market, we should surely add the vast opportunity cost of not being able to do free trade deals with the most lucrative and fastest-growing markets in the world – because we are in the EU."
"When you consider that only 6 per cent of UK business export to the EU 28; and when you consider that 100 per cent of our businesses – large and small – must comply with every jot and tittle of regulation; and when you consider that the costs of this regulation are estimated at £600m per week, I am afraid you are driven to the same conclusion as Wolfgang Munchau, the economics commentator of the FT, who said, “whatever the reasons may be for remaining in the EU, they are not economic.”  And so I return to my point; that we must stop the pretence."
"This is about politics, and a political project that is now getting out of control."
"To understand our predicament, and the trap we are in, we need to go back to the immediate post-war period, and the agony and shame of a broken continent."
"There were two brilliant Frenchmen – a wheeler-dealing civil servant with big American connexions called Jean Monnet, and a French foreign minister called Robert Schuman."
"They wanted to use instruments of economic integration to make war between France and Germany not just a practical but a psychological impossibility."
"It was an exercise in what I believe used to be called behavioural therapy; inducing a change in the underlying attitudes by forcing a change in behaviour."
"Their inspired idea was to weave a cat’s cradle of supranational legislation that would not only bind the former combatants together, but create a new sensation of European-ness."
"As Schuman put it, “Europe will be built through concrete achievements which create a de facto solidarity.” Jean Monnet believed that people would become “in mind European”, and that this primarily functional and regulatory approach would produce a European identity and a European consciousness."
"Almost 60 years after the Treaty of Rome, I do not see many signs that this programme is working."
"The European elites have indeed created an ever-denser federal system of government, but at a pace that far exceeds the emotional and psychological readiness of the peoples of Europe."
"The reasons are obvious."
"There is simply no common political culture in Europe; no common media, no common sense of humour or satire; and – this is important – no awareness of each other’s politics, so that the European Union as a whole has no common sense of the two things you need for a democracy to work efficiently."
"You need trust, and you need shame."
"There is no trust, partly for the obvious reason that people often fail to understand each other’s languages."
"There is no shame, because it is not clear who you are letting down if you abuse the EU system."
"That is why there is such cavalier waste and theft of EU funds: because it is everybody’s money, it is nobody’s money."
"If you walk around London today, you will notice that the 12 star flag of the EU is flying all over the place."
"That is because this is Schuman day."
"It is the birthday of the founder of this project, and the elites have decreed that it should be properly marked."
"Do we feel loyalty to that flag?"
"Do our hearts pitter-patter as we watch it flutter over public buildings?"
"On the contrary."
"The British share with other EU populations a growing sense of alienation, which is one of the reasons turn-out at European elections continues to decline."
"As Jean-Claude Juncker has himself remarked with disapproval, “too many Europeans are returning to a national or regional mindset”."
"In the face of that disillusionment, the European elites are doing exactly the wrong thing."
"Instead of devolving power, they are centralizing."
"Instead of going with the grain of human nature and public opinion, they are reaching for the same corrective behavioural therapy as Monnet and Schuman: more legislation, more federal control; and whenever there is a crisis of any kind the cry is always the same."
"“More Europe, more Europe!”  What did they do when the Berlin wall came down, and the French panicked about the inevitability of German unification?"
"“More Europe!” And what are they saying now, when the ensuing single currency has become a disaster?"
"“More Europe!”  They persist in the delusion that political cohesion can be created by a forcible economic integration, and they are achieving exactly the opposite."
"What is the distinctive experience of the people of Greece, over the last eight years?"
"It is a complete humiliation, a sense of powerlessness."
"The suicide rate has risen by 35 per cent; life expectancy has actually fallen."
"Youth unemployment is around 50 per cent."
"It is an utter disgrace to our continent."
"That is what happens when you destroy democracy."
"Do the Greeks feel warmer towards the Germans?"
"Do they feel a community of interest?"
"Of course not."
"In Austria the far-right have just won an election for the first time since the 1930s."
"The French National Front are on the march in France, and Marine le Pen may do well in the Presidential elections."
"You could not say that EU integration is promoting either mutual understanding or moderation, and the economic consequence range from nugatory to disastrous."
"The answer to the problems of Europe today is not “more Europe”, if that means more forcible economic and political integration."
"The answer is reform, and devolution of powers back to nations and people, and a return to intergovernmentalism, at least for this country – and that means Vote Leave on June 23."
"And of course there will be some in this country who are rightly troubled by a sense of neighbourly duty."
"There are Remainers who may agree with much of the above; that the economic advantages for Britain are either overstated or non-existent."
"But they feel uneasy about pulling out of the EU in its hour of need, when our neighbours are in distress; and at this point they deploy the so-called “Peace in Europe” argument: that if Britain leaves the EU, there will be a return to slaughter on Flanders Fields."
"I think this grossly underestimates the way Europe has changed, and the Nato guarantee that has really underpinned peace in Europe."
"I saw the disaster when the EU was charged with sorting out former Yugoslavia, and I saw how Nato sorted it out."
"And it understates the sense in which it is the EU itself, and its anti-democratic tendencies that are now a force for instability and alienation."
"Europe faces twin crises of mass migration, and a euro that has proved a disaster for some member states; and the grim truth is that the risks of staying in this unreformed EU are intensifying and not diminishing."
"In the next six weeks we must politely but relentlessly put the following questions to the Prime Minister and to the Remain campaign…  1) How can you possibly control EU immigration into this country?"
"2)  The Living Wage is an excellent policy, but how will you stop it being a big pull factor for uncontrolled EU migration, given that it is far higher than minimum wages in other EU countries?"
"3) How will you prevent the European Court from interfering further in immigration, asylum, human rights, and all kinds of matters which have nothing to do with the so-called Single Market?"
"4) Why did you give up the UK veto on further moves towards a fiscal and political union?"
"5) How can you stop us from being dragged in, and from being made to pay?"
"The answer is that the Remain campaign have no answers to any of these questions, because they are asking us to remain in an EU that is wholly unreformed, and going in the wrong direction."
"If we leave on June 23, we can still provide leadership in so many areas."
"We can help lead the discussions on security, on counter-terrorism, on foreign and defence policy, as we always have."
"But all those conversation can be conducted within an intergovernmental framework, and without the need for legal instruments enforced by the European Court of Justice."
"We will still be able to cooperate on the environment, on migration, on science and technology; we will still have exchanges of students."
"We will trade as much as ever before, if not more."
"We will be able to love our fellow Europeans, marry them, live with them, share the joy of discovering our different cultures and languages – but we will not be subject to the jurisdiction of a single court and legal system that is proving increasingly erratic and that is imitated by no other trading group."
"We will not lose influence in Europe or around the world – on the contrary, you could argue we will gain in clout."
"We are already drowned out around the table in Brussels; we are outvoted far more than any other country – 72 times in the last 20 years, and ever more regularly since 2010; and the Eurozone now has a built-in majority on all questions."
"We will recapture or secure our voice – for the 5th biggest economy in the world – in international bodies such as the WTO or the IMF or the CITES, where the EU is increasingly replacing us and laying a claim to speak on our behalf."
"If you want final and conclusive proof of our inability to “get our way” in Brussels – and the contempt with which we will be treated if we vote to Remain – look again at the UK deal and the total failure to secure any change of any significance."
"Above all – to get to the third key point of the Remainers – if we leave the EU we will not, repeat not, be leaving Europe."
"Of all the arguments they make, this is the one that infuriates me the most."
"I am a child of Europe."
"I am a liberal cosmopolitan and my family is a genetic UN peacekeeping force."
"I can read novels in French and I can sing the Ode to joy in German, and if they keep accusing me of being a Little Englander, I will."
"Both as editor of the Spectator and Mayor of London I have promoted the teaching of modern European languages in our schools."
"I have dedicated much of my life to the study of the origins of our common – our common European culture and civilization in ancient Greece and Rome."
"So I find if offensive, insulting, irrelevant and positively cretinous to be told – sometimes by people who can barely speak a foreign language – that I belong to a group of small-minded xenophobes; because the truth is it is Brexit that is now the great project of European liberalism, and I am afraid that it is the European Union – for all the high ideals with which it began, that now represents the ancien regime."
"It is we who are speaking up for the people, and it is they who are defending an obscurantist and universalist system of government that is now well past its sell by date and which is ever more remote from ordinary voters."
"It is we in the Leave Camp – not they – who stand in the tradition of the liberal cosmopolitan European enlightenment – not just of Locke and Wilkes, but of Rousseau and Voltaire; and though they are many, and though they are well-funded, and though we know that they can call on unlimited taxpayer funds for their leaflets, it is we few, we happy few who have the inestimable advantage of believing strongly in our cause, and that we will be vindicated by history; and we will win for exactly the same reason that the Greeks beat the Persians at Marathon – because they are fighting for an outdated absolutist ideology, and we are fighting for freedom."
"That is the choice on June 23."
"It is between taking back control of our money – or giving a further £100bn to Brussels before the next election."
"Between deciding who we want to come here to live and work – or letting the EU decide."
"Between a dynamic liberal cosmopolitan open global free-trading prosperous Britain, or a Britain where we remain subject to a undemocratic system devised in the 1950s that is now actively responsible for low growth and in some cases economic despair."
"Between believing in the possibility of hope and change in Europe – or accepting that we have no choice but to knuckle under."
"It is a choice between getting dragged ever further into a federal superstate, or taking a stand now."
"Vote Leave on June 23, and take back control of our democracy.This EU referendum has been the most extraordinary political event of our lifetime."
"Never in our history have so many people been asked to decide a big question about the nation’s future."
"Never have so many thought so deeply, or wrestled so hard with their consciences, in an effort to come up with the right answer."
"It has been a gruelling campaign in which we have seen divisions between family and friends and colleagues – sometimes entirely amicable, sometimes, alas, less so."
"In the end, there was a clear result."
"More than 17 million people voted to leave the EU – more than have ever assented to any proposition in our democratic history."
"Some now cast doubt on their motives, or even on their understanding of what was at stake."
"It is said that those who voted Leave were mainly driven by anxieties about immigration."
"I do not believe that is so."
"After meeting thousands of people in the course of the campaign, I can tell you that the number one issue was control – a sense that British democracy was being undermined by the EU system, and that we should restore to the people that vital power: to kick out their rulers at elections, and to choose new ones."
"I believe that millions of people who voted Leave were also inspired by the belief that Britain is a great country, and that outside the job-destroying coils of EU bureaucracy we can survive and thrive as never before."
"I think that they are right in their analysis, and right in their choice."
"And yet we who agreed with this majority verdict must accept that it was not entirely overwhelming."
"There were more than 16 million who wanted to remain."
"They are our neighbours, brothers and sisters who did what they passionately believe was right."
"In a democracy majorities may decide but everyone is of equal value."
"We who are part of this narrow majority must do everything we can to reassure the Remainers."
"We must reach out, we must heal, we must build bridges – because it is clear that some have feelings of dismay, and of loss, and confusion."
"I believe that this climate of apprehension is understandable, given what people were told during the campaign, but based on a profound misunderstanding about what has really taken place."
"At home and abroad, the negative consequences are being wildly overdone, and the upside is being ignored."
"The stock market is way above its level of last autumn; the pound remains higher than it was in 2013 and 2014."
"The economy is in good hands."
"Most sensible people can see that Bank of England governor Mark Carney has done a superb job – and now that the referendum is over, he will be able to continue his work without being in the political firing-line."
"Thanks in large part to the reforms put in place by David Cameron and George Osborne, the fundamentals of the UK economy are outstandingly strong – a dynamic and outward-looking economy with an ever-improving skills base, and with a big lead in some of the key growth sectors of the 21st century."
"We should be incredibly proud and positive about the UK, and what it can now achieve."
"And we will achieve those things together, with all four nations united."
"We had one Scotland referendum in 2014, and I do not detect any real appetite to have another one soon; and it goes without saying that we are much better together in forging a new and better relationship with the EU – based on free trade and partnership, rather than a federal system."
"I cannot stress too much that Britain is part of Europe, and always will be."
"There will still be intense and intensifying European cooperation and partnership in a huge number of fields: the arts, the sciences, the universities, and on improving the environment."
"EU citizens living in this country will have their rights fully protected, and the same goes for British citizens living in the EU."
"British people will still be able to go and work in the EU; to live; to travel; to study; to buy homes and to settle down."
"As the German equivalent of the CBI – the BDI – has very sensibly reminded us, there will continue to be free trade, and access to the single market."
"Britain is and always will be a great European power, offering top-table opinions and giving leadership on everything from foreign policy to defence to counter-terrorism and intelligence-sharing – all the things we need to do together to make our world safer."
"The only change – and it will not come in any great rush – is that the UK will extricate itself from the EU’s extraordinary and opaque system of legislation: the vast and growing corpus of law enacted by a European Court of Justice from which there can be no appeal."
"This will bring not threats, but golden opportunities for this country – to pass laws and set taxes according to the needs of the UK."
"Yes, the Government will be able to take back democratic control of immigration policy, with a balanced and humane points-based system to suit the needs of business and industry."
"Yes, there will be a substantial sum of money which we will no longer send to Brussels, but which could be used on priorities such as the NHS."
"Yes, we will be able to do free trade deals with the growth economies of the world in a way that is currently forbidden."
"There is every cause for optimism; a Britain rebooted, reset, renewed and able to engage with the whole world."
"This was a seismic campaign whose lessons must be learnt by politicians at home and abroad."
"We heard the voices of millions of the forgotten people, who have seen no real increase in their incomes, while FTSE-100 chiefs now earn 150 times the average pay of their employees."
"We must pursue actively the one-nation policies that are among David Cameron’s fine legacy, such as his campaigns on the Living Wage and Life Chances."
"There is no doubt that many were speaking up for themselves."
"But they were also speaking up for democracy, and the verdict of history will be that the British people got it right.It’s a measure of the resilience of this country that since the vote to leave the EU and in defiance of all predictions, the economy has grown much faster than the rest of Europe."
"Unemployment has fallen to the lowest level since 1972, exports have soared, English football teams have won both the Champions League and the UEFA cup by beating other English football teams, and inward investment has soared to a record £1.3 trillion."
"It’s almost as if the commercial dynamism of the British people is insulating them from the crisis in our politics, and yet we cannot ignore the morass of Westminster, where parties have entered a yellow box junction, unable to move forward or back, while around the country, there is a mood of disillusion even despair at our ability to get things done."
"The longer it goes on, the worse the risk that there will be serious contamination and a real loss of confidence because the people of this country deserve better from their leaders."
"They need courage and they need clarity and they want a resolution."
"And that is our mission today, and that is why I’m standing before you because now is the time to remember our duty to the people and the reasons for the Brexit vote."
"It wasn’t just about democracy."
"Though, that was fundamental."
"It wasn’t just about immigration though people were entirely reasonable in wanting national control."
"I remember that campaign vividly, and I think I understood some of the feelings of those who voted to leave."
"They wanted to be heard."
"They wanted to feel that they too could be part of the astonishing success of this country."
"They wanted to feel that their hopes and dreams were as important to the government as the desires and priorities of any Metropolitan-style guru or tech king or the head of some FTSE 100 company."
"And so now is the time to unite this country and unite this society."
"And we cannot begin that task until we have delivered on the primary request of the people – the big thing that they asked us to do."
"After three years and two missed deadlines, we must leave the EU on October 31st."
"We must do better than the current Withdrawal Agreement, that has been rejected three times by Parliament, and let me clear that I am not aiming for a no-deal outcome."
"I don’t think that we will end up with any such thing."
"But it is only responsible to prepare vigorously and seriously for no deal."
"Indeed, it is astonishing that anyone could suggest dispensing with that vital tool of negotiation."
"I think this is a great country, and that we are more than capable of rising to the challenge and it’s only by preparing and raising awareness of what no deal might entail that we would ensure that we do not resort to that option."
"It’s only if we have the guts and the courage to get ready for it that we will carry any conviction in Brussels and get the deal we need because they don’t want no deal any more than I do."
"And we will simply not get a result if we give the impression that we want to go on kicking the can down the road with yet more delay."
"Delay means defeat."
"Delay means Corbyn."
"Kick the can again and we kick the bucket with every week and month that goes by, in which we fail to deliver on our promise."
"I’m afraid we will further alienate, not just our natural supporters driving them into the arms of insurgent parties, anyone who believes that politicians should deliver on their promises."
"The paradox is that we have not allayed the divisions in our society by failing to deliver the outcome, which millions voted for, we wouldn’t ease the tensions with delay, we made them worse, and we risk making them worse again."
"And so when we come up with that better deal."
"I think there will be a sense of overwhelming relief."
"As Brexit finally leaves the front pages, and becomes a debate about how to get the best possible free-trade deal in Brussels, and then they’ll be the chance to concentrate on the Britain that we can create for everyone."
"It’s an extraordinary fact that the United Kingdom is forecast in our lifetimes, to go neck and neck with Germany as the largest most prosperous economy in Europe."
"With the lead in so many of the cutting edge industries: tech, academia, battery technology, turbine design that is enabling us to be world leaders in clean power and environmental protection."
"And yet, if I may be permitted to use a metaphor based on the internal combustion engine."
"We are somehow achieving Grand Prix speeds, but without firing on all cylinders."
"We all know there is a huge gulf in the prosperity between London in the southeast, the most productive region in the whole of Europe, and the rest of the UK."
"And so if we are to respond to that profound message of the Brexit vote."
"If we are to unite our country and unite our society, then we must fight now, for those who feel left behind."
"We need now to level up, not to neglect our capital of course not, but to put in the infrastructure that will lift every region, Northern Powerhouse rail, proper connectivity in the West Midlands."
"It is absurd that Spain should have 80 per cent coverage of fibre optic broadband against only seven per cent in this country."
"Madness, that Leeds should be the largest city in Europe with no metro rail system."
"We must end the injustice of our education funding gap both in primary and secondary schools, giving young people everywhere the same tools and the same freedom and the same confidence to succeed and do more to fund our amazing at the colleges that have been too often forgotten, because it should be our fundamental moral purpose as a government to bridge, not just the wealth gap, not just the productivity gap, but the opportunity gap between one part of the UK and another."
"And I know we can do it."
"I know we can unite our country and our society."
"Because I have seen and used exactly those tools to help to unite our capital, the greatest city on Earth."
"When I became mayor 11 years ago, we had four of the six poorest boroughs in the UK."
"When I left office after the two terms, we had none of the bottom 20, and although everybody’s life expectancy had risen it was among the poorest quartile, that the games had been fastest and what was the method by which we brought the city together: we made fantastic investments in affordable mass transit, so that people on modest incomes could live near their place of work, we out-built Labour with more than 100,000 affordable homes, we massively expanded the London Living Wage policy that was then adopted by the national government."
"We cut the murder rate by 50 per cent, cut road traffic fatalities by 50 per cent."
"And when you consider that those calamities fall disproportionately on poorer families, you can see that everything we did was driven by a desire for social justice and promoted that outcome, and yet of course at the same time, we defended and championed the businesses and wealth creators who make those investments possible and there was a long period when I was just about the only politician who is willing to stick up for financial services, even though they produce about £70 billion in tax for our economy and I did it because that is the symmetry at the heart of modern conservatism."
"We can fight for the teachers and the nurses, and the firemen, and the armed service personnel and the police, precisely because we are willing to encourage the tech wizards and the shopkeepers and the taxi drivers and, yes, the bankers as well."
"And we enable the extraordinary success of our private sector with a strong committed, passionate, well funded public sector."
"It’s that synergy, that symbiosis, that sizzling synergy that is so fertile in generating further economic growth and that is the formula that is the way we will breach the opportunity gap and bring the country together, responding to a mighty plea of the majority of our people for fundamental change on the 23rd June 2016 so that no town, no community, no person feels left behind."
"That is the way we will reknit the bonds of this amazing country and in everything we do, we will seek to strengthen the union of our four nations."
"That invincible quartet, the awesome foursome that makes up the UK, the world soft power superpower, and I’ve seen across the world in our armed forces in our diplomacy, our sheer cultural impact how we are so much more than the sum of our parts."
"Our friends abroad don’t think of England or Scotland, or Wales, or Northern Ireland, they think of all the values that are expressed by that Union Flag."
"Economic and political freedom, democracy, free speech, human rights, a passionate determination to campaign for the protection of the natural world."
"Female education."
"That’s what they know the United Kingdom stands for, and they admire it deeply."
"And over the last few years, I’ve seen in our friends the desire for this country to recover its confidence and self-belief."
"And the curious thing is that very often it’s been our friends and partners who have shown more confidence in this country than we have ourselves."
"It’s time to end this debilitating uncertainty, to end the doubts and division with clarity and decision."
"And that is why I believe I’m the right person to take this country forward and I’m proud and humbled to have the support of so many of my parliamentary friends and colleagues here today, and indeed my representatives of my former team in City Hall."
"And though I do not for one minute underestimate the complexity and challenges that lie ahead."
"I have long experience of managing real short term difficulties in the confident expectation of long-term success."
"I took this city through riots and strikes and all the teething problems of the Olympics, which was actually no picnic as I remember, and with a team of stars we brought this city together with new infrastructure, with renewed and relentless emphasis on education and technology, we shrank that opportunity gap, and to sum up my mission in a sentence: what I want to do now, with your help, is to do for the whole country what we did in London, releasing the creative energies of our country and its peoples and healing its divisions and I will make one final observation."
"I know the London Labour Left."
"I have studied them and their ways."
"I know who they are, I know their obsessions with strange far-left Latin American caudillos with proto-Marxist views and a curious hostility to free speech."
"And yet in Jeremy Corbyn we have a man who is far to the Left of Ken Livingstone, in his nihilistic determination to hike taxes to penal rates, to attack wealth creation and private property, and its failure, again and again, to extirpate anti-Semitism from his circle."
"And I’m afraid that he, and what he stands for, are a real threat to our fundamental values and our way of life."
"I come to this fight now as a proud conservative to this campaign and just about every seat in the country."
"And I believe in the innate decency of our country in his genius and in its hard-won freedoms."
"I believe in setting people free by equipping them with the education to achieve their dreams."
"I believe in the vital symmetry between free-market economics and superb public services, and I will do absolutely anything I can within the bounds of the constitution and the law to prevent the government of the UK from passing into the hands of those who, by their total disdain for wealth creation, their content – the normal aspirations of millions to improve their lives – would compromise our ability to fund the NHS, and so much else besides."
"My friends, we cannot let them anywhere near Downing Street."
"Last time, I would remind you, that I faced an emanation of that cabal, I defeated him when the Conservatives were 17 points behind in London."
"We can do it again and we must."
"We can get Brexit done and we can win."
"We can unite our country and our society and that is why I’m standing to be leader of the Conservative party and prime minister because this contest is not chiefly about any one person, or even about the Conservative party, it is the opening salvo in a battle to restore faith in our democracy to renew the natural ties of affection that unite the UK, and to protect this country from red-tooth, red-clawed socialism of today’s Labour party."
"And we’re going to do this by articulating a new and inspiring vision for sensible moderate, modern conservatism."
"My friends, I ask you, now, to join me in that great project and yes, sometimes that great challenge that lies before us, but with your help and with the help of the British people we will succeed and the whole country will win.Mr Speaker, I want to thank you for granting me this opportunity first to pay tribute to the men and women of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, who have done an outstanding job over the last two years."
"I am very proud that we have rallied the world against Russia’s barbaric use of chemical weapons, with an unprecedented 28 countries joining together to expel 153 spies in protest at what happened in Salisbury."
"We have rejuvenated the Commonwealth with a superb summit that saw Zimbabwe back on the path to membership – and Angola now wanting to join."
"As I leave, we are leading global campaigns against illegal wildlife trade and in favour of 12 years of quality education for every girl."
"We have the flag going up in nine new missions in the Pacific and the Caribbean and Africa and more to come."
"And we have overtaken France to boast the biggest diplomatic network of any European country."
"None of this would have been possible without the support of my Rt Hon Friend the Prime Minister."
"Everyone who has worked with her will recognise her courage and resilience."
"It was my privilege to collaborate with her in promoting Global Britain, a vision for this country she set out with great clarity at Lancaster House on January 17th last year a country eager, as she said, not just to do a bold, ambitious and comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU, out of the customs union and out of the single market, but also to do new free trade deals around the world."
"I thought it was the right vision then."
"I think so today."
"But in the 18 months that have followed, it is as though a fog of self-doubt has descended."
"Even though our EU friends and partners liked the Lancaster House vision – it was what they were expecting from an ambitious partner, and what they understood – even though the commentators liked it, and the markets liked it (the pound soared), we never actually went to Brussels and turned it into a negotiating offer."
"Instead we dithered."
"We burned through negotiating capital."
"We agreed to hand over a £40billion exit fee, with no discussion of our future economic relationship."
"We accepted the jurisdiction of the European Court over key aspects of the withdrawal agreement."
"And, worst of all, we allowed the question of the Northern Irish border,  which had hitherto been assumed on all sides to be readily soluble, to become so politically charged as to dominate the debate."
"No one wants a hard border."
"You couldn’t construct one if you tried."
"But there certainly can be different rules north and south of the border to reflect the fact that there are two different jurisdictions."
"In fact there already are."
"There can be checks away from the border, and technical solutions, as the PM described at Mansion House."
"In fact there already are."
"But when I and other colleagues proposed further technical solutions to make customs and regulatory checks remotely, they were never even properly examined,  as if such solutions had become intellectually undesirable in the context of the argument."
"And somehow, after the December joint report, whose backstop arrangement we were all told was entirely provisional, never to be invoked, it became taboo even to discuss technical fixes."
"So, Mr Speaker, after 18 months of stealthy retreat, we have come from the bright certainties of Lancaster House to the Chequers agreement."
"Put them side by side."
"Lancaster House said laws will be once again “made in Westminster”."
"Chequers says there will be “ongoing harmonisation” with a common EU rulebook."
"Lancaster House said it would be wrong to “comply with EU rules and regulations without having a vote on what those rules and regulations are”."
"Chequers now makes us rule takers."
"Lancaster House said we don’t want anything that leaves us “half-in, half-out” and that “we do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave”."
"Chequers says that we will remain in lockstep on goods and agrifoods and much more besides,with disputes ultimately adjudicated by the European Court of Justice."
"Far from making laws in Westminster, there are large sectors in which ministers will have no power to initiate, innovate or even deviate."
"After decades in which UK ministers have gone to Brussels and expostulated against costly EU regulation, we are now claiming that we must accept every jot and tittle of it for our own economic health – and with no say of our own, and no way of protecting our businesses and entrepreneurs from rules that may be not in their interests."
"My Rt Hon Friend the Chancellor was asked to identify the biggest single opportunity from Brexit."
"After some thought, he said “regulatory innovation”."
"Well, there may be regulatory innovation post-Brexit, but it won’t be coming from the UK, or not in these areas anyway."
"We are volunteering for economic vassalage, not just in goods and agrifoods, but we will be forced to match EU arrangements on the environment and social affairs and much else besides."
"Of course we all want high standards, but it is hard to see how the Conservative Government of the 1980s could have done its vital supply side reforms with these freedoms taken away."
"Indeed, the result of accepting the EU’s rule books, and of our proposal of a fantastical Heath Robinson customs arrangement,  is that we have much less scope to do free trade deals – as the Chequers paper actually acknowledges, and which we should all acknowledge."
"Otherwise we continue to make the fatal mistake of underestimating the intelligence of the public, saying one thing to the EU about what we are really doing, and pretending another to the electorate."
"Given that in important ways this is BINO or Brino or Brexit in name only, I am of course unable to support it, as I said in Cabinet at Chequers, and am happy to be able now to speak out against it."
"Mr Speaker, it is not too late to save Brexit."
"We have time in these negotiations."
"We have changed tack once and we can change again."
"The problem is not that we failed to make the case for a Free Trade Agreement of the kind spelt out at Lancaster House."
"We haven’t even tried."
"We must try now, because we will not have another chance to get this right."
"It is absolute nonsense to imagine – as I fear some of my colleagues do – that we can somehow afford to make a botched Treaty now, and then break and reset the bone later on."
"We have seen even in these talks how the supposedly provisional becomes eternal."
"We have the time, and I  believe the Prime Minister  has the support of Parliament – remember the enthusiasm for Lancaster House – and it was clear last night that there is no majority for going back to the customs union."
"With goodwill and common sense we can address concerns about the Northern Ireland border and all other borders."
"We have fully two and a half years to make the technical preparations – along with the preparations for a WTO outcome, which we should now accelerate."
"We do not need to be stampeded by anyone."
"Let’s explicitly aim once again for the glorious vision of Lancaster House, a strong independent self-governing Britain that is genuinely open to the world, not the miserable permanent limbo of Chequers, the democratic disaster of “ongoing harmonisation” with no way out and no say for the UK."
"We need to take one decision now before all others – and that is to believe in this country and what it can do."
"The UK’s admirers across the world are fully expecting us to take back control, to be able to set new standards for technologies in which we excel, to behave not as rule-takers but as great independent actors on the world stage, to do free trade deals for the benefit and prosperity of the British people."
"That was the vision of Brexit we fought for; that was the vision the Prime Minister rightly described last year."
"That is the prize."
"And if the Prime Minister can fix that vision once again before us then I believe she can deliver a great Brexit for Britain, with a positive and self-confident approach that will unite this party, unite this House, and unite the country as well."
"Conservatives Most Popular OpinionTags: Boris Johnson My pleasure."
"I think education is the single most important thing that we Conservatives believe in."
"In the sense that it is the tool that every kid should have to make the most of their talents and their opportunities, and a great education is the job of the state to provide to absolutely everybody."
"What's been happening in the UK over the last few years is that too many schools have been falling behind in their per capita provision."
"So what I want to do, day one, is level up and make sure that everybody, primary schools and secondary schools, get the funding they need."
"We're also announcing today something for special educational needs schools as well."
"What we want to do is to give parents the ability, where they think there's need, to go for special educational needs schools, for free schools and we will back that up and we'll support them."
"I think very often local authorities need the extra help to make sure they have enough provision nearby."
"Well actually, of course, as the great Tunisian scholar and sage Ibn Khaldun pointed out as early as the 14th century, there are plenty of taxes that you can cut which will actually increase your revenues and there are ways of making sure that you can stimulate growth, you stimulate enterprise and you get more in."
"But what is certainly true is at the moment Sophy there is cash available."
"Well there's headroom of about £22-£25 billion at the moment and…    That's right but there's definitely headroom and if you look at February alone the Chancellor's revenues exceeded his expenditure."
"Well believe me there is cash now available."
"I think at the moment there is the headroom available and we intend to use it."
"I also think you can do some great things to stimulate economic growth with tax cuts."
"If it's borrowing to finance great infrastructure projects and there is an opportunity to borrow at low rates and do things for the long term benefit of the country then we should do them."
"But there are some projects- don't forget in this country we are spending about £250 billion on public procurement per year of one kind or another."
"Don't tell me there aren't significant savings to be found in the way that we spend that money."
"I'm prepared to borrow to finance certain great objectives but overall we will keep fiscal responsibility and keep going with the general trajectory of ensuring that this country pays its way and lives within its means."
"But you can do that with some sensible tax cuts that will stimulate growth, stimulate enterprise, get more revenue in and also use the headroom we've currently got to spend on things that I think are really important, like education and policing."
"I think we should be looking at lifting people on low incomes out of tax, lifting the thresholds for national insurance and I would remind you that that's where my priority is."
"When I was Mayor of London we led the way, for instance with the London living wage and I think lifting NI contribution thresholds would be another good thing to do."
"The living wage...    Well I certainly believe in lifting the living wage and I'm not going to set a figure now."
"As you know there is a process by which that figure is determined."
"I thoroughly support the impartiality and the fact-based way that is done and wouldn't want to interpose my own judgement now on this show."
"But look at what I did when I was Mayor."
"We massively expanded the living wage."
"We put cash into the pockets of the poorest families across London."
"I'm incredibly proud of that."
"This country needs higher pay, not higher taxes and that's what I want to achieve."
"It's at or around £10 or so."
"Sorry I was talking about the London living wage, forgive me."
"I'm talking about the London living wage, forgive me."
"Believe me, I believe in expanding the living wage where it's possible."
"I don't mean literally that we're going to die Sophy if we don't leave."
"I think that what we will face is a political extinction, and literally I think we will have a drift away from not just from the Conservative Party but from both the main parties."
"I think it will suffer very considerably from an electorate that feels they can't trust politicians to deliver on their promises."
"This is the old proroguing question."
"Yes    What's much more important is that MPs understand the gravity of the situation and behave with responsibility and recognise that the only way to restore trust and confidence in politics is to get this thing done."
"I don't like the idea of proroguing."
"I'm not remotely attracted to it, but you know MPs have got to understand it's their responsibility to get this thing done and that was by far the best solution."
"I don't want to prorogue Parliament nor do I expect to."
"I don't think that's going to be necessary and I think that its's far more important that MPs focus on where we are."
"Because politics has changed since March 29th and people can see than unless we get Brexit done there is going to be a continuing haemorrhage of trust and of confidence in my party and Labour as well."
"I mean Labour, spectacular incompetence, managed to go backwards in the council elections as well."
"Well actually I think that our European friends and partners can see very clearly what the answer is."
"Well I don't think that they are going to want a disorderly Brexit of any kind and it's not in their interests."
"There's no reason why they should want the sudden imposition of tariffs and quotas."
"SR; So you're just ignoring what they're saying?"
"No, well I think it's possibly the case that they would say that at this particular stage in the negotiations."
"You would expect them to say that kind of thing."
"We are going to work very hard to show our earnestness, our sincerity."
"What we want to do is take the elements of the current Withdrawal Agreement, which really doesn't work at all it's a defunct agreement but there are some good bits, like the bit about citizens."
"We should pass that through."
"The money, the £39 billion, I would suspend that in creative ambiguity wait until we get a deal and then solve the problems of the Northern Irish border."
"Well, let's see."
"That is not the objective I want."
"That is not the objective I seek."
"I think it would be very very strange if the EU was to go for a solution in which their vehicles coming to the UK, in huge numbers by the way, face tariffs."
"There are some people, like Mervyn King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, who thinks that that would be very good and we would rake in €35 billion in tariffs."
"Because after all the EU has a colossal surplus with us in goods."
"I don't want that at all."
"That's not the way to go."
"It doesn't make any sense."
"The way forward, Sophy, is to have a standstill in the current arrangements."
"You do, but for the reasons I've just given, I think they have a powerful incentive to get it done, and I go further."
"I go further, and say that, actually, when you consider they have now, since March 29th, they have a large contingent of Eurosceptic British MEPs in Strasbourg, a continual thorn in their side, they are going to want to get this thing over the line."
"That was not the context of the conversation at all."
"My words have been totally taken out of context."
"I'll tell you."
"I was being told that there was absolutely no way that the UK could leave the Single Market and the Customs Union and that we would have to stay run by the EU, and I don't think that is the case."
"I think, actually, if you look at my record, as somebody who has campaigned for business, who has stuck for business through thick and thin, I don't think there's a politician like it."
"I can't think of anybody in my party or any party that has stuck up for financial services in London during some very difficult times, and indeed I can't think of anybody who has gone around the world championing UK businesses and driving home the message about this or that contract and genuinely acting as an ambassador and evangelist for UK business."
"That is what I will be if I'm lucky enough to be elected."
"Of course I feel very bad about all the consular cases in Iran, particularly Nazanin."
"Yes I do."
"I feel sorry for her, for her daughter, for her husband Richard and I've said this many many times."
"I feel a deep sense of anguish for what she has been going through."
"When it comes to responsibility for what she is suffering I think that is incredibly important that we in the UK do not unwittingly give aid and succour to the people who are really responsible, which is not the Foreign Office, not the former Foreign Secretary, and no-one in London is responsible for incarcerating Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe."
"The people who are responsible are the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, and anything you do to exculpate them is, I think, a great shame."
"Would you say that they were wholly responsible?"
"Would you say they were wholly responsible or only partly responsible?"
"Of course, I do feel a deep sense of anguish about it as I have said and I have apologised several times in the House of Commons and elsewhere, but it is very very important that in this conversation we don't allow whatever I may have said or done to cloud the issue, which is that the people incarcerating Nazanin and others are Khatim Sulaimani and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard."
"They are doing it illegally, they are doing it inhumanely and they should release her and others, and I think it's very very important that we focus on that message."
"In a wholly satirical way by the way."
"No, I think if you look at each and every one of those columns or articles you'll find that the quotations have been wrenched out of context, in many cases made to mean the opposite of what was intended, and actually look at my record whilst I was Mayor of London."
"If you want to look at somebody who's campaigned for gender equality, look at what we did in the Foreign Office where had a huge campaign for 12 years of quality education for every girl in the world that was massively successful, it was taken up by other countries."
"Look at the way I ran London."
"We had huge campaigns to protect the rights of women and particularly against violence against women, and I think sometimes there is a tendency, as I say, take words out of context rather than to look at what I actually did."
"On the contrary, I take full responsibility for everything I've said."
"Just look at what I've actually done."
"When I took over running London eleven years ago, the city was in the grip of the biggest recession in that we've known for 50 years."
"We had riots, heaven knows what we had to go through to get ready for the Olympics."
"I took full responsibility for all those things."
"I took responsibility for one thing that was the crime wave afflicting London and I took personal responsibility for it and actually, by dint of some very tough measures, by getting the police out on the street, by giving them the power, the political top cover to do stop and search, we got the murder rate down by 50%, under 100 a year, which is an amazing thing for a city the size of London."
"Yes, I did take personal responsibility for those things and I take personal responsibility for everything I say and do."
"No, everything."
"I take personal responsibility, most importantly, for the vote to leave the European Union."
"I played a part in that campaign and I'm very proud of what we did but I take personal responsibility now for what is happening to our country, for the drift and the dither, and the indecision , and the failure to be sufficiently robust in the negotiations which we've seen so far and what I want to add now is my own ability, I think, to lead us out of this mess, to get Brexit done by October 31st and then to do for the whole country what we did in London which is to bring it together."
"We're a great country."
"We're a great economy, let's believe in ourselves."
"I think we've spent three years being told by people 'we can't do x,y, and z because we're not up to it', 'we can't leave the European Union because it's all too alarming.'"
"Actually, it's not."
"This is an extraordinary country capable of doing extraordinary things."
"We will get ready, in a very sensible and sober way, to come out on October 31st, with no deal if we absolutely have to."
"But we will get a deal with our friends and partners that provides security for business, for investment snf allows us to carry on, and then we will get on with the agenda I've been talking about."
"Ashurbanipal, he was pretty tough on his enemies."
"His great grandfather Sennacherib, of course, came down like the wolf on the fold and his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold."
"I can't remember what Ashurbanipal did with his enemies."
"This election is by no means over, Sophy."
"There's a long way to go."
"I'm full of admiration for lots of people in the Conservative Party."
"I've never known a time where there's been so much talent on the Conservative benches."
"I admire Jeremy very much and whatever happens he will not be in a dog kennel, I can tell you that much, with or without a chain around his neck."
"That's a promise."
"I'm doing loads of debates."
"How many are there?"
"I've just done you."
"I've just been interrogated by you for a long time."
"How much tougher can that be?"
"Is there any experience more brutal and pummelling and tougher than that?"
"I bet there isn't."
"I'm doing loads of debates and I humbly submit, Sophy, there can be no more interrogational catechism more devastating than Sophy Ridge on Sunday."
"If anyone can get through Sophy Ridge on Sunday they deserve a medal in my view.I have spent a fair bit of the last two months tramping the streets of London and talking to hundreds of people who were caught up in the riots whose businesses were attacked or who were just appalled at what they saw and I have a pretty good idea of what Londoners want."
"They want to make sure that nothing like it happens again and so I can tell you that as long as I am mayor- I will not allow police numbers to fall below a level that I believe is safe or reasonable for a great city."
"Police numbers are up by 1000 on when I was elected and the number of special constables has doubled to more than 5200 and I pledge now that I am going to keep it that way and yet we all know it is not just about numbers."
"The Londoners I have talked to want our police to have the backing they need to deal with thugs and looters in the way they need to be dealt with and if you look at the record of new commissioner Bernard Hogan Howe you can see how clearly he understands the Capone principle that if you crack down on the small stuff the big stuff starts to take care of itself."
"And let me tell you that in Merseyside he used ANPR to round up every car he could find that was either untaxed or uninsured he put them all “thousands of vehicles” on the central reservation of some road leading into Liverpool and the drivers of those cars had two choices they could either come and claim the vehicle in which case they would be arrested or else they could leave it and Mr Hogan Howe would have it crushed and the result was that thousands of vehicles were crushed, and crime fell by 40 per cent, and so my message to London’s criminal fraternity is tax and insure your car or- you’ll get it back for Christmas as a small cube from the crusher with love."
"And in the same spirit of zero tolerance, I reckon we need to get back to where we were before 1988 and to make it clear that if people swear at the police then they must expect to be arrested."
"Not just because it is wrong to expect officers to endure profanities though I happen to think it is but because if people feel there are no comebacks, no boundaries, no retribution for the small stuff then I am afraid they will go on to commit worse crimes."
"And yet if 75 per cent of the rioters and the looters were criminals and 50 per cent had 15 or more convictions we have to recognise that 25 per cent had no record and what Londoners also want is for everyone “politicians, teachers, police, parents” to sort out the underlying issues that encouraged them to riot."
"One of the very best things to come from those events is the fierce desire of people to help to bring communities together and to show that those looters do not stand for London."
"I will tell you who did stand up for London- It was the chap who sat on a looter’s head."
"It was the woman who made that great speech in Hackney and scared them off and the restaurant workers who fought them off with rolling pins and saucepans."
"It was the broom Brigade of Battersea."
"These people represented the true spirit of London and our country and across the city there are people who have been spurred to get involved to help with the groups that are already doing so much good work."
"That is why we set up Team London, to make it easy for you to become a mentor."
"To read to kids in schools, to help with the 25 new supplementary schools that we are setting up to help give some of the most difficult kids the discipline and boundaries and love they need."
"We are cutting rates of reoffending with a special unit at Feltham."
"We are sponsoring resettlement brokers so that those who have been imprisoned are helped back into society and together with London business we have launched a huge apprenticeship programme."
"With 28000 young people so far gaining a place and 80 per cent of them either going on to a job  or to education and with the help of banks and accountancy firms and legal firms and insurance firms we have massively expanded."
"The London living wage so that the poorest 10,000 in the city have had an extra £60m in their pockets."
"Yet no one can afford to pay the London living wage or any wage at all if their business is going under and that is why the best thing we can do for those young people is to create the platform on which business can build and grow in difficult times."
"Our job in government is to make London an ever more attractive place to live and invest in."
"That means low crime and crime is down 9 per cent over the last three years."
"To pick a period entirely at random the murder rate is down to levels not seen since the 1970s, the youth murder rate has been roughly halved, bus crime is down 30 per cent, and thanks partly to the ban on alcohol, crime on the tube has fallen 20 per cent and I can tell you that we now have the safest Tube network in the whole of Europe."
"And yes, I know it is crowded sometimes and I know it is hot but that is why it so utterly crucial that we maintain the investment at the current neo-Victorian level because in spite of the recession we are carrying record numbers on both tube and buses."
"We need new track, new trains, new signalling and air conditioning and let me assure you that we are not just spending money for the hell of it."
"In the last three or so years to pick a period at random we have saved £2bn from Tfl- we have had a 25 per cent cut in the number of directors, we have vacated 23 buildings across London, with a reduction in desks of 4232, we have flogged those desks and those offices, and those executive washrooms, and we have turned them into machines, and equipment that move you faster and more comfortably around London."
"The Victoria line is three miles an hour faster than it was three years ago and we have Jubilee line trains arriving every two minutes or less."
"Thanks to the common sense of this Coalition government we not only have the Tube upgrades, we have Crossrail as well."
"As Thameslink, which is a north-south Crossrail and conference I will not allow that investment to be jeopardised for short term political gain."
"This morning I went to the Lucchini factory in Manchester, where even now they are making the wheels for London’s new rolling stock."
"I talked to some of the 187 people whose jobs are assured by the continuing growth of London ‘s transport infrastructure and I say to my friends in the treasury FD Roosevelt had the new deal, I give you the wheel deal."
"You help us to invest in London transport and we’ll supply the locomotive of the UK economy."
"If we can keep cutting crime and keep improving transport then we can help give London business the conditions it needs to get people into work and through the downturn."
"There is one overarching philosophy behind everything we do in City Hall that can be traced to a saying of Mahatma Gandhi, who prophesied in 1948 that the future of India lay in its 700,000 villages."
"As anyone who has been to India can testify, Gandhi was wrong."
"It is unromantic but true that the future of the world lies in cities but he was right in this deeper sense that people yearn for the memory of the village."
"That Eden from which we were all expelled and so everything we do is about putting the village back into the city."
"We are on target to build a record 50,000 affordable homes over four years and we will do even more over the next four."
"But we are also insisting on homes that are big enough for families and with rooms big enough for human beings rather than hobbits."
"By next year this mayoralty will have planted 50,000 trees including street trees and we are not only protecting back gardens from development and consecrating green space."
"But thanks to the work of Rosie Boycott we have found 1250 growing spaces in London ‘s waste ground where 38000 volunteers have been growing food crops of all kind."
"It is apparently an antidote to depression and it is a good occupation for the idle hands of young people and if you want to take part join Team London."
"That is what I mean by putting the village back into the city and there is nothing more villagey than the sight of someone sailing elegantly past- bolt upright on one of those big burly blue bicycles."
"The bikes are going west; they are going east and soon they will be gathering themselves for the great push north and south."
"Next year you will be able to go by hire bike from Canary wharf to Hammersmith from Camden Town to Clapham."
"And though the number of thefts has risen since I last talked to you."
"I cannot hide it- from eight to 18."
"We have recaptured every one, we have punished the culprits and it is still about 2000 fewer than were nicked over the same period in another city."
"I will not name and guess how many were looted by the looters?"
"None."
"I don’t know whether we should be flattered or vaguely insulted but the only thing safer than the bike hire stands were bookshops."
"But if “ as I hope” those amazingly low figures show some dim respect for common property, for something that is meant for everyone, then that is what I mean by putting the village back into the city."
"That is why Barbara Windsor is so often to be seen encouraging people, through Team London, to have street parties."
"Because all the evidence is that where people know each other by their first names crime comes down."
"If people know each other by their first names they don’t raid their local shops and if we can get all that right- crime down, better transport, invest in the skills of young people, put the village back in the city."
"If we can get the right tax and regulatory framework then British enterprise will do the rest and there could not be a better international calling card for British firms than the Olympic site."
"Ahead of schedule, under budget."
"I was looking out of my window at city hall and as my eye swept the horizon I suddenly saw the Arcelormittal orbit."
"And I know there are art critics who will say it is a mad mayoral vanity project and that orbit is where it belongs but it creates a much needed focus for the park it is very largely privately sponsored- the steel comes from Bolton, and in the same way the Olympics are boosting jobs across the country, the decking comes from Poole, the security fencing comes from Wolverhampton, kerbs and paving come from Northampton, the piling for the aquatics centre comes from Oldham, velodrome seating comes from Barnsley, the velodrome is rubbed with rhubarb, to give it that beautiful rosy hue."
"Where does it come from and such is the enthusiasm for the Olympics and Olympic investment that I can today reveal that in the pas de Calais area of France where the Uzbek and Senegal rowers are training, the authorities have decided that their region is to be rebaptised ‘une partie de grande Bretagne’."
"Conference I believe we have a record to be proud of- we have frozen council tax for three years and effectively cut it by 10 per cent."
"We have put oyster on the overground."
"We have delivered a 24 hour freedom pass of a kind I hardly dare mention in Manchester in case they get jealous    The last bendy bus will go by Xmas and in the new year you will see a new generation open platform bus, built in the UK with British technology."
"After more than 450 years since it was lost by Mary Tudor- we have recaptured Calais from the French as the burgers yield to the soft power of the Olympics."
"I am proud of what we have done but we have so much more to do and together with my team from City Hall we will be bringing forward a new manifesto in the next months comprising- new river crossings, new tube lines and stations, funded by tax increment financing."
"New ideas for the betterment of all Londoners and to take our city forward not back, we did it before."
"Hundreds of people in this hall helped us to deliver sensible moderate one-nation conservative government in London and I have no doubt it will be a tough fight but with your help we can do it again thank you and I hope very much that we will be able.”I was at the UN general assembly in NY the other day and talking to the foreign minister of another country    -      I won’t say which one, since I must preserve my reputation for diplomacy, but let’s just say they have an economy about the size of Australia (though getting smaller, alas)      plenty of snow, nuclear missiles, balalaikas, oligarchs, leader who strips to the waist     you get the picture    After a few tense exchanges my counterpart gave a theatrical sigh and said that any difficulties we had in our relationship were all Britain’s fault    “It was you guys who imposed democracy on us in 1990”     I was a bit startled by this, and I decided I couldn’t let it go unchallenged, and I said     “hang on, Sergei,” I said; “aren’t you in favour of democracy?” And then I asked for a show of hands in the room…      “All those in favour of democracy please show”, I said    and you would have thought that this was a relatively uncontroversial thing      a bit like asking Maria von Trapp whether she was in favour of raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens    and I am proud to say that the entire UK side of the room raised their hands as one to show that    democracy was indeed one of our favourite things     but much to my amazement our opposite numbers just kept their hands on the table and gave us what we diplomats call the hairy eyeball     and of course they felt I was winding them up; and there is a sense in which my question was semi-satirical     But the exchange was also deeply serious, and revealing about the way the world has changed     -      or perhaps the way in which it has failed to change –    since that moment of exhilaration in 1990    when the Berlin wall had come down, and the Soviet union was coming to an end, and some of us – and yes, I was one – really BELIEVED that we had come to a moment of ideological resolution    and that after seven frozen and sometimes terrifying decades of communist totalitarian rule     -      the gulags, the oppression of eastern europe: all the things that have been conveniently forgotten by the Dave and Deirdre Sparts who were still singing about Lenin’s red flag last week at the Labour party conference…     We genuinely thought that after all that misery and slaughter     we were seeing the final triumph of that conglomerate of western liberal values and ideals that unite the people in this room     not just free markets – but all the things that we then believed, in that brief shining moment, were the essential concomitants of free-market capitalism    …rule of law, human rights, independent judiciary, habeas corpus, equalities of race and gender and sexual orientation     the eternal and inalienable right of the media to make fun of the politicians     We assumed then that this political freedom went with economic freedom     like buying a two for one ice cream snickers bar (only free markets could produce something so ingenious)     and a copy of private eye (free speech of a kind still unknown in much of the planet)     like two sides of liberty’s golden coin     and yet I have to tell you that both sides of that coin have been tarnished and devalued over the last two decades     and we must be humble and realistic enough to accept that in many eyes the notion that we could endlessly expand the realm of liberal democracy was badly damaged, alas,     by the invasion of Iraq in 2003    and symmetrically our model of free-market anglo-saxon capitalism    as practised in London and New York    was seriously discredited by the Crash of 2008, and the global suspicion of bankers    and we have taken those twin blows like punches to the midriff; and we have been winded    and sometimes lacking in confidence in these ideals;     and if you look at the course of events in the last ten years I am afraid you can make the case that it is partly as a result of that lack of western self-confidence     - political, military, economic -    that in some material ways the world has got less safe, more dangerous, more worrying     After a long post-war period in which the world was broadly getting more peaceful     the number of deaths in conflict has risen from 49,000 in 2010 to 167,000 last year    The global number of refugees is up by 30 per cent on 2013 to 46m     and though much of this refugee crisis can be attributed to the war in Syria, it is part of a wider arc of instability that sweeps across from Iraq to Libya    and this matters profoundly to our country     because it is the continuing savagery of the Asad regime against the people of Aleppo    and the complicity of the Russians in committing what are patently war crimes    - bombing hospitals, when they know they are hospitals and nothing but hospitals    that is making it impossible for peace negotiations to begin     and that is prolonging a migration crisis that at one stage last year had overwhelmed Europe’s ability to cope    and when the violent extremism of Daesh is erupting like boils across the face of the Middle east     we are inevitably seeing the contagion spread to cities in Germany, France, Belgium – and in Britain as well     and if that threat to travel continues to have a palpable chilling effect on tourism     and perhaps even on trade      then for a great trading nation like Britain that is a matter of deep concern     and then there is perhaps an even more pernicious phenomenon    -      stemming, however unfairly, from the disastrous events in iraq,    which is the temptation of more and more governments to take this instability and insecurity as an excuse to move away from democracy     Across Africa you can see for the first time in decades that governments are gradually becoming more authoritarian    The number of African countries rated free or partly free has fallen from 34 to 29 in the last ten years    There are 4 African presidents who are currently re-writing their national constitutions to tighten their grip on power    and I am afraid there are plenty of countries large and small    where the idea of multi-party representative democracy is obstinately failing to catch on     and that is because there is a view that has gained ground over the last few years    that Fukuyama was wrong     that there is no symmetry in our golden coin    and that you CAN have economic prosperity without political and social freedom    and indeed there is a view now in many parts of the world that the ONLY way to ensure prosperity and stability is to suppress freedom     -      to crack down on pesky NGOs and irritating journalists and independent judges     and generally to deprecate the western liberal consensus about how a society should be ordered…     And so if I have one message for you this afternoon, my friends, it is that this illiberal analysis is deeply and dangerously wrong    and that these social and political freedoms    Freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom to practice whatever religion you want and to live your life as you please    These freedoms are not inimical to prosperity – they are in fact essential to sustained growth    This is not the moment to cast aspersions on any other country    where lack of freedom is hindering economic growth    I can prove my point simply by asking you to look at the society we live in    a 21 century Britain that incarnates that symmetry    why have we got more tech wizards in London than any other city in Europe?"
"Is it because the politicians decided to embark on a soviet style programme of training people to do tech?"
"On the contrary, I had no idea what tech was – though later claimed credit for it    It was because London acquired a deserved reputation as the greatest city on earth, a great jiving funkapolitan melting-pot where provided you did nothing to damage the interests of others and provided you obeyed the law you could make of your life pretty much what you wanted    and that’s why we lead in all those creative and cultural sectors and that’s why we have the best universities    because the best minds from across the world are meeting in some of the best pubs and bars and nightclubs     like subatomic particles colliding in a cyclotron and they are producing those flashes of innovation that are essential for long term economic success    and it will not surprise you to know that Britain is ranked among the top three most innovative societies on earth    America is 4th and China is 25th     and indeed the entire top ten innovative societies are free market liberal democracies    And that is why we are still the fastest growing European economy, according to the OECD    and this new and dynamic government led by Theresa May is working not just to ensure that this success is felt by everyone    in a country that works for everyone     but I also believe we should have absolutely no shame or embarrassment in championing our ideals around the world     and in this era of dithering and dubitation this should be the message of global Britain to the world:     that we stick up for free markets as vigorously as we stick up for democracy and human rights     and when all is said and done, my friends    -      and I know that not everyone will agree with this, but what the hell – I believe that vote on june 23 was for economic freedom and political freedom as well    Over the last couple of months I have sat in all kinds of EU meetings    vast and ruminative feasts of lunch or dinner in the castles of Mitteleuropa     washed down with the finest wines known to man    and on one occasion a splendid breakfast that seemed to stretch, for course after course, from 8 am to 11    and I have enjoyed them all     I have made friends, alliances     and had wonderful conversations in my various euro-creoles     but I have to tell any lingering gloomadon-poppers that never once have I felt that this country would be in any way disadvantaged by extricating ourselves from the EU treaties    and indeed there are some ways in which we will be liberated to be more active on the world stage than ever before    because we are not leaving Europe    We will remain committed to all kinds of European cooperation – at an intergovernmental level    whether it is maintaining sanctions against Russia for what is happening in Ukraine    or sending our navy to help the Italians stem the migrant flow through the central Mediterranean    But we will also be able to speak up more powerfully with our own distinctive voice    leading the world as we now are, in imposing a ban on ivory     helping to save the elephant in a way that the disunited EU is unable to do;     in fact we have an absurd situation in which the EU is actually trying to veto the ivory ban in spite of having a president called Donald Tusk    or relaunching the cause of global free trade that has been stalled since the failure of the Doha round     and I can think of few more positive forces in the global economy than the world’s fifth richest economy    taking back control not just of our democracy and our borders and our cash    but taking back control of our tariff schedules in Geneva, so that we can galvanise free trade, break the log jam     and as our new PM has rightly said – we can now become the global champions and agitators for this phenomenon     doing free trade deals with countries around the world – as Liam will do     deals that will continue the process of lifting billions out of poverty    and that is why the world needs Global Britain more than ever     as a campaigner for the values we believe in    a catalyst for change and reform and economic and political freedom     in a world that has lost confidence in those values     And of course there are those who say that we can’t do it – that we are too small, too feeble, too geopolitically reduced to have that kind of influence     I think of the pogonologically challenged Labour party, where they literally want to abolish the armed services and to keep our new nuclear submarines as a demented job creation programme – sending them to sea without any nukes aboard so that the whole nation is turned into a kind of glorified military capon    firing blanks     I am not going to pretend that this country is something we are not     Every day I go into an office so vast that you could comfortably fit two squash courts and so dripping with gilt bling that it looks like something from the Kardashians     and as I sit at the desk of George Nathaniel Curzon I sometimes reflect that this was once the nerve centre of an empire that was 7 times the size of the Roman empire at its greatest extent under Trajan    and when I go into the Map Room of Palmerston I cannot help remembering that this country over the last two hundred years has directed the invasion or conquest of 178 countries – that is most of the members of the UN      -      not a point I majored on in New York at the UNGA     and that is because those days are gone forever    and that is a profoundly good thing     It is good for Britain and good for the world that in the last 60 years – in living memory – those responsibilities have been taken away     and yet it would be a fatal mistake now to underestimate what this country is doing or what it can do     because in spite of Iraq, it is simply not the case that every military intervention has been a disaster     Far from it…     Look at the achievement in Sierra Leone, where we were instrumental not just in ending the civil war, but in wiping out Ebola    Look at Somalia, where my predecessor William Hague helped initiate a bold programme to tackle the pirates that plagued the coast of that country     and together with a coalition of other European countries      British ships took them on, with all the courage and decisiveness of our 19th century forebears    and the result?"
"Before the anti-pirate campaign, their depredations had cost the world economy about $7 bn a year    When Britain stepped in, the attacks stopped altogether – and it is a happy fact that since 2012 there have been more Hollywood films about Somali pirates starring Tom Hanks than there have been pirate attacks    Of course we don’t want to wield our hard power; we think an age before we do so     But when we give our armed services clear and achievable missions we can still be remarkably effective     and with 2 per cent of our GDP spent on defence we will be the leading military player in western Europe for the foreseeable future     and our hard power, conference, is dwarfed by a phenomenon that the pessimists never predicted when we unbundled the British empire    and that is soft power    -      the vast and subtle and pervasive extension of British influence around the world that goes with having the language that was invented and perfected in this country     and now has more speakers than any other language on earth     and up the creeks and inlets of every continent on earth there go the gentle kindly gunboats of british soft power      captained by Jeremy Clarkson  - a prophet more honoured abroad, alas, than in his own country       or JK Rowling who is worshipped by young people in some Asian countries as a kind of divinity     or just the BBC – and no matter how infuriating and shamelessly anti-Brexit they can sometimes be    I think the Beeb is the single greatest and most effective ambassador for our culture and our values    and it was Sergei lavrov himself who told me that he had not only watched our version of war and peace, but thought it was “very well done”    and that, from the Kremlin, was praise     and if you want final proof of our irresistible soft power I remind you as I always do that this country not only invented or codified just about every sport or game known to humanity    but this year it was our athletes – from a country that can boast only 1 pc of the world’s population – that came second in the Olympic and paralympic games    and I hope my friends in Beijing will not mind if I point out that their teams had 1.4 bn people to draw on     Yes, it is true as I have said that the world is not as healthy or as safe as it should be    and it is true that in 2016 we are worryingly afflicted by war and terrorism and the new perils of cyber-crime     and by the painful refusal of many parts of the world to accept what you and I might see as common sense    that free markets and free societies go together     but in case you are remotely tempted to despair I urge you to look not at the problems    but at the successes that these free institutions have helped to engender    For all its problems, life expectancy in Africa has risen astonishingly as that continent has entered the global economic system    In 2000 the average Ethiopian lived to only 47 – it is now 64 and climbing; in Zambia the increase has been from 44 years to 60     in 1990 37 per cent of the world’s population lived in poverty – that is down to 9.6 pc today     and yes, that is partly thanks to UK spending on development aid       - £300 m a year to Ethiopia alone     but above all it is our economic ideas, our beliefs, our values that continue to lift the world out of poverty      and that must continue to be our ambition     It has been an extraordinary experience to have been FSec for the last few months     and together with my fantastic ministerial colleagues      Alan Duncan for Europe and America     Joyce Anelay for the Commonwealth and UN     Tobias Ellwood for Africa and the Middle east    Alok Sharma for Asia and the Pacific    we have made literally hundreds of trips    cats cradling the world in a truly stupefying accumulation of airmiles    and I have confirmed to myself that we have in the Foreign Office the finest diplomatic service in the world      - covering far more countries than the French with only 70 per cent of the budget     and I am giving nothing away when I say we have the world’s most superb intelligence services      and when I am making a speech in a foreign city I look around the heaving room and become aware of a phenomenon that I think people in this country are barely aware of    and that is that of the Brits now alive and born in this country    fully one in ten is now living abroad    we are talking 5 or 6 m people – a population the size of Scotland    No other rich country – according to the World Bank - has a diaspora on that scale    No other country is such a formidable exporter of human talent      business people, lawyers, teachers, prospectors, adventurers      poets, painters, whisky-sellers, French knicker sellers     to France     No other country is turned so tangibly outwards and into the world    and what they take with them is not just a knowledge of English or the cast of the Archers     or which game has a position called silly mid off     but an instinctive set of values    and whether they are retired British teachers working as monitors in the Ukrainian war zone     or Met police officers training their counterparts in the parts of Syria held by the moderate opposition     I find that these Brits are respected and admired – in sometimes unexpected ways - by ordinary people around the world     and in an age of anxiety and uncertainty it is surely obvious that the values of global Britain are needed more than ever    and though we can never be complacent, and though we can never take our position for granted,  Churchill was right    when he said that the empires of the future will be empires of the mind    and in expressing our values I believe that Global Britain is a soft power superpower    and that we can be immensely proud of what    we are achieving.Good afternoon my friends and fellow ConHomers."
"It is great to be here in Birmingham where so many thoroughfares in the city are already named after our superb Conservative Mayor."
"I know this conference is going to be a staggering success because just in the last couple of days about a dozen far left momentum activists have kindly pledged their loyalty by ringing my private mobile phone."
"I put them straight on to Brandon."
"As Paul Goodman might confirm, I am not naturally of a timid disposition."
"It is not my way to confide my innermost fears."
"But since this is only a fringe meeting, unlikely to be widely reported, I will reveal that I have one overriding anxiety about the current political scene, both domestic and international."
"It isn’t global warming or terrorism or Rouhani’s Iran or Putin’s Russia – real though all those challenges are."
"It’s not the negotiating tactics of Jean-Claude Juncker– before or after lunch."
"It’s not even the economic and political catastrophe that would befall us in the event of a Corbyn government – horrifying though I find that idea."
"My friends, there is only one thing I really worry about in this critical autumn of 2018, and that is that after 200 years this oldest and most successful of all political parties should somehow lose confidence in its basic belief in freedom."
"And that after 1000 years of independence this country might really lose confidence in its democratic institutions."
"And that we should be so demoralised and so exhausted as to submit those institutions – forever – to foreign rule."
"If I have a function here today – it is to try, with all humility, to put some lead in the collective pencil, to stop what seems to me to be a ridiculous seeping away of our self-belief, and to invite you to feel realistic and justified confidence in what we can do."
"Not in a spirit of jingo or glib partisanship, because I know that this is a time of trial."
"Indeed it is precisely because our position is so serious, and the decisions before us are so vital, that it is more necessary than ever that we feel a quiet and legitimate confidence in our country, that we believe in our basic Conservative ideas and values, and that we believe in our democracy."
"That basic belief in conservatism ought to be a little easier, frankly, after the events of last week at the Labour conference."
"I know that we can’t use too many references from the 1970s or 1980s, but surely to goodness we can take this Tony Benn tribute act and wallop it for six."
"Not by imitating them – not by capering insincerely on Labour turf: we won’t get anywhere by metaphorically acquiring beards and string vests and allotments – but by systematically pointing out the damage they would do."
"They want to spend literally hundreds of billions renationalising the utilities."
"They want to clobber business with new taxes, with workers’ soviets on the board."
"They would wreck the economy."
"They would drive away investment."
"And they would consign the population to years of further tedium, rancour and uncertainty – as if the last three years were not enough – by promising another Brexit referendum."
"Another one!"
"As Brenda from Bristol would put it."
"We cannot must not and will not let this weaselly cabal of superannuated Marxists and Hugo Chavez-admiring anti-semitism-condoning Kremlin apologists anywhere near the government of this country."
"And that means, instead of aping Corbyn, we have to take our basic Conservative ideas and fit them to the problems of today."
"It is true that the old Conservative buzzword of choice has a different resonance these days."
"In some respects we have more choice than you can shake a stick at."
"We can watch anything anywhere any time."
"We can zoom off to AirBNBs on cheapo flights."
"Our food is better, our cars are faster and safer, our life expectancy is certainly a lot longer."
"And yet there is one huge difference between a baby-boomer like me and all you ConHome millennials out there."
"One cardinal way in which opportunity has declined."
"And that is in the scope and power of the younger generation, with their own resources, to buy somewhere to live that they can call their own."
"It is a disgraceful fact that we now have lower rates of owner occupation – for under 40s – than the French or the Germans."
"That reflects the failure of governments for the last 30 years to build enough housing."
"But it is also a massive opportunity for us Tories."
"If we rise to the challenge, if we get it right, it is an open goal, because this is one of those critical issues where in the phrase of Chris Patten the facts of life do always turn out to be Conservative."
"And Labour’s instincts actually clash in a fundamental way with the instincts of ordinary people."
"Worse still, Labour’s political interests – which centre on the building and control of state-owned housing – are diametrically opposed to the interests of most families."
"I remember when I was first absolutely certain that we Tories were right about housing."
"I was a reporter on the Wolverhampton Express and Star, not far from here."
"And I went out to see a couple who were complaining about damp."
"It was a terrible scene."
"They were sitting there and with the heating on full blast and a baby crying, and the condensation dripping down the window, and there were these great black spores all over the wall."
"The chap was in his socks in an armchair and in a state of total despair."
"He was worried about the baby’s cough – which was getting worse."
"The council wouldn’t do anything, and he felt he couldn’t do anything – because it was not his property, and I could see that he felt somehow unmanned by the situation."
"And I felt very sorry for them both – because they were total prisoners of the system."
"And I thought what a difference it would make to that family if they had been able to take back control – to coin a phrase."
"To buy that flat."
"And since then I have lost count of the times – and I bet you have too – when I have been out campaigning, and someone has told me on the doorstep that they would vote Conservative forever out of sheer gratitude to us for letting them buy their own home."
"That is what people want – the pride of having a place they own."
"A sense of excitement that has probably been common to humanity since the first couple took vacant possession of the first mud hut in Mohenjo Daro."
"And yet Labour hates that instinct."
"And Corbyn hates that instinct."
"Because although they live themselves in posh Islington townhouses they would much rather that the electorate stayed in social rented accommodation, passed by hereditary right – as, incredibly, these state-owned dwellings are – from one generation to the next."
"They like it that way because they know that as soon as you get a mortgage, as soon as you have a stake in society, you are less likely to go on strike and you are more likely to vote Conservative."
"And if you stay in social rented accommodation you are more likely to vote Labour."
"But I tell you something ConHomers."
"The paradox is that the Conservative approach not only delivers more homes for private purchase, it delivers more affordable homes as well."
"And if you look at the record of the previous Mayor of London – something the Chancellor might care to consult – you will see that not only did crime come down by 20 per cent and the murder rate by 50 per cent."
"Deaths by fire down 50 per cent."
"Road KSIs down 50 per cent."
"Tube delays down 30 per cent."
"Beautiful new bus, beautiful bikes, millions of trees planted."
"Two new river crossings."
"Crossrail started."
"Record investment, new museums in East London."
"Council tax cut by 20 per cent – well, he did ask for it."
"You will see that we built more homes of all types than Ken Livingstone."
"Precisely because we changed the constricting rules that stopped developments from going ahead."
"And you will see that now under hashtag useless Khan the number of new builds is slumping, because Labour gets tangled in its cynical political objectives, and it is the Conservative approach that gets things done."
"So let’s follow our Conservative instincts, and give millions more young people the chance to become owner-occupiers."
"Let’s encourage more small private builders as my colleague Richard Bacon has suggested for so long."
"Let’s take on the big eight home builders, some of whom are now frankly abusing their dominant position."
"Let’s crack down on landbankers."
"And let’s give councils the incentives they need to encourage growth, and give planning permissions – on those brownfield sites, with long overdue fiscal devolution."
"Give the councils the ability to retain stamp duty, Council tax, business rates, and annual tax on enveloped dwellings, and they will have a motive to go for growth."
"Of course you would need to prevent councils from hiking the business rate, and you would need an equalisation formula because the yields are so different across the country."
"But fiscal devolution is not only Tory in principle."
"It is a way to help councils that are really feeling the squeeze – with the rising cost of services for the elderly."
"And at the same time it is the way to build the homes our children and grandchildren are going to need."
"And when I champion the market economy you can see that I do not claim that it is perfect."
"It is a disgrace that no banker went to jail for the crash of 2008."
"I can see that the utilities have cunning ways of ripping off the consumer."
"But this occasional failure of markets does not mean that state control is better."
"I listened carefully to Corbyn last week, and it was astonishing that he had absolutely nothing to say about the wealth creating sector of the economy."
"The people who get up at the crack of dawn to prepare their shops."
"The grafters and the grifters, the innovators, the entrepreneurs."
"He didn’t mention any successes."
"He did not mention a single sector of the market economy."
"None of it interested him except in so far as he seems to want to nationalise 10 per cent of every company of more than 250 employees."
"The only organisation whose output he singled out for praise was Preston Council."
"I am sure they are an estimable bunch, but Preston Council are not the locomotive of the UK economy."
"We Conservatives know that it is only a strong private sector economy that can pay for superb public services."
"And that is the central symmetry of our one nation Toryism."
"Because it is only by making sure that the streets are safer – and let’s bring back stop and search incidentally, and end this politically correct nonsense that has endangered the lives of young people in our capital – it is only by putting in the infrastructure that enables people to live near their place of work; it is only with a properly funded NHS – and let’s get that funding in now –."
"That you can give people the peace of mind they need."
"It is only by making sure that young people have the skills they need that you create the platform for businesses to grow, and you solve the UK productivity puzzle."
"And it is that virtuous circle, that symmetry that means we must on no account follow Corbyn, and start to treat capitalism as a kind of boo word."
"We can’t lose our faith in competition and choice and markets."
"Indeed we should restate the truth that there is simply no other system that is so miraculously successful in satisfying human wants and needs."
"We should set our taxes at the optimum rate to stimulate investment and growth, and we should be constantly aiming not to increase but to cut taxes."
"Mindful of the insight of the great 14th century Tunisian sage Ibn Khaldoun – picked up by Arthur Laffer – that you can often cut taxes to increase yields."
"We should have as our objective – as soon as possible – to cut taxes for those on low and modest incomes, because it is Conservative to give people back control of their money."
"And instead of treating business as if it were somehow morally dubious, we Conservatives should celebrate its power to do good, and the success of British business."
"We are the only country in the world to have a trade surplus with America in music."
"And our manufacturing ingenuity gets daily more boggling."
"I think of the Uxbridge factory that makes bus stops in Las Vegas."
"Wake up with a hangover in Vegas and the chances are that a little piece of London is shielding you from the elements."
"And the other Uxbridge factory that makes the futuristic wooden display cabinets for duty free Toblerones in every airport in Saudi Arabia."
"Think of that – the invisible hand of the market circling the earth in search of a Toblerone cabinet and pointing at Uxbridge."
"And now is the time to turbo charge those exports, as Liam Fox has said."
"Not long ago I became the first Foreign Secretary to visit Peru for 52 years."
"And as I stood in some glittering Embassy soiree in Lima I remembered that one of my Labour predecessors, Lord George Brown, had been at a similar event in the same place and allegedly made a pass at a creature clad in gorgeous scarlet who turned out to be the Cardinal Archbishop of Lima."
"And I wondered why it had taken 52 years for a UK Foreign Secretary to visit this amazing place."
"It can’t have been the indiscretions of Lord George Brown."
"Why was it 25 years since any of my predecessors had been to Argentina or Chile?"
"It was because our entire global strategy has been focused on the EU."
"And while that may have been sensible in the 1970s, when we first joined the common market, it makes less sense in the globalised economy of today, when 95 per cent of the world’s growth is going to be outside the EU."
"Of course the EU is and will always be colossally important."
"But the rest of the world is proportionally gaining ground."
"And I was thrilled to find that even though our trade with these Latin American countries is still relatively small, the UK is already the second biggest investor in Peru, and that we already drink the second biggest quota of Argentinian Malbec."
"And that, following the success of the 2012 Olympics – I forgot to mention that – there are british consultants helping with the Pan-American games in Lima."
"And these are just the beginnings."
"Think what we could do with proper free trade deals."
"And that is why it is so sad, so desperately wrong, that we are preparing to agree terms with Brussels that would make it difficult if not impossible to do such deals."
"And that is why it is such a mistake for us to leave on the Chequers terms, locked in the tractor beam of Brussels."
"We will not only be prevented from offering our tariff schedules."
"We will be unable to make our own laws – to vary our regulatory framework for goods, agrifoods and much much more besides."
"This is politically humiliating for a £2 trillion economy."
"And it occurs to me that the authors of the Chequers proposal risk prosecution under the 14th century statute of praemunire, which says that no foreign court or government shall have jurisdiction in this country."
"It would mean that UK business and industry – the entire UK economy – would be exposed perpetually to regulations that might have been expressly designed, at the behest of foreign competitors, to do them down."
"It would mean that whatever the EU came up with, banning the sale of eggs by the dozen, banning diabetics from driving, banning vaping, whatever – and all of those have been at least considered by Brussels in the last few years – all of this nonsense we would have to implement with no ability to change or resist."
"This is not pragmatic, it is not a compromise."
"It is dangerous and unstable – politically and economically."
"My fellow Conservatives, this is not democracy."
"This is not what we voted for."
"This is an outrage."
"This is not taking back control: this is forfeiting control."
"And they know it in Brussels."
"Do not be fooled by the suggestion that the EU will ultimately reject these proposals."
"Because what they want above all is to demonstrate above all – to any other country that might even dream of following suit – that you cannot leave the EU without suffering adverse political or economic consequences."
"And what the Chequers proposals show is that the United Kingdom, for all its power and might and network of influences around the world, for all its venerable parliamentary history, was ultimately unable to take back control."
"And instead of reasserting our ability to make our own laws, the UK will be effectively paraded in manacles down the Rue de la Loi like Caractacus."
"Do not believe that we can somehow get it wrong now and fix it later – get out properly next year, or the year after."
"Total fantasy."
"The opposite will happen."
"I have been watching the EU professionally for 30 years, and every time a referendum goes against the federalist movement, I have seen how the centripetal forces lock on and slowly slowly the offending country is winched back into place."
"Indeed, by its manifest democratic injustice, Chequers provides the perfect logic and argument for those who want Britain to return to the EU, and is therefore a recipe for continued acrimony."
"If Chequers is agreed, then it will only embolden those who are now calling for a second referendum."
"These are the same people, incidentally, who explicitly told the electorate that there was no going back, that voting leave meant leaving the customs union and the single market, and that there was no way they would be asked again."
"They are now cynically campaigning to do just that, in a way that would be disastrous for trust in politics."
"People would see that they would be simply being asked to vote again until they give the answer the Remainers want."
"As Ruth Davidson has rightly pointed out, we cannot tell the Scots that they have made a decision to reject independence for a generation – and then ask the UK electorate to vote again on the EU."
"So the idea of a second vote is infamous – but the obvious democratic fragility of Chequers will only intensify such calls."
"Finally, do not believe them, when they say there is no other plan, no alternative."
"It is not my plan, or the ERG plan, or the IEA plan."
"All these models, which are substantially the same, a Supercanada trade deal at the heart of a deep and special partnership, are derived from the prime minister’s own vision at Lancaster House."
"So now therefore is the time truly to take back control and make the elegant dignified and grateful exit the country voted for."
"This is the moment – and there is time – to chuck Chequers, to scrap the Commission’s constitutionally abominable Northern Ireland backstop, to use the otherwise redundant and miserable “implementation period” to the end of 2020 to negotiate the Supercanada FTA, to invest in all the customs procedures that may be needed to ensure continued frictionless trade, and to prepare much more vigorously for a WTO deal."
"And if we get it right, then the opportunities are immense."
"It is not just that we can do free trade deals."
"In so many growth areas of the economy this country is already light years ahead."
"Tech, data, bioscience, financial services, you name it."
"We can use our regulatory freedom to intensify those advantages."
"And of course our European friends know that is possible – and that is exactly why they want to constrain us."
"Yet I would argue that it is actually in their interests too, to have the fifth biggest economy in the world, on their doorstep, acting as a continuing brake and caution to the over- regulatory instincts that have held the EU back for so long."
"Instead of being relentlessly homogenised, we can actually learn from each other again, in the spirit of friendly emulation that inspired the renaissance of European civilisation."
"If we get this right, it can be win-win for both sides of the Channel."
"If we get it wrong – if we bottle Brexit now – believe me, the people of this country will find it hard to forgive."
"If we get it wrong, if we proceed with this undemocratic solution, if we remain half-in half out, we will protract this toxic tedious business that is frankly so off-putting to sensible middle of the road people who want us to get on with their priorities."
"If we cheat the electorate – and Chequers is a cheat – we will escalate the sense of mistrust."
"We will give credence to those who cry betrayal, and I am afraid we will make it more likely that the ultimate beneficiary of the chequers deal will be the far right in the form of UKIP."
"And therefore the far Left in the form of Jeremy Corbyn – a man who takes money from Iranian TV, who can barely bring himself to condemn the Russian state for the Salisbury atrocity, who indulges anti-semitism, and who by opportunistically committing himself to the misery and farce of a second referendum, has finally revealed himself to be the patsy of the EU as well."
"We cannot allow it to happen."
"We must not allow it to happen."
"And so for one last time, I urge our friends in government to deliver what the people voted for, to back Theresa May in the best way possible, by softly, quietly, and sensibly backing her original plan."
"And in so doing to believe in conservatism and to believe in Britain."
"Because if we get it wrong we will be punished."
"And if we get it right we can have a glorious future."
"This government will then be remembered for having done something brave and right and remarkable and in accordance with the wishes of the people.I want to begin by paying tribute to David Cameron who has spoken earlier from Downing Street, and I know I speak for Michael [Gove] when I say how sad I am that he has decided to step down but obviously I respect that decision."
"I have known David Cameron for a very long time, and I believe he has been one of the most extraordinary politicians of our age."
"A brave and principled man, who has given superb leadership of his party and his country for many years."
"Delivering one nation Conservative government, making this country the most dynamic economy in Europe and with his own brand of compassionate Conservativism that rightly earned his party the first majority government for decades."
"It was his bravery that gave this country the first referendum on the European Union for 43 years."
"Today I think all of us politicians need to thank the British people for the way they have been doing our job for us."
"They hire us to deal with the hard questions and this year we gave them one of the biggest and toughest questions of all."
"Some people are now saying that was wrong and that people should never have been asked in that way."
"I disagree, it was entirely right and inevitable and there is no way of dealing with a decision on this scale except by putting it to the people."
"Because in the end this decision is about the people, the right of people in this country to settle their own destiny."
"The very principles of our democracy, the rights of all of us to elect and remove the people who make the key decisions in their lives."
"And I think that the electorate have searched in their hearts and answered as best they can in a poll the scale the like of which we have never seen before in this country."
"They have decided it is time to vote to take back control from a EU that has become too opaque and not accountable enough to the people it is meant to serve."
"In voting to leave the EU, it is vital to stress there is no need for haste, and as the prime minister has said, nothing will change in the short-term except how to give effect to the will of the people and to extracate this country from the supranational system."
"There is no need to invoke Article 50."
"And to those who may be anxious both at home and abroad, this does not mean that the United Kingdom will be in anyway less united, it does not mean it will be any less European."
"I want to speak directly to the millions of people who did not vote for this outcome, especially young people who may feel that this decision involves somehow pulling up the drawbridge because I think the very opposite is true."
"We cannot turn our backs on Europe."
"We are part of Europe, our children and our grandchildren will continue to have a wonderful future as Europeans, travelling to the continent, understanding the languages and the cultures that make up our common European civilisation, continuing to interact with the peoples of other countries in a way that is open and friendly and outward-looking."
"And I want to reassure everyone Britain will continue to be a great European power, leading discussions on defence and foreign policy and the work that goes on to make our world safer."
"But there is simply no need in the 21st century to be part of a federal government in Brussels that is imitated nowhere else on Earth."
"It was a noble idea for its time but it is no longer right for this country."
"It is the essence of our case that young people in this country can look forward to a more secure and more prosperous future, if we take back the democratic control which is the foundation of our economic prosperity."
"We have a glorious opportunity, to pass our laws and set our taxes entirely according to the needs of the U.K., we can control our borders in a way that is not discriminatory but fair and balanced and take the wind out of the sails of the extremists and those who would play politics with immigration."
"Above all we can find our voice in the world again, a voice commensurate with the fifth-biggest economy on earth."
"Powerful, liberal, humane, an extraordinary force for good in the world."
"The most precious thing this country has given the world is the idea of parliamentary democracy."
"Yesterday [Thursday], I believe the British people have spoken up for democracy in Britain and across Europe and we can be proud of the result.Boris Johnson: I would make sure that we have a plan that will convince our European friends and partners that we are absolutely serious about coming out and the key things that you got to do are to take the bits of the current withdrawal agreement, which is dead, take the bits that are serviceable and get them done."
"And that is number one."
"The stuff about European Union citizens, the 3.2 million, they need to be properly protected."
"I wanted that done the day after the referendum, you may remember."
"Their rights should be enshrined in an unconditional way in UK law, number one."
"Number two, you should look at the various other things that you could do to make progress with the bits of the withdrawal agreement that we have."
"I think the money is more difficult."
"I think the £39bn is at the upper end of the EU's expectations, but there is it, it's a considerable sum."
"I think there should be creative ambiguity about when and how that gets paid over."
"The important thing is that there should be an agreement that the solution of the border questions, the Irish border, the Northern Irish border questions, and all the facilitation that we want to produce, to get that done."
"All those issues need to be tackled on the other side of 31 October during what's called the implementation period."
"No, because you're going to need some kind of agreement and that's certainly what I'm aiming for in order, as you rightly say Laura, to get an implementation period."
"And I think, actually, that politics has changed so much since 29 March."
"I think on both sides of the Channel there's a really different understanding of what is needed."
"And on our side of the Channel we've got MPs in both the major parties who recognise that their parties face real danger of extinction at the polls and - you know - Labour went backwards in the recent council elections - unless we get Brexit over the line."
"And so I think there's going to be a willingness to move this thing forward."
"On the other side of the Channel, obviously, where you know they're watching this very carefully and we need obviously for both sides to come together, they've not got 29 Brexit MEPs in Strasbourg."
"They have the £39bn that they're they're keen to get."
"And, frankly, they also want Brexit to be done."
"Because I think that it is what the gentlemen have also said and what people have also said in all European capitals - and of course, in the [European] Commission - is that nobody wants a hard border in Northern Ireland and indeed nobody believes that it will be necessary."
"And so what we need is to hold that thought, which is true, which is agreed amongst all."
"And make sure that we reach the solutions the are achievable as both sides have said, as the Commission has said."
"The facilitations that can be reached, make sure that we deal with the solutions to the Irish border question and any other border questions because the Irish border question in microcosm stands for all the other facilitations that we'll around the EU."
"Let me tell you, there are abundant, abundant technical fixes that can be introduced to make sure that you don't have to have checks at the border."
"That's the crucial thing."
"And everybody accepts that there are ways you can check for the rules of origin, there are ways you can check for compliance with EU goods and standards, of our goods standards."
"Well, they do actually, in very large measure they do."
"You have trusted trader schemes, all sorts of schemes that you could put in to place."
"You're right, Laura, that there's no single magic bullet."
"But there is a wealth of experience, a wealth of solutions."
"And what's changed now is that there is a real positive energy about getting it done."
"Well, because I think on both sides of the Channel there's an understanding that we have to come out, but clearly Parliament has voted three times against the backstop arrangements that you rightly describe."
"And at present the UK, and any UK government, with this appalling choice of either being run by the EU whilst being outside the EU, which is plainly unacceptable, or else giving up control of the government in Northern Ireland."
"There is a way forward which I think, actually, to be fair all the candidates in the Conservative Party leadership contest broadly endorsed, which was to change the backstop, get rid of the backstop, in order to allow us to come out without this withdrawal agreement, and as far as I understand the matter, that is also the position of my remaining opponent."
"No that's not true at all, actually Laura."
"There was a very good report just today by Shanker Singham and many others looking at the modalities of how to do this."
"This is something that had been worked on extensively for the last three years."
"There are plenty of checks that you can do away from the border if you had to do them without any kind of hard infrastructure at the Northern Ireland frontier."
"Several reasons."
"First of all, don't forget, that as I say they got the Brexit MEPs they don't particularly want."
"They want us out, they've got the incentive of the money."
"They've also got to understand, Laura, is what has changed and what will be so different is that the intellectual capital that had been invested in the whole backstop had really come from the UK side."
"We were committed to it."
"We actually helped to invent it."
"We were the authors of our own incarceration."
"Take that away."
"Change the approach of the UK negotiators and you have a very different outcome."
"And simultaneously of course, and you know what I'm going to say, the other tool, the other tool of negotiation that you should use, not only the incentives of getting this thing done, moving it over the line, getting the money across and all the rest, but you have the extra incentive of course that the UK will be ready to come out as you know on WTO terms."
"You have to be, of course, my pledge is to come out of the EU at Halloween on 31 October."
"And the way to get our friends and partners to understand how serious we are is finally, I'm afraid, to abandon the defeatism and negativity that has enfolded us in a great cloud for so long and to prepare confidently and seriously for a WTO or no deal outcome."
"You've got to understand, Laura, listening to what I just said, that is not where I want us to end up."
"It is not where I believe for a moment we will end up."
"But in order to get the result that we want, in order to get the deal we need, the commonsensical protraction of the existing arrangements until such time as we have completed the free trade deal between us and the EU that will be so beneficial to both sides."
"The commonsensical thing to do is to prepare for a WTO exit."
"Now as it happens, by 29 March, a huge amount of work had been done and we had made great progress."
"There is still as you know some areas that need to be completed some things actually where the kind of level of preparedness is slightly sunk back again."
"In the real world, the UK government is never going to impose checks or a hard border of any kind in Northern Ireland."
"That's just number one."
"Number two in the real world the UK government is not going to want to impose tariffs on goods coming into the UK."
"Hang on, I'm coming to that point…    Of course that's right Laura."
"It's not just up to us, it's up to the other side as well."
"And there is an element of course, a very important element of mutuality and co-operation in this."
"And we will be working with our friends and partners to make sure that we have an outcome that is manifestly in the interests of people, of businesses, communities on both sides of the channel."
"I do    Well I do."
"I mean you've got to be very clear."
"I think Parliament now understands."
"That the British people want us to come out and to honour the mandate that they gave us."
"And I think that MPs on both sides of the House also understand that they will face mortal retribution from the electorate unless we get on and do it."
"Again, what has changed since 29 March is that my beloved party is down at 17 points in the polls."
"Labour isn't doing much better as I say with superhuman incompetence Corbyn managed to go backwards in the recent council elections."
"People want to get this thing done."
"They want to get it done sensibly."
"They want to get it done in a way that is generous to European Union citizens in our country and I stress that is the first thing to do."
"And they want to get it done in a way that allows us to move on which is why I think people are yearning, their yearning for this great Incubus to be pitchforked off the back of British politics."
"They want us to get on with some fantastic things for this country."
"And that is what we want to do."
"I... would love to tell you about all sorts of things Laura, but I've made it a rule over many, many years and I think you've interviewed me loads of times, I do not talk about stuff involving my family, my loved ones."
"And there's a very good reason for that."
"That is that, if you do, you drag them into things that, really, is, in a way that is not fair on them."
"Yes I get that, I totally get that."
"But my key point though is that the minute you start talking about your family or your loved ones, you involve them in a debate that is it is simply unfair on them."
"Look, I repeat my my key point too which is that over many, many years, and you can look back at innumerable statements I gave when I was mayor, I just do not go into this stuff, and there's a good reason for it."
"But it's actually I think what people want to know is what is going on with this guy?"
"Does he, does he, when it comes to trust, when it comes to character, all those things, does he deliver what he says he's going to deliver?"
"And that is the key thing."
"Well I think they're talking absolute nonsense."
"When I was mayor, when I became Mayor of London, when we said we would do something, we, I may say delivered not just x, but x plus 10."
"We did    Oh, nonsense."
"We built more affordable homes than under Labour."
"When you talk about the Tube we increased capacity on the Tube by about 30%."
"The biggest investment in infrastructure that I think the city has seen."
"I pledged to reduce crime."
"We reduced crime by about 20%."
"We reduced the murder rate which is a statistic that is very difficult to fudge, we reduced it by 50%."
"Hang on…    No, look."
"Take Nazanin Zaghari-Radcliffe and the other very difficult consular cases that we have with Iran."
"I think, of course, people will want to point the finger of blame at me if they possibly can, but actually all that does is serve to exculpate, lift the blame of the people who are really responsible, who are the Iranian Revolutionary Guard."
"And if you look, talk about overachieving in the Foreign Office, we were told that we had to orchestrate, and we did, an international response to the poisonings by Russia in Salisbury, and we thought we would be lucky to get 30 Russian spies expelled around the world in support of the UK by other countries."
"We actually got 153 spies expelled around the world, I don't think there's ever been a diplomatic coup like."
"So don't look at what people say about me look at what I actually deliver."
"No, I don't enjoy offending people."
"What I pledge to, you know, and what I think the people of this country want to hear, is I will be a politician who sticks by what I believe in."
"Yes, occasionally I may say things as I've said before that, causes offence, and I'm sorry for the offence and I'm sorry for the offence I caused, but I will continue to speak my mind because I think people deserve to hear what's going on in my head."
"They deserve to hear my approach to things."
"And you talk about my commitment to delivery."
"Actually look at the difficult things that I've taken on and and done."
"Nobody thought we could win in London either in 2008 let alone in 2012 when the Tory Party was actually 17 points behind in the polls and I overhauled that deficit."
"Nobody thought we could win the European Union referendum in 2016."
"And I played a role with others in getting that over the line."
"By the way, nobody thought the Olympic Games would be a huge success, and the Paralympic Games."
"I remember people writing them off, I remember people saying it was all going to be a fiasco."
"And they were a fantastic success."
"And if I have one message, forgive me, but I believe that we had amazing success when I was Mayor of London in using infrastructure, education, technology and bringing the greatest city on earth together and lifting people up across the city, closing the opportunity gap in London, giving people tools, whether it's better transport, better education, to take advantage of all the incredible things going on in this city."
"When I began we had four of the six poorest boroughs in London in the UK."
"After two terms, when I ended in London, there were none of the poorest 20 boroughs in the whole of the UK."
"The whole city came up and it was people on the lowest incomes who'd been helped by, by our living wage, who'd been helped by massive investment in public transport, who'd been helped by better education."
"It was they whose life expectancy had gone up the fastest and whose wealth had also increase."
"And I'm incredibly proud of that, incredibly proud of that."
"And what I want to do now, if I possibly can, and if I'm successful in this contest, and become leader and prime minister, what I really want to do is to bring our country together which has felt divided, which has felt a bit directionless, which has I think because of the failures of the political class, lost a sense of purpose and lost perhaps a bit of a sense of self belief."
"I want to bring this incredible country together to release the potential of the whole of the UK."
"That's what I want to do."
"And I pay tribute to Jeremy and enjoyed working with him then as I enjoyed working with him in government and who knows, look forward to working with him in the future."
"Look, you know I just always invoke the 11th commandment of Ronald Reagan which is thou shalt never speak ill of a fellow Conservative."
"And you know what I want to do is talk about my basic message which is to unite our country, bring the country together."
"Brexit was partly about objection to the one-way ratchet of European Union and democracy."
"Yes of course it was partly about immigration, but it was about huge parts of Britain feeling that they didn't have the same advantages, the same care, the same love, as London and the southeast, and that they were being a bit left behind."
"Well, that's an economic mistake."
"It's a political and it's a social mistake."
"We need to bring the country together."
"Infrastructure, education, technology."
"Give everybody the chance they deserve."
"Believe me they said that in 2008 before I became Mayor of London."
"The Guardian - highly reputable newspaper - ran a whole subsection in which people promised to flee the land or at least the city if I became mayor, eight years later most of them were still there."
"Many of them had gone to work with me and I had higher approval ratings by far when I left my office as mayor than when I began."
"And I ran London, yes of course, I believe in the democracy of our country and yes of course we are going to get Brexit done by 31 October."
"But be [in] no doubt that at heart I am a centre-right progressive modern Conservative and I will govern from the centre right because that is from the centre because that is where you win."
"That is where the broad mass of the people are."
"They understand that you need a dynamic market economy to pay for fantastic public services and infrastructure."
"And you need fantastic public services and infrastructure, great NHS, great education, to enable business to have the confidence to invest."
"And Jeremy Corbyn only understands one half of that."
"He's only interested in taxation and spending."
"He has no care, no love, no interest for business and for the wealth creators on whom we all depend."
"And you've got to have that balance in your government."
"Thank you.OK OK, I admit it."
"If you gave him a truth drug, or hypnotised him, I don't think even the prime minister would really deny it."
"This European Union deal is not perhaps everything that we would have liked."
"It is not what we Eurosceptics were hoping, not when the process kicked off."
"We were hoping he was going to get really deep down and dirty, in the way that the Bloomberg speech seemed to indicate."
"He was going to probe the belly of the beast and bring back British sovereignty, like Hercules bringing Eurydice (sic) back from the underworld."
"I had the impression that this was going to be the beginning of a wholesale repatriation of powers - over fisheries, farming, the social chapter, border controls, you name it: all those political hostages joyfully returning home like the end of Raid on Entebbe."
"It was going to be a moment for the ringing of church bells and bonfires on beacons, and union flags flying from every steeple, and peasants blind drunk on non-EU approved scrumpy and beating the hedgerows with staves while singing patriotic songs about Dave the hero."
"I don't think we can pretend that this is how things have turned out."
"This is not a fundamental reform of Britain's position in the EU, and no-one could credibly claim it is."
"It is not pointless; it is not wholly insignificant; it is by no means a waste of time."
"But it will not stop the great machine of EU integration, and it will not stop the production of ever more EU laws - at least some of which will have deleterious effects on the economy of this country and the rest of Europe."
"Never mind the Tusk deal; look at the elephant in the room: the great beast still trampling happily on British parliamentary sovereignty, and British democracy."
"So there are likely to be a significant number of people - perhaps including you - who will feel that in all honour we can now only do one thing."
"We said we wanted a reformed EU."
"We said that if we failed to get reform, then Britain could have a great future outside."
"We have not got a reformed EU - so: nothing for it, then - ho for the open seas!"
"Viva Brexit!"
"That would seem to be the logic, and yet I wonder if it is wholly correct."
"Shut your eyes."
"Hold your breath."
"Think of Britain."
"Think of the rest of the EU."
"Think of the future."
"Think of the desire of your children and your grandchildren to live and work in other European countries; to sell things there, to make friends and perhaps to find partners there."
"Ask yourself: despite all the defects and disappointments of this exercise - do you really, truly, definitely want Britain to pull out of the EU ?"
"Now?"
"This is a big thing to do, and there is certainly a strong political-philosophical imperative leading us to the door."
"We are being outvoted ever more frequently."
"The ratchet of integration clicks remorselessly forward."
"More and more questions are now justiciable by the European Court of Justice, including that extraordinary document, the European Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"This bestows on every one of our 500m EU citizens a legally enforceable right to do all sorts of things across all 28 states: to start a business, to choose any occupation they like, to found any type of religious school, to enjoy academic freedom."
"I shudder to think what is going to happen when UK citizens start vindicating these new rights in Luxembourg."
"There is going to be more and more of this stuff ; and I can see why people might just think, to hell with it."
"I want out."
"I want to take back control of our democracy and our country."
"If you feel that, I perfectly understand - because half the time I have been feeling that myself."
"And then the other half of the time, I have been thinking: hmmm."
"I like the sound of freedom; I like the sound of restoring democracy."
"But what are the downsides - and here we must be honest."
"There are some big questions that the out side need to answer."
"Almost everyone expects there to be some sort of economic shock as a result of a Brexit."
"How big would it be?"
"I am sure that the doomsters are exaggerating the fallout - but are they completely wrong?"
"And how can we know?"
"And then there is the worry about Scotland, and the possibility that an English-only leave vote could lead to the break-up of the union."
"There is the Putin factor: we don't want to do anything to encourage more shirtless swaggering from the Russian leader, not in the Middle East, not anywhere."
"And then there is the whole geostrategic anxiety."
"Britain is a great nation, a global force for good."
"It is surely a boon for the world and for Europe that she should be intimately engaged in the EU."
"This is a market on our doorstep, ready for further exploitation by British firms: the membership fee seems rather small for all that access."
"Why are we so determined to turn our back on it?"
"Shouldn't our policy be like our policy on cake - pro having it and pro eating it?"
"Pro Europe and pro the rest of the world?"
"If sovereignty is the problem - and it certainly is - then maybe it is worth looking again at the prime minister's deal, because there is a case for saying it is not quite as contemptible as all that."
"He is the first prime minister to get us out of ever closer union, which is potentially very important with the European Court of Justice and how it interprets EU law."
"He has some good stuff on competition, and repealing legislation, and on protecting Britain from further integration of the euro group."
"Now if this were baked into a real EU treaty, it would be very powerful."
"Taken together with the sovereignty clauses - which are not wholly platitudinous - you can see the outlines of a new role for Britain: friendly, involved, but not part of the federalist project."
"Yes, folks, the deal's a bit of a dud, but it contains the germ of something really good."
"I am going to muffle my disappointment and back the prime minister.Number one, Ross, we need to be increasing our spending on education around the country and lifting up the per capita spend."
"Number two, we want to have a big program of transport infrastructure."
"And I'm looking at all sorts of things we can do to help Andy Street in the West Midlands, Northern Powerhouse Rail, there's all sorts of things we can do to help with our roads."
"We need to be putting some money into the police and on Brexit."
"We will of course be pushing our plan into action."
"So we are getting ready to come out on October the 31st."
"Come what may."
"Do or die."
"Come what may."
"First of all we need to get rid of this current withdrawal agreement and get the best bits in it, put them through Parliament and then we want to make sure that we keep that money suspended, and waiting to hand it over if we get the deal that we want."
"And then we want to make sure that we come up with the solutions for the Northern Irish border."
"And I think that the way to come out is with a standstill between the UK and the EU so that we keep going with the existing arrangements until such time as we've completed our free trade agreement and we use that period to solve the questions of the Northern Irish border."
"I think we can do that."
"I think a bit of positive energy would help, frankly."
"I've never seen such morosity and gloom from a government."
"For three years we've been sitting around wrapped in defeatism telling the British public that they can't do this or that."
"It is pathetic, it's absolutely pathetic."
"Don't forget."
"We haven't even really wanted to come out."
"That's the whole, that's the, the heart of the problem."
"What we've been doing is we've been creating our own incarcerate, our in prison."
"The backstop, the customs union and the single market are all basically designed to keep us in."
"So plan B and C and D. Plan B, we get the deal we want the type I've described, Plan B is to get a standstill, the agreement GATT 24 paragraph 5B type agreement."
"If the EU won't do that and we have to come out on WTO terms then Plan C would be to get ready for that outcome."
"And obviously we're going to do that and it's very, very important that we do."
"And the British people have had enough of being told that they're incapable of getting ready to do this."
"Actually the preparations by March the 29th were pretty far advanced and they can be very far advanced by October 31st."
"What is this defeatism, this is unbelievable."
"Yes, let me tell you why."
"Okay."
"Because it would be up to the Prime Minister of the day."
"I hope myself, to decide under the current terms of the extension that we have, to apply for such an extension."
"And it is up to the EU to decide whether to grant it."
"At the moment, the law says that the UK is leaving the EU."
"International treaty law - says the UK is leaving the EU on the 31st of October."
"I think the withdrawal agreement itself as indeed Theresa May admitted in the House of Commons is defective and it's over."
"I mean more than a change."
"It's got to be, you know, we need a new Withdrawal Agreement."
"If we're going to go out on the basis of a withdrawal agreement at all."
"I think that it follows from everything that I've said, that I think politics is at a crossroads in this country."
"And it is fundamental to trust in politics that we come out of the EU."
"We've had two delays now."
"My friends and colleagues in, in Parliament is, they've had a long time now to think about this."
"Well, I don't want to cast any aspersions on my opponent."
"All I would say is that I think I have three key merits: I fought for Brexit."
"I believe in it."
"Unlike any other candidate in this election, I can deliver it unlike any other candidate in this election."
"I can also formulate a great, one nation, modern conservative agenda and show how it can unite the whole country unlike any other candidate."
"And, you look at what we did in London and, uh, I believe that I'm the only candidate who can actually, uh, get ready in due course to defeat Jeremy Corbyn."
"I like to paint."
"I make things."
"I make, I have a thing where I make models of..."
"When I was mayor of London..."
"I make, buses."
"I make models of busses."
"So what I do is well I don't make models of busses I get, I get old, um, wooden crates, right?"
"And I paint them and they have two, it's a box that's been used to contain two wine bottles right?"
"And it will have a dividing thing."
"And I turn it into a bus and I put passengers... you really want to know this?"
"No, I paint the passengers enjoying themselves."
"On a wonderful bus."
"Low carbon of a kind that we brought to the streets of London that reduces CO2, reduces nitrous oxide, reducing pollution."
"I've always greatly admired Pericles of Athens because he was the guy who said, uh, that politics was about the many, not the few."
"He was the first to use exactly that... a great orator."
"And, uh, he, uh, it was said that he thundered and lightened when he spoke."
"But what he did is he used great infrastructure."
"He invested in fantastic infrastructure."
"Uh, he developed the, the, not just the Acropolis, but the Piraeus port which was integral to the success of a lot of Athens."
"I'm a pretty, I, I think I'm a pretty, um, even tempered kind of guy."
"I don't easily get angry."
"Very good question."
"Um, I think, I think like all human beings, I probably feel happiest when I've accomplished something that I've worked very hard to do and that gives me so..."
"I always enjoy, I always enjoy campaigns."
"Uh, I love, I love campaigning."
"Um, but what makes me, what makes me happiest, I think is, is, is the sense of completing a great task."
"And that is what we must do and I will not be happy and I will not rest until we get out of the EU on October the 31st."
"It is not the beginning of any great task but the continuing of the same until we be thoroughly finished that yieldeth the true glory."
"Um, oh God, I don't know."
"What was the last sports match I watched, blimey."
"Well, I suppose I must've watched some, I don't ever watch TV anymore."
"I play tennis quite a lot."
"It's nice."
"I play tennis quite a lot."
"I have been at the box at Wimbledon."
"I tell you what I watched a cricket match."
"I watched, I went to watch England against someone, unfortunately I fell asleep."
"That went badly."
"Watch the whole interview with political editor Ross Kempsell here."
"‘Simply unfair’ to discuss family life in public"
