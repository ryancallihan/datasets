Well, erm, this, again, these are, these are big terms...what happened was, I can tell you the whole thing. Are you sure our viewers don't want to hear about? -

It was a long and lamentable story

What happened was I ascribed events that were supposed to have taken place before the death of Piers Gaveston to events that actually took place after the death of Piers Gaveston

I mildly sandpapered something somebody had said and yes it was very embarrassing and I'm very sorry for it.

Again, on that I never had any conversation with Michael Howard about that matter

I don't propose to go into all that again

I've been through that question a lot, watch the documentary, why don't we talk about something else?

All three things I would dispute

Well I do, if we had a long time I could explain that all three interpretations you're putting on those things aren't wholly fair.

I hadn't seen that Conrad had said that, but nonetheless I've got a great admiration for Conrad. He's a great journalist...
