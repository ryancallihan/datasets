China-Canada relations have met serious difficulties, and the Canadian side is solely responsible for this, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Thursday.

Geng Shuang made the comment at a press briefing when asked about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's remarks that the Canadian government would not "back down" in disputes with China.

Urging the Canadian side to reflect upon its mistakes, Geng said Canada should treat China's solemn position and concerns seriously and immediately release Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei.

Geng also criticized Canada's series of wrong comments on Hong Kong, saying that Hong Kong affairs are China's internal affairs and brook no interference from any country, organization or individual.

"We hope that the Canadian side could abide by the international law and the basic norms of international relations, and stop meddling in China's internal affairs," he said.
